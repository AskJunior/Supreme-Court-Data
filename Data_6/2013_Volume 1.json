G Custom - Defendant pleading a special family custom that a child from outside the family could not have been \u00b7 adopted - Held: He who relies upon custom varying general law, must plead and prove it - Special customs which prevailin a family, a particular community etc., require strict proof A and the defendants/respondents have faiied to prove the same - Evidence Act, 1872 - s.57 - Judicial notice. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908:. 0. 18, r. 16. - Power to examine witness immediately - B Held: Mere apprehension of death of a witness cannot be a sufficient cause for immediate examination of a witness - More so, it is the discretion of court to come to a conclusion as to whether there is a sufficient cause or not to examine the . witness immediately - In the instant case, plaintiff was just C above 70 years of age and hale and hearty and, as such, there was no occasion for her to file an application under 0. 18, r. 16 CPC for recording statement prior to commencement of trial. Evidence Act, 1872: D s.134 read with ss.138 and 146 - Number of witnesses and cross-examination - It is not the number of witnesses but quality of their evidence which is important - If a party wishes to raise any doubt as regards correctness of statement of a E witness, the said witness must be given an opportunity to explain his statement by drawing his attention to that part of it, which has been objected to - Without this, it is not possible to impeach his credibility.."
