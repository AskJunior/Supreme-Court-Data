Sikri, J.) \u2013 Entry 41 of List IIdeals with \u2018State Public Services\u2019 and \u2018State Public ServiceCommission\u2019 \u2013 It is undisputed that State Public Service Commissiondoes not exist in NCTD \u2013 When dealing with All India Services andDANICS Services etc., it is also doubtful to mention it as State PublicService \u2013 GNCTD has endeavoured to assume the executive powerin respect of \u2018services\u2019 by relying upon Entry 41 of List II, whichmay be doubtful \u2013 That situation may give discretionary powers tothe LG \u2013 On the other hand, it also cannot be said that once themanpower is allocated to Union Territory of Delhi, the GNCTDshould not have any power to deal with such employees \u2013 In such ascenario, and to avoid any conflict of exercise of powers betweenthe LG on the one hand and the Council of Ministers with Chief Minister as Head on the other hand, for the smooth functioning ofthe system, just and fair mechanism to be carved out \u2013 The transfersand postings of Secretaries, HODs and other officers in the scaleof Joint Secretary to the Government of India and above can bedone by the LG and the file submitted to him directly \u2013 For otherlevels, including DANICS officers, the files can be routed throughthe Chief Minister to the LG \u2013 In case of difference of opinionbetween the LG and the Chief Minister, the view of the LG wouldprevail and the Ministry of Home Affairs would issue a suitablenotification in that regard \u2013 However, for Grade IV, III, II and IDASS officials, there is an existing delegation of powers where forGrades IV and III, all transfers and postings are done by theSecretary (Services); for Grades II and I, the transfers and postingsare done by the Chief Secretary \u2013 For greater transparency, a CivilServices Board can be formed which can be headed by the Secretary(Services) for Grades IV and III officials; by the Chief Secretaryfor Grades II and I level officers \u2013 The Board can decide on thetransfer and postings of these DASS cadre officers \u2013 Similar Boardcan also be formed for DANICS officers \u2013 In the interest of goodgovernance and smooth Governmental function, efforts should bemade by both the Chief Minister as well as the LG for a harmoniousworking relation \u2013 (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)(Partly Dissenting) \u2013Entry 41 of List II of the Seventh Schedule is not available to theLegislative Assembly of GNCTD \u2013 Having held so, there is nooccasion to exercise any Executive power with regard to \u201cServices\u201dby the GNCTD, since the Executive power of the GNCTD as perArt.239AA(4) extend in relation to matters with respect to whichLegislative Assembly has power to make laws \u2013 With regard to\u201cServices\u201d GNCTD can exercise only those Executive powers, whichcan be exercised by it under any law framed by the Parliament or itmay exercise those Executive powers, which have been delegatedto it \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.239AA \u2013 Indian AdministrativeServices (Cadre) Rules, 1954 \u2013 r.2(c). Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 \u2013Whether the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Anti-CorruptionBranch (ACB) of the NCTD to investigate offences committed underthe Prevention of Corruption Act by the officials of the CentralGovernment and limiting the jurisdiction of the ACB to the employees of the GNCTD alone is legal \u2013 Held: ACB is not empowered toinvestigate into the offences of Central Government employees underthe Prevention of Corruption Act \u2013 Such investigation is carriedout by CBI \u2013 Therefore, it obviates the duality and conflict ofjurisdiction as well \u2013 As per Notifications dated 23.7.2014 and21.5.2015, the jurisdiction of ACB is limited to the employees ofGNCTD only \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.2(s) \u2013Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947.Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 2 \u2013Term \u2018police\u2019 occurring therein \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: It is a settledprinciple that legislative entries are to be interpreted in a broadand liberal manner consistent with imputing to them the widestamplitude and as including all ancillary and subsidiary matters \u2013The scope of the term \u2018Police\u2019 as occurring in Entry 2 of List IIcannot, therefore, be artificially restricted or limited to onlyconstitution of the Police force, but would take within its fold thelegislative (and, therefore, executive) power to exercise supervisionand control over the functioning of the Police so constituted,including by way of issuance of executive directions delineatingthe powers, functions and jurisdiction of different wings/sectionsof the Police \u2013 Entry 2 List II would also include the determinationas to the nature and scope of investigations to be done by the Police\u2013 Therefore, while establishing the ACB as a Police Station, it wouldbe permissible to circumscribe and limit the investigation sphere ofthe ACB.Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 1 \u2013Notification dated 23.7.2014 and 21.5.2015 \u2013 By these Notifications,the jurisdiction of ACB was limited to the employees of GNCTD \u2013Validity of these notifications challenged on the ground that s.2(s)empowers the State Government to notify a police station and theimpugned notification was issued by the Central Government andpost 69 th Amendment, the Central Government is not the StateGovernment for exercising power under s.2(s) \u2013 Held: No doubt,s.2(s) of the Cr.P.C. contemplates establishment of the police stationby the State Government \u2013 However, the Cr.P.C. also lays down theprocedure for making arrest, conducting investigation and submittingfinal reports \u2013 It does not contain any provision which prescribeswhat offences would be investigated by which police force \u2013 Theseprovisions do not provide how parallel jurisdiction of two policestations is to be demarcated \u2013 In fact, parallel jurisdiction toinvestigate is not contemplated by Cr.P.C. as that would result inchaos and anarchy and would frustrate the very purpose ofinvestigation \u2013 Therefore, the Government which has competenceover Entry 2 List II would have power to segregate and demarcatethe jurisdiction to investigate as between two police forces \u2013 Thus,the impugned notifications are valid \u2013 This conclusion becomesinevitable when Cr.P.C. is read with the Delhi Police Act, 1978 andother cognate enactments \u2013 Entry 1 of List II, subject matter whereofis \u2018public order\u2019, also stands excluded from the purview of GNCTDand is the exclusive domain of the Parliament/ Central Executive \u2013The term \u2018public order\u2019 includes cognizance of offences, search,seizure and arrest, followed by registration of reports of offences(FIRs), investigation, prosecution, trial and in the event ofconviction, execution of sentences as well \u2013 All these aspects are tobe construed conjointly \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.2(s)\u2013 Interpretation of Statutes.Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 \u2013 s.2(a) \u2013 Whether theGNCTD is an \u2018appropriate Government\u2019 under the Commission ofInquiry Act, 1952 \u2013 Held: s.3(8) of the General Clauses (GC) Actdefines Central Government \u2013 s.3(60) of the GC Act, on the otherhand, defines State Government \u2013 The GC Act also defines\u2018Government\u2019, \u2018State\u2019 and \u2018Union Territory\u2019 \u2013 No doubt, definitionof State as contained in s.3(58) includes Union Territory \u2013 In respectof Union Territory, the State Government would mean the CentralGovernment \u2013 The expression \u2018State Government\u2019 occurring in s.2(a)of the COI Act which defines \u2018Appropriate Government\u2019 would notmean GNCTD, a Union Territory \u2013 General Clauses Act \u2013ss.3(8) and 3(60).Electricity Act, 2003 \u2013 s.108 \u2013 Whether under s.108 of theElectricity Act, 2003 and under s.12 of the Delhi Electricity ReformsAct, 2000, the power to issue directions to the State Commission iswith the GNCTD \u2013 Held: Under s.2(5)(b) of the Electricity Act, 2003,Appropriate Government is the State Government having jurisdictionunder this Act in all those cases which do not come within the domainof \u2018Central Government\u2019 \u2013 Insofar as NCTD is concerned, it hasits own Commission, namely, DERC \u2013 DER Act also stipulates powersof Government in Part IV thereof \u2013 General powers of theGovernment, inter alia, include giving directions to the DERC inmatters of policy involving public interest, as the Government mayissue from time to time \u2013 These powers are akin to the powers givenunder s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 \u2013 Insofar as DER Act isconcerned, it is an enactment enacted by Legislative Assembly ofNCTD \u2013 It operates within the NCTD \u2013 Under this Act, DelhiGovernment has power to issue directions to the DERC in mattersof policies involving public interest \u2013 When such powers areconferred specifically to Delhi Government under DER Act, it cannotbe said that insofar as s.108 of the Electricity Act, 2003 is concerned,the expression \u2018State Government\u2019 therein would mean the CentralGovernment \u2013 Delhi Electricity Reforms Act, 2000 \u2013 s.12.Stamp Act, 1899 \u2013 Whether the GNCTD had the power torevise the minimum rates of Agricultural Land (Circle Rates) underthe provisions of Stamp Act, 1899 \u2013 GNCTD issued the notificationdated August 4, 2015 revising the rates of Agricultural Land (CircleRates) under the provisions of Indian Stamp Act, 1899 and DelhiStamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation of Instruments) Rules, 2007\u2013 Before issuing this notification, matter was not placed before theLG for his views or concurrence \u2013 Held: Notification dated August4, 2015 revising the rates of agricultural land (circle rates) istraceable to Entry 63 of List II and not to Entry 18 of List II \u2013 Saidnotification is issued under the provisions of 1899 Act and 2007Rules \u2013 Circle rates are fixed for the purpose of payment of stampduty \u2013 Therefore, they do not pertain to \u2018land\u2019 namely rights in orover land, land tenures etc. or transfer of alienation of agriculturalland etc. \u2013 Stamp duty is not a duty on instrument but it is in realitya duty on transfer of property \u2013 In that sense, the occasion for levyof stamp duty is the document which is executed as distinguishedfrom the transaction which is embodied in the document \u2013 However,even when the executive wing of Delhi Government takes a decision,the LG is also empowered to form its opinion \u2018on any matter\u2019 whichmay be different from the decision taken by his Ministers \u2013 Anymatter does not mean each and \u2018every matter\u2019 or \u2018every triflingmatter\u2019 but only those rare and exceptional matters where thedifference is so fundamental to the governance of the Union Territorythat it deserved to be escalated to the President \u2013 Therefore, the LGis not expected to differ routinely with the decision of Council ofMinister \u2013 At the same time, the proviso recognises that there maybe contingencies where LG and his Ministers may differ \u2013 In suchcircumstances, LG is supposed to refer the matter to the Presidentfor decision and act according to the decision given thereon by thePresident \u2013 It means that final say, in case of difference betweenLG and Council of Ministers, is that of the President \u2013 Such a schemeof things clearly contemplates that the Council of Ministers issupposed to convey its decisions to the LG to enable the LG to formhis view thereupon \u2013 The decision cannot be implemented withoutreferring the same to the LG in the first instance \u2013 More pertinently,the decision here touches upon the governance of the UT \u2013Therefore, views of LG should have been taken before issuingNotification dated August 4, 2015 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Schedule7 List II Entry 63 \u2013 Delhi Stamp (Prevention of Under-Valuation ofInstruments) Rules, 2007 \u2013 Notification dated August 4, 2015. Constitution of India \u2013 Art.239AA, clause (4) and its proviso\u2013 LG, role of \u2013 Normally, and generally, the LG is expected to honourthe wisdom of the council of ministers \u2013 He is also expected to clearthe files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly \u2013 Heis under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subjectmatter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, where ever situationso demands \u2013 That in fact is the facet of good governance \u2013Likewise, the executive is also expected to give due deference to theunique nature of the role assigned to the LG in the Constitutionalscheme \u2013 By and large, it demands a mutual respect between thetwo organs \u2013 Both should realise that they are to serve the peopleof NCTD \u2013 Mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for theeffective working of the system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.24 \u2013 Power to appointthe Special Public Prosecutor \u2013 Whether it is the LG or the GNCTDwhich has the power to appoint the Special Public Prosecutor unders.24, Cr.PC. \u2013 Held: Special Public Prosecutor is appointed as perthe provisions of s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. which is to the effect that powerto appoint Special Public Prosecutor is conferred both upon theCentral Government and the State Government \u2013 Insofar as NCTDis concerned, the \u2018State Government\u2019 means the LG for the purposesof s.24(8) of Cr.P.C. \u2013 In respect of Entries 1 and 2 of List III, theGNCTD has legislative competence under Art.239AA of theConstitution and that the LG under Art.239AA(4) of the Constitutionshall act on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers \u2013Constitution of India \u2013 Art.239AA"

No.4-EM was entitled to usethe name of the original registered and recognized state politicalparty and rejected the claim of respondent No.1 and respondentNo.3-VKS that the group led by VKS was the real group and wasentitled to use name and symbol of the party AIADMK \u2013 Writ petitionfiled by respondent No.1 before the High Court to assail the decisionof the ECI \u2013 The said writ petition is still pending \u2013 Meanwhile, aselections in the State of Tamil Nadu were announced, respondentNo.1 and the group of which he was a member moved an interimapplication before the High Court in the pending writ petition forpermission to use a suitable name for carrying out its politicalactivities \u2013 High Court allowed the same by order dated 9 th March,2018 \u2013 Aggrieved by the said decision, the SLP petitioner-EKPespousing the cause of the group led by EM, filed SLP \u2013 When theSLP, along with connected cases, was taken up for hearing on 28 thMarch, 2018, amongst others, it was pointed out to the Court thatthe impending elections to the local bodies were countermandedand as a result, the basis for instituting the interim application byrespondent No.1 did not exist \u2013 In that view of the matter, the interimorder passed by the High Court was kept in abeyance with thedirections that the ECI shall not pronounce its order and grantedliberty to the parties to approach this court in case of any notification for an election \u2013 Accordingly the SLP was disposed of \u2013 RespondentNo.1 filed the instant Application asserting that the bye-electionwas notified by the ECI on 31 st December, 2018 and the date ofpolling was fixed for 28 th January, 2019 \u2013 SLP petitioner andrespondent Nos.4 to 6, as well as respondent No.2, raised apreliminary objection about the maintainability of this application\u2013 Held: Respondent No.1 had no other option but to present theinstant application because of the publication of the electionschedule by the ECI, in light of the liberty given by this Court byorder dated 28 th March, 2018 \u2013 As liberty was given to the partieseven though the SLPs were ostensibly disposed of, not entertainingthis application, only because the order dated 28 th March, 2018records that SLPs are disposed of, would be completely trivializingthe spirit of the liberty given to the parties by this Court in thepeculiar fact situation \u2013 Respondent No.1 cannot be directed to goback to the High Court for the relief claimed in this applicationbecause similar relief was already considered by the Single Judgeof the High Court on 9 th March, 2018 in favour of the grouprepresented by the applicant \u2013 The directions given by the SingleJudge in the said order had not been independently challenged bythe ECI by filing SLP before this Court \u2013 Besides, it may not beappropriate for the Division Bench to re-visit the matters in issuedealt with in the judgment and interim order passed by the SingleJudge dated 9 th March,

pending consideration beforethe High Court ought to be compelled to first register itself as apolitical party and after following the process of obtainingrecognition could only then set up its claim for allotment of a reservedsymbol and use of name \u2013 Held: During the pendency of the writpetition, as elections in the State of Tamil Nadu were announcedand respondent No.1 and the group of which he was a member,wanted to contest the elections, they moved an interim applicationbefore the High Court in the pending writ petition \u2013 High Court deemed it appropriate to issue directions to allot common symbol tothe faction represented by respondent no.1 in different constituencieswhere they would nominate candidates to contest in ensuing elections\u2013 High Court was conscious of the fact that ordinarily commonsymbol can be allotted only to registered recognized political partyand if the ECI could do so in exercise of its plenary powers whenthe dispute is pending before it, there could be no impediment forthe writ court to pass appropriate directions especially when noreal prejudice would be caused to any other party and the claimregarding which faction is the real party has still not attained finalityand that would ensure a level playing field in the political spherefor the concerned factions \u2013 High Court was right in holding that ifECI considers itself competent to pass interim directions for ensuringlevel playing field to both the factions during the adjudication ofthe dispute pending before it, there is no reason why, on the samelogic the High Court, being a court of equity, is not competent to doso when the final decision of the ECI was still pending challengebefore it \u2013 Representation of the People Act, 1951 \u2013 s.29A \u2013Constitution of India

the question of invoking powers underparagraph 18 by it (ECI) would not arise \u2013 However, if the disputeis pending enquiry before ECI or the final decision of the ECI issub judice in the proceedings before the constitutional court,providing for an equitable arrangement in the interests of free andfair elections and to provide equal level playing field to allconcerned, would be a just and fair arrangement.Election Laws \u2013 Whether there was any impediment for thewrit court (High Court) to pass appropriate interim direction whilethe validity of the decision of the Election Commission (ECI) is sub judice before it \u2013 Held: High Court was right in holding that fordoing justice and protecting the interests of all concerned and touphold the democratic principles, including for ensuring free andfair elections, it would be just and proper to continue the interimarrangement as was directed by the ECI regarding allotment of acommon symbol to the political group represented by respondentno.1 especially when such relief would not cause any prejudice toany other person or party nor impinge upon the powers of the ECI\u2013 Symbols Order, 1968.Representation of the People Act, 1951 \u2013 s.29A \u2013 Allotmentof a common symbol \u2013 If the political group is not registered unders.29A of the 1951 Act and is not recognized as per the provisions ofSymbols Order, 1968, it may not be entitled to claim allotment of acommon symbol which is reserved for a registered and recognizedState/National political party \u2013 Paragraphs 9 to 11 would apply tosuch registered and recognized political party which provide for anoption of a reserved symbol \u2013 For any other candidate or candidatebelonging to unregistered or unrecognized party, his claim wouldbe dealt with under paragraph 12 of the Symbol Order, 1968 \u2013 Theclosest provision is paragraph 15 of the Symbol Order, which dealswith the powers of the ECI in relation to splinter groups or rivalfactions of the political party \u2013 But once that dispute is answeredby the ECI and that decision attains finality, the splinter group willhave no other option but to register itself as a political party andonly after fulfillment of the requirements specified in paragraphs6A to 6C of the Symbols Order, 1968, as applicable, may be givenrecognition as a National or State political party \u2013 In the instantcase, the decision of the ECI is sub judice before the High Courtand the claim of the group or faction of being the original registeredrecognized State political party represented by respondent No.1, issubject to the outcome thereof \u2013 Until such time, there is no justreason as to why the interim arrangement such as ordered by theECI in terms of the interim order dated 22 nd March, 2017, asapplicable to the group represented by respondent No.1, ought notto continue \u2013 The direction issued in terms of order dated 28 th March,2018, to keep the interim order of the High Court dated 9 th March,2018, in abeyance and consequently to restrain the ECI frompronouncing its order on the application preferred by the political group represented by respondent No.1 needs to be vacated \u2013However, considering the fact that the hearing on the writ petitionbefore the Division Bench of the High Court has almost reached atthe final stage, it is deemed appropriate to mould the reliefs in thefollowing terms: (a) If the writ petition is not finally disposed of bythe Division Bench of the High Court within four weeks from today,the ECI shall process the application of the group represented byrespondent No.1 in terms of the directions given by the High Courtby interim order dated 9 th March, 2018 and issue appropriatedirections within two weeks therefrom (i.e. four weeks plus twoweeks, from today) \u2013 (b) In the event, before the expiry of the statedperiod, the ECI intends to issue any Press Note or Notification forannouncing the bye-elections in respect of the vacant AssemblyConstituencies in the State of Tamil Nadu or Parliamentary Electionsfor 2019, as the case may be, it shall pass appropriate directions incompliance with the interim order of the High Court dated 9 th March,2018, within one week from the date of release of such Press Noteor Notification and in any case, before the date notified for filingof the nominations, whichever is earlier \u2013 Symbols Order, 1968."

creditors ought, ideally, to be entered into \u2013In any case, the figure of ninety per cent, in the absence of anythingfurther to show that it is arbitrary, must pertain to the domain oflegislative policy \u2013 Also, if the committee of creditors arbitrarilyrejects a just settlement and/or withdrawal claim, the NCLT, andthereafter, the NCLAT can always set aside such decision u/s. 60 \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency ResolutionProcess for Corporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 \u2013 Reg 30A.s. 210 \u2013 Private Information Utilities \u2013 Evidence providedby private information utilities \u2013 Plea that Private Information Utilities not governed by proper norms and evidence of loan defaultin records of such utility not conclusive evidence \u2013 Held: Regulations20 and 21 makes it clear that apart from the stringent requirementsas to registration of such utility, the moment information of defaultis received, such information has to be communicated to all partiesand sureties to the debt and an information utility shall expeditiouslyundertake the process of authentication and verification ofinformation \u2013 Evidence provided by private information utilities isonly prima facie evidence of default which is rebuttable by thecorporate debtor \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India(Insolvency Resolution Process for Corporate Persons) Regulations,2016 \u2013 Regulations 20 and 21ss. 18, 41, 42 and 28 \u2013 Resolution professional \u2013 Adjudicatorypower, under the Code and the Regulations \u2013 Held: It is clear fromthe Code as well as the Regulations that the resolution professionalhas no adjudicatory powers \u2013 Resolution professional is givenadministrative as opposed to quasi-judicial powers \u2013 Even whenthe resolution professional is to make a \u201cdetermination\u201d underRegulation 35A, he is only to apply to the Adjudicating Authorityfor appropriate relief based on the determination made \u2013 Thus, theresolution professional is really a facilitator of the resolution process,whose administrative functions are overseen by the committee ofcreditors and by the Adjudicating Authority \u2013 Insolvency andBankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Resolution Process forCorporate Persons) Regulations, 2016 \u2013 Regulations 10, 12, 13,14, and 35A.s. 29A(as amended) \u2013 Retrospective application \u2013 Submissionthat vested rights of erstwhile promoters to participate in the recoveryprocess of a corporate debtor have been impaired by retrospectiveapplication of s. 29A \u2013 Held: A statute is not retrospective merelybecause it affects existing rights or merely because a part of therequisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing\u2013 Resolution applicant has no vested right for consideration orapproval of its resolution plan \u2013 By application of s. 29A, no vestedright is taken away \u2013 Since a resolution applicant who applies u/s.29A(c) has no vested right to apply for being considered as aresolution applicant, submission cannot be accepted. s. 29A and s.35(1)(f) proviso \u2013 s. 29A if restricted tomalfeasance \u2013 Submission that s. 29A puts a blanket ban onparticipation of all promoters of corporate debtors, without anymechanism to weed out the unscrupulous as against the efficientmanager but who have not been able to pay off their debts due toother reasons \u2013 Held: s. 29A not restricted to malfeasance \u2013Legislative purpose which permeates s. 29A continues to permeatethe Section when it applies not merely to resolution applicants, butto liquidation also.s. 29(A)(c) \u2013 One year period in s. 29A \u2013 Non-performingasset \u2013 Plea that u/s. 29A(c), a person\u2019s account may be classifiedas a non- performing asset even though he is not a wilful defaulter;and that the period of one year referred in clause (c) is whollyarbitrary and without any basis either in rationality or in law \u2013Held: A person is a defaulter when an installment and/or intereston the principal remains overdue for more than three months, afterwhich, its account is declared NPA \u2013 During the period of one yearthereafter, this grace period is given to such person to pay off thedebt \u2013 If a person is unable to repay a loan taken, in whole or inpart, within this period of one year and three months, he would beineligible to become a resolution applicant \u2013 This legislative policycannot be found fault with \u2013 Neither can the period of one year befound fault with.ss. 29A(j) and 5(24A) \u2013 Related party \u2013 Plea that personswho may be relatives of erstwhile promoters are debarred frombecoming a resolution applicant \u2013 Held: Persons who act jointly orin concert with others are connected with the business activity ofthe resolution applicant \u2013 Similarly, all the categories of personsmentioned in s. 5(24A) show that such persons must be \u201cconnected\u201dwith the resolution applicant within the meaning of s. 29A(j) \u2013 Thus,the said categories of persons who are collectively mentioned underthe caption \u201crelative\u201d obviously need to have a connection with thebusiness activity of the resolution applicant \u2013 In the absence ofshowing that such person is \u201cconnected\u201d with the business of theactivity of the resolution applicant, such person cannot possibly bedisqualified u/s. 29A(j) \u2013 Explanation I clause (ii) to s. 29A(j) makesit clear that if a person is otherwise covered as a \u201cconnected person\u201d,this provision would also cover a person who is in management orcontrol of the business of the corporate debtor during the implementation of a resolution plan \u2013 Thus, any such person is notindeterminate at all, but is a person who is in the saddle of thebusiness of the corporate debtor either at an anterior point of timeor even during implementation of the resolution plan.s. 29A \u2013 Exemption of micro, small and medium enterprisesfrom s. 29A \u2013 Justification of \u2013 Held: Justified \u2013 Rationale forexcluding such industries from the eligibility criteria laid down inss. 29A(c) and 29A(h) is because qua such industries, otherresolution applicants may not be forthcoming, which then willinevitably lead not to resolution, but to liquidation \u2013 Micro, Smalland Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 \u2013 s. 7.s. 53 \u2013 Distribution of assets \u2013 Submission that in the event ofliquidation, operational creditors would never get anything as theyrank below all other creditors, including other unsecured creditorswho happen to be financial creditors, thus s. 53(1)(f) discriminatoryand arbitrary thus, violative of Art. 14 \u2013 Held: s. 53 does not violateArt. 14 \u2013 Repayment of financial debts infuses capital into theeconomy inasmuch as banks and financial institutions are able,with the money that has been paid back, to further lend such moneyto other entrepreneurs for their businesses \u2013 This rationale createsan intelligible differentia between financial debts and operationaldebts, which are unsecured, which is directly related to the objectsought to be achieved by the Code \u2013 So long as there is somelegitimate interest sought to be protected, having relation to theobject sought to be achieved by the statute, Art. 14 does not getinfracted \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14.Object and reasons for the Code \u2013 Explained.Enactment and working of the Code \u2013 Explained.Companies Act, 2013: s. 412 \u2013 Selection of members oftribunal and appellate tribunal \u2013 Plea that appointment of membersof the NCLT and the NCLAT contrary to Madras Bar Association(III)\u2019s case \u2013 s. 412 whereby members of the tribunal and appellatetribunal to be selected, two judicial members of the SelectionCommittee get outweighed by three bureaucrats

direction of thisCourt. Judiciary: NCLAT Bench \u2013 Creation of Circuit Benches \u2013Submission that NCLAT Bench has a seat only at New Delhi and iscontrary to the judgment in Madras Bar Association (II) case \u2013Held: In view of the assurance by the Attorney General that CircuitBenches would be established soon, issuance of direction to Unionof India to set up Circuit Benches of the NCLAT within the stipulatedperiod.Constitution of India: Art. 77 \u2013 Submission that the tribunals-NCLT and NCLAT are functioning under the wrong Ministry-Ministryof Corporate Affairs, however, as per the Madras Bar Association(I)case the administrative support for all the tribunals should be fromthe Ministry of Law and Justice \u2013 Held: Rules of business beingmandatory in nature and having to be followed, are to be followedby the executive branch of the Government \u2013 However, this Court isbeing bound by the Madras Bar Association(I), the Union of Indiato follow the judgment, both in letter and spirit."

(HTPL) afterthe amendment of the arbitration agreement \u2013 Since the paymentwas not made by HTPL to appellant and who also subsequently didnot make payment for the supplied goods to the respondent, therespondent invoked the arbitration clause under agreement dated14.12.1993 \u2013 Arbitral tribunal passed award in favour of therespondent which was confirmed by the High Court \u2013 In the instantappeal, the case of the appellant was that it used to supply thegoods of the respondent to customers as per agreement dated14.12.1993 only \u2013 However, the appellant had to make deviationfrom this procedure at the request of the respondent by allowing thecustomers arranged by the respondent to lift its goods stored in theappellant\u2019s godown and in such case, the appellant was not boundby the contract since such contract was independent from theagreement dated 14.12.1993 \u2013 Held: It is evident from the subsequent agreement between HTPL and the respondent that a direct agreementexisted between them \u2013 However, the appellant received itscommission in its entirety for the HTPL transaction, and thus clearlywas a beneficiary of the agreement between the respondent andHTPL \u2013 Series of correspondences amongst appellant, respondentand HTPL also revealed that the appellant was also actively involvedin the transaction in question entered into between the respondentand HTPL, and as such was a beneficiary under their agreement \u2013The issuance of letters of credit in the name of the appellant withrespect to the HTPL transaction was similar to the practice adoptedin case of letters of credit or demand drafts issued in all othertransactions, whether directly negotiated by the respondent, orprocured through the appellant, which suggested that it was theduty of the appellant in this case as well to ensure that letter ofcredits issued were bona fide, and in case of stand-by letters ofcredit, that they were negotiated in time in case of failure of paymenton the due date, in terms of agreement dated 14.12.1993 \u2013 In thisview of the matter, it is not open to the appellant to argue that theagreement between the Respondent and HTPL was independent ofthe agreement dated 14.12.1993 between the appellant and therespondent and that the latter did not apply to such transaction \u2013Thus, there was no reason to disturb the award on the ground that the subject matter of the dispute was not arbitrable.."
