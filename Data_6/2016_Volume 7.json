Securities and Exchange Board of India (Collective Investment Sche111es) Regulations, 1999: Regn. 5 - \"existing collective invest111ent scheme\" - Connotation of - Held: An existing collective investment scheme, at the time of notification of the regulations, could only be one which had com111enced its activities prior to 25.1.1995 - A collective investment scheme, which commenced after 25.1.1995, could not be described as an \"existing\" collective investment scheme, because the same was statutorily barred, and wholly impermissible in law. Criminal jurisprudence: Held: There can be no doubt whatsoever, that the particulars of the offeni;e, of which an accused is charged, have to be clearly stated to him - No amount of evidence can be looked into, for an accusation not levelled or m,vfe out, in a complaint - This is one of the basic tenets of the criminal ;urisprudence. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: G H s.251 - Scope of- Where implications of various proviso to a section are different, mere mention of section in complaint would not amount to disclosing to the accused, the particulars of the offence of which they were accused - In the instant case, in the complaint, director of the company was accused of violating s.12(1 B) of SEBI Act - s.12(1 BJ has two categories for two class of persons - Implications for proviso category and the non-proviso category aredifferent -A perusal of the charge-sheet reveals, that the respondents were being treated as belonging to the proviso category - But 'the Board' treated them as belonging to the non-proviso category - This is clearly impermissible - s.251 will not remedy the above defect and deficiency in the complaint - Securities and Exchange Board Act, 1992. A s.465 - Omissions or irregularities in matters of procedure - Held: There can be no doubt that omissions and/or irregularities in matters of procedure can be overlooked, subject to the condition, that such an omission or irregularity does not occasion \"failure of iustice\" - Lack of material facts, which are vital to establish the ingredients of an offence, cannot be viewed as a procedural omission - The above requirement is not procedural, but substantive - irregularity and omission in the present case, in not disclosinR to the accused, the particulars of the offence for which they were being proceeded against, would occasion \"failure of ;ustice\" - Practice and Procedure - Procedural irregularitie"

Legislation: Statutory overruling - Held: When a law is enacted with retrospective effect, it is not an encroachment upon judicial power when the legislature does not directly overrule or reverse a judicial dictum - Legislature cannot, by way of an enactment, declare a decision of a court as erroneous or nullity - However, it has the power to rectify a defect in law noticed in the decision of the court - When such an amendment is made, the purpose thereof is not to overrule the decision of the Court, but to enact a fresh law with retrospective effect to alter the foundation and meaning of the legislation and to remove the base on which the judgment was founded - This does not amount to statutory overruling by the legislature. F Co/ourable legislation - Doctrine of co/ourable legislation does not involve any question of bona fide or malafide on the part of the legislature - The whole doctrine revolves itself into question of competence of a particular legislature to enact a particular law - Once it is held that the legislature has the power to enact the law as per its wisdom, and that too with retrospective effect, it cannot be said that the enactment is a co/ourable exercise. G Competence of legislature - To enact a law w.ej. the period when the legislature itself was not existent - Held: After legislature comes into existence, it has the competence to enact any law retrospectively or prospectively within the constitutional parameters."

Minor contradictions in prosecution evidence - Effect on prosecution case - Held: Minor contradictions, inconsistencies or insignificant embellishments do not affect the core of the prosecution case and should not be taken to be a ground to reject the prosecution evidence - The omission should create a serious doubt about the truthfulness or creditworthiness of a witness - It is only the serious contradictions and omissions which materially affect the case of the prosecution but not every contradiction or omission. Delay/Laches: Delay in examination of prosecution witness/child witnesses - Effect of- Held: The trial court observed that child witness (PW5) was cross-examined on practically every detail of the prosecution story and her statement corroborated every part thereof - It was rightly observed by the Trial Judge that the delay was on account of the fact that the Investigating Officer wanted to assure himself of the veracity of her statement and hence, she was examined after G she had time to recover from the shock of the incident and compose herself - Under these circumstances, any delay in examining this witness uls. 161 of Cr.P.C. will not prejudice the_pTosecution - Code - \u00b7of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.161.Delay in sending FIR to Magistrate - Held: Although in termsof s.J 57 Cr:P.C., the police officer concerned is required to forward a copy of the FIR to the Magistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence, promptly and without undue delay, it cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that whenever there is some delay in sending the FIR to the Magistrate, the prosecution version becomes unreliable and the trial stands vitiated - When there is posiii\"'le evidence to the fact that the FIR was recorded without unreasonable delay and investigation started on the basis of that FIR and there is no other infirmity brought to the notice of the Court, then in the absence of any prejudice to the accused, it cannot be concluded that the investigation was tainted and the prosecution story rendered unsupportable - Code of Criminal Procedure, I 97 3 - s.157."
