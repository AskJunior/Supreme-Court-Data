Principle of moulding relief and interlocutory mandatory injunction \u2013 Difference between \u2013 Held: Principle of moulding of relief can be resorted to at the time of consideration of final relief in the main suit and not at an interlocutory stage \u2013 Interlocutory mandatory injunction can be granted only to restore the status quo and not to establish a new set of things differing from the state which existed on the date when the suit was instituted.

Until the Presidential Notification issuedu/Arts.341(1) and 342(1) is modified by appropriate amendment byParliament in exercise of the power u/Arts. 341(2) or 342(2), thePresidential Notification is final and conclusive \u2013 No caste or groupcan be added to it or subtracted by any action either by the StateGovernment or by a Court.Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Harmonious construction \u2013 Held:Inter-related statutory as well as constitutional provisions have tobe harmoniously construed and understood so as to avoid makingany provision nugatory and redundant.[Per Ranjan Gogoi, J.(for himself, N.

Revision: Exercise of revisional jurisdiction \u2013 Where the material evidence was overlooked either by the trial Court or by the appellate Court or the order is passed by considering irrelevant evidence, the revisional jurisdiction can be exercised by the High Court \u2013 Penal Code, 1860. Evidence: Embellishments or exaggerations in the testimony \u2013 Evidentiary value of the testimony \u2013 Held: The testimony of a witness cannot be discarded in toto merely due to the presence of embellishments or exaggerations \u2013 The doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means \u201cfalse in one thing, false in everything\u201d is inapplicable in the Indian scenario,where the tendency to exaggerate is common \u2013 Doctrine. Evidence: In cases involving a large number of offenders and a large number of victims, the evidence of only two or three witnesses who give a consistent account of the incident is sufficient to sustain conviction. Evidence: Ocular and medical evidence \u2013 Conflict between the ocular testimony and the medical evidence \u2013 Medical evidence cannot override the evidence of ocular testimony of the witnesses \u2013 Ocular testimony to prevail \u2013 Where the eye witnesses account is found to be trustworthy and credible, medical opinion pointing to alternative possibilities is not accepted as conclusive. Constitution of India: Art.136 \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: The restriction as contained under s.401(3) of the Cr.P.C. on the High Court cannot restrict the powers of the Supreme Court under Art.136 of the Const itution \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.401(3).

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238 \u2013 Non-obstante clause \u2013 Held: s.238 of the Code would apply in case there is an inconsistency between the Code and the Arbitration Act \u2013 In the instant case, there is no such inconsistency \u2013 On the contrary, the award passed under the Arbitration Act together with the steps taken for its challenge would only make it clear that the operational debt happens to be a disputed one \u2013 Appellate Tribunal, when it relied upon Form V Part 5 of the 2016 Rules to state that the operational debt would, therefore, be said to have been proved, missed the vital sub-clause (iii) in para 34 of Mobilox Innovations case \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
