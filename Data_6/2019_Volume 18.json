dispute of ownership between Hindu community and Muslim community over piece of land admeasuring 1500 square yards in the town of Ayodhya \u2013 Hindu community claimed the disputed site to be the birth-place of Lord Ram, referring it as Ram Janmabhumi or Ram Janmasthan and asserting that there existed at the disputed site an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Ram, which was demolished by Mughal Emperor Babur \u2013 Muslim community however claimed it as the site of the Babri Masjid (mosque) built by or at the behest of Babur on vacant land \u2013 Suit 1 was filed by a worshipper for enforcement of his right to worship Lord Ram at the Janmabhumi \u2013 Suit 2 seeking reliefs similar to those in Suit 1 was however subsequently withdrawn \u2013 Suit 3 filed by Nirmohi Akhara (representing a religious sect amongst Hindus) was for handing over the management and charge of the Janmabhumi temple to it \u2013 Suit 4 filed by Sunni Central Waqf Board was for a declaration that the entirety of the disputed site, including Babri Masjid and the surrounding graveyard, is a public mosque and for a decree for possession \u2013 Suit 5 was filed by the deity of Lord Ram and the Janmasthan (both of whom were asserted to be juridical persons) through a next friend impleaded as a third plaintiff for a declaration that the entire premises constitute Ram Janmabhumi and for an injunction against interference in construction of new temple after demolition of the existing building \u2013 All the suits were transferred by the High Court to itself \u2013 In a split 2:1 verdict, the High Court held that the Hindu and Muslim parties were joint holders of the disputed premises \u2013 Each of them was held entitled to one third of the disputed property \u2013 Nirmohi Akhara was granted the remaining one third \u2013 A preliminary decree to that effect was passed  in the suit brought by the idol and the birth-place of Lord Ram through the next friend \u2013 On appeal, held: Disputed site was one composite whole \u2013 On balance of probabilities, clear evidence to indicate that worship by Hindus in the outer courtyard of the premises continued unimpeded in spite of the setting up of a grill-brick wall in 1857 by British colonial administration \u2013 Hindus established a clear case of a possessory title to the outside courtyard by virtue of long, continued and unimpeded worship at the Ramchabutra and other objects of religious significance \u2013 As regards the inner courtyard, evidence on preponderance of probabilities to establish worship by the Hindus prior to annexation of Oudh by the British in 1857 \u2013 Muslims offered no evidence to indicate that they were in exclusive possession of the inner structure prior to 1857 \u2013 Sunni Central Waqf Board did not establish its case of dedication by user or alternate plea of adverse possession \u2013 Existence of the structure of a mosque until 6 December 1992 however does not admit any contestation \u2013 Submission that the mosque did not accord with Islamic tenets, also not tenable \u2013 Muslims have been wrongly deprived of a mosque which had been constructed well over 450 years ago \u2013 While a decree must ensue in Suit 5, Suit 4 (instituted by Sunni Central Waqf Board) must also be partly decreed by allotment of alternate land to the Muslims for construction of a mosque and associated activities \u2013 Allotment of land to the Muslims is necessary because though on a balance of probabilities, evidence in respect of possessory claim of the Hindus to the composite whole of the disputed property stands on a better footing than the evidence adduced by the Muslims, the Muslims were dispossessed upon the desecration of the mosque in December 1949 which was ultimately destroyed on 6 December 1992 \u2013 Justice would not prevail if the Court were to overlook the entitlement of the Muslims \u2013 Direction issued that land admeasuring 5 acres be allotted to Sunni Central Waqf Board either by the Central Government out of the acquired land or by Government of Uttar Pradesh within the city of Ayodhya \u2013 This exercise, and the consequent handing over of the land to the Sunni Central Waqf Board, to be conducted simultaneously with the handing over of the disputed site comprising of the inner and outer courtyards as a consequence of the decree in Suit 5 \u2013 Suit 4 shall stand decreed in the above terms \u2013 Central Government to frame scheme in exercise of powers conferred upon it by ss.6 and 7 (of the Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act 1993) to set up a trust or any other appropriate mechanism to whom the land would be handed over in terms of the decree in Suit 5 \u2013 Suit 3 filed by Nirmohi Akhara barred by limitation and Nirmohi Akhara\u2019s claim to be a shebait stands rejected \u2013 However, having regard to the historical presence of Nirmohi Akhara at the disputed site and their role, direction issued that in framing the scheme, an appropriate role in the management would be assigned to the Nirmohi Akhara \u2013 Right of the plaintiff in Suit 1 to worship at the disputed property affirmed subject to restrictions by relevant authorities with respect to maintenance of peace and order and performance of orderly worship \u2013 Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act 1993 \u2013 ss.6 and 7 \u2013 Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art. 142. Partition \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 High Court held that the Hindu and Muslim parties were joint holders of the disputed premises \u2013 Each of them was held entitled to one third of the disputed property \u2013 Nirmohi Akhara was granted the remaining one third \u2013 A preliminary decree to that effect was passed in the suit brought by the idol and the birth-place of Lord Ram through the next friend \u2013 Decree for partition by High Court \u2013 Legality \u2013 Held: Three-way bifurcation by the High Court was legally unsustainable \u2013 High Court was not seized of a suit for partition \u2013 High Court adopted a path which was not open to it and granted reliefs which were not the subject matter of the prayers in the suits \u2013 In the process of doing so, it proceeded to assume the jurisdiction of a civil court in a suit for partition, which the suits before it were not \u2013 Order VII Rule 7 of CPC does not entitle the court in a civil trial to embark upon the exercise of recasting virtually the frame of a suit, which was undertaken by the High Court \u2013 There was no basis in the pleadings before the High Court and certainly no warrant in the reliefs which were claimed to direct a division of the land in the manner that a court would do in a suit for partition \u2013 High Court completely erred in granting relief which lay outside the ambit of the pleadings and the cases set up by the plaintiffs in Suit 3 (filed by Nirmohi Akhara), Suit 4 (filed by Sunni Central Waqf Board) and Suit 5 (brought by the idol and the birth- place of Lord Ram through the next friend) \u2013 Further, having come to the conclusion that Suit 3 and Suit 4 were barred by limitation, the High Court proceeded to grant relief in Suit 5 to the plaintiffs in Suits 3 and 4 \u2013 This defies logic and is contrary to settled principles of law \u2013 Moreover, the claim by Nirmohi Akhara was as a shebait who claimed a decree for management and charge \u2013 On its own case, Nirmohi Akhara could not have been granted an independent share of the land \u2013 Even as a matter of maintaining public peace and tranquillity, the solution which commended itself to the High Court is not feasible \u2013 The disputed site admeasures all of 1500 square yards \u2013 Dividing the land will not subserve the interest of either of the parties or secure a lasting sense of peace and tranquillity \u2013 CPC \u2013 Or.VII, r.7. Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act 1991 \u2013 Object and Purpose \u2013 Held: The Act prohibits the conversion of place of worship and imposes a positive obligation to maintain the religious character of every place of worship as it existed on 15 August 1947 \u2013 The Places of Worship Act was enacted to secure the fundamental values of the Constitution \u2013 Tolerance, respect and acceptance of the equality of all religious faiths is a precept of fraternity \u2013 Parliament determined that independence from colonial rule furnishes a constitutional basis for healing the injustices of the past. Limitation \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi - Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Suit filed by Nirmohi Akhara (representing a religious sect amongst Hindus) for handing over the management and charge of the Janmabhumi temple to it \u2013 Maintainability of the suit \u2013 Held: The City Magistrate had attached the disputed property by order dated 29th December, 1949 u/s.145 CrPC, 1898 \u2013 The suit was filed for restoration of management and charge so as to enable the Nirmohi Akhara to have the benefit of the usufruct in discharge of its obligations towards the deity \u2013 It was not a suit for possession \u2013 Hence, neither Art.142 nor Art.144 of Limitation Act, 1908 has any application \u2013 The suit was governed by provisions of the residuary article, Art.120 \u2013 Period of limitation u/Art.120 is six years \u2013 Nirmohi Akhara claimed that the cause of action arose on 5th January, 1950 when the receiver appointed by the Magistrate took charge of the property and they were denied charge and management of the temple \u2013 Since the suit was instituted on 17th December, 1959 (i.e. after more than nine years) it was outside the prescribed period of limitation and was thus barred \u2013 Alternate submission on behalf of Nirmohi Akhara by virtue of s.23 of the Limitation Act, 1908 that denial or obstruction of its\u2019 shebait rights of management and charge was a continuing wrong, also not tenable \u2013 Limitation Act, 1908 \u2013 Art. 120 \u2013 CrPC,1898 \u2013 s.145. Limitation \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Maintainability of suit \u2013 Suit filed by Sunni Central Waqf Board for declaration that entirety of the disputed site, including Babri Masjid and the surrounding graveyard, is a public mosque and for a decree for possession \u2013 Whether suit barred by limitation \u2013 Held: The grievance of the plaintiffs was that they were in possession and had offered prayers till 23rd December, 1949 on which date it was alleged that the mosque was desecrated \u2013 By pleading specifically that the plaintiffs were in possession and had offered prayers until a particular date, the sequitur is that after that date, the plaintiffs ceased to be in possession \u2013 The suit in the circumstances was a suit for possession of immoveable property falling in the description provided by the first column of Art.142 of the Limitation Act, 1908; and having been instituted on 18th December, 1949, i.e. within a period of twelve years of the date of alleged dispossession on 23 rd December, 1949, it was within limitation \u2013 Even if the plaintiffs were not in exclusive or settled possession of the inner courtyard of the disputed site, the suit would fall within the residuary Art. 144 in which event also, the suit would be within limitation \u2013 Limitation Act, 1908 \u2013 Arts. 142 and 144. Limitation \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Maintainability of the suit \u2013 Suit filed by deity of Lord Ram and Janmasthan (both of whom were asserted to be juridical persons) through a next friend impleaded as a third plaintiff for declaration that the entire premises constitute Ram Janmabhumi and for injunction against interference in construction of new temple after demolition of the existing building \u2013 Whether suit barred by limitation \u2013 Held: In three earlier suits centering around the dispute, neither of the plaintiffs in the instant suit were impleaded \u2013 Case of plaintiffs that institution of the instant suit was necessitated as a result of the deity not being a party to the earlier suits, and on the apprehension that in those suits, personal interests of the leading parties were being pursued without protecting the independent needs and concerns of the deity of Lord Ram, is well and truly borne out  by the proceedings \u2013 Cause of action in the instant suit cannot be considered to be barred by limitation on proper construction of the basis of cause of action for institution of the suit \u2013 Suit at the behest of the first plaintiff (deity of Lord Ram) who is a juristic person, is within limitation and maintainable \u2013 The third plaintiff (next friend) is entitled to represent the first plaintiff. Limitation Act, 1908 \u2013 Art. 142 \u2013 Requirements to bring a suit within purview of Art.142 \u2013 The suit must be for possession of immoveable property; the plaintiff must establish having been in possession of the property; and the plaintiff should have been dispossessed or must have discontinued possession while in possession of the property \u2013 For Art.142 to apply, these requirements must cumulatively be established. Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Suit filed by a worshipper for enforcement of his right to worship Lord Ram at the Janmabhumi \u2013 Maintainability of the suit, on death of the original plaintiff \u2013 Held: The pleadings indicate that the right asserted was not a private right, but a right in common with and for the benefit of other Hindu devotees to pray at the disputed property \u2013 The right claimed was that of the \u201cHindu public\u201d to worship at the disputed property without undue interference \u2013 The right asserted on behalf of the larger \u201cHindu public\u201d does not stand extinguished upon the death of the original plaintiff and can be pursued by his son who is also a worshipper. Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Doctrine of res judicata \u2013 Estoppel \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 An earlier suit filed in 1885 by one Mahant Raghubhar Das for permission to construct a temple on the Chabutra, had been dismissed \u2013 Whether the decision operated as res judicata and brought about a bar on filing of subsequent suits centering on the dispute, which gave rise to the appeals in question \u2013 Held: No merit in the contention \u2013 The parties were distinct \u2013 Claim in the earlier suit was distinct \u2013 Basis of the claim was not which formed the subject matter of subsequent suits \u2013 Similarly, no merit in submission based on doctrine of issue estoppel or estoppel by record. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Idol of Lord Ram \u2013 Deity \u2013 Shebaitship \u2013 Claim of Nirmohi Akhara as shebaits \u2013 Tenability \u2013 Held: A claim of rights as a de facto shebait must be substantiated with proof that person is in exclusive possession of the trust property and exercises complete control over the right of management of the properties without any let or hindrance from any quarters whatsoever \u2013 Though it cannot and has not been denied in the present proceedings that Nirmohi Akhara existed at the disputed site, the claim of Nirmohi Akhara, taken at the highest is that of an intermittent exercise of certain management rights \u2013 Their rights were peripheral, usually involving the assistance of pilgrims, and were constantly contested \u2013 A stray or intermittent exercise of management rights does not confer upon a claimant the position in law of a de facto shebait \u2013 It cannot be said that the acts of Nirmohi Akhara satisfy the legal standard of management and charge that is exclusive, uninterrupted and continuous over a sufficient period of time \u2013 Despite their undisputed presence at the disputed site, Nirmohi Akhara is not a shebait for the idols of Lord Ram at the disputed site. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Idol of Lord Ram \u2013 Deity \u2013 Shebait \u2013 Absence of lawfully recognised shebait \u2013 Effect \u2013 Held: In such a case, it is open for an interested worshipper to sue on behalf of the deity. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Hindu temple \u2013 Idol \u2013 Deity \u2013 Shebait \u2013 Distinction between shebait and pujari \u2013 Held: A shebait is vested with the authority to manage the properties of the deity and ensure the fulfilment of the purpose for which the property was dedicated \u2013 As a necessary adjunct of this managerial role, a shebait may hire pujaris for the performance of worship \u2013 This does not confer upon the appointed pujaris the status of a shebait \u2013 As appointees of the shebait, they are liable to be removed from office and cannot claim a right to continue in office. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Hindu temple \u2013 Debutter property \u2013 Shebait \u2013 de facto shebait and de jure shebait \u2013 Held: Where a person claims to be a shebait despite lack of a legal title, relevant enquiry before the Court is whether the person was in actual possession of the debutter property and was exercising all rights of a shebait \u2013 Paramount interest in protection of the debutter property underlines the recognition of a de facto shebait.  Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Hindu temple \u2013 Debutter property to Idol \u2013 Title \u2013 Independent claim of shebait \u2013 If tenable \u2013 Held: Though the shebait may have an interest in the usufruct of the debutter property, the de facto shebait is not vested with an independent right of title over the debutter property \u2013 Where a de facto shebait raises an independent claim to the debutter property to the idol, it assumes the position of a trespasser and no action at its behest is maintainable. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Hindu temple \u2013 Idol \u2013 Deity \u2013 Shebait acting adverse to interests of the deity \u2013 Suit by worshipper \u2013 Held: Where a shebait acts adverse to the interests of the deity, a worshipper can, as next friend of the deity, sue on behalf of the deity itself, provided that if the next friend\u2019s bona fides are contested, the court must scrutinise the intentions and capabilities of the next friend to adequately represent the deity \u2013 The court may do so of its own accord, ex debito justitae. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Deity \u2013 Juristic personality \u2013 Ayodhya matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Hindu idol \u2013 Juristic personality of the deity of Lord Ram (\u201cBhagwan Shri Ram Virajman\u201d) \u2013 Held: For devotees of Lord Ram, the deity is embodiment of Lord Ram and constitutes the resident deity of Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Oral and documentary evidence shows that Hindu devotees of Lord Ram hold a genuine, long standing and profound belief in the religious merit attained by offering prayer to Lord Ram at the site they believe to be his birth-place \u2013 Travel logs in the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century record prevalence of Hindu worship at the disputed site \u2013 Factum of Hindu belief in the sanctity of the disputed site established by evidence \u2013 The deity has been the object of worship for several hundred years and the underlying purpose of continued worship is apparent even absent any express dedication or trust \u2013 Existence of the idol is merely a question of form, or corpus, and legal personality of the deity \u201cBhagwan Sri Ram Virajman\u201d is not dependent on the continued existence of the idol \u2013 Jurisprudence \u2013 Juristic Personality.  Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Birth-place of deity \u2013 Juristic personality \u2013 Ayodhya matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Birth-place of Lord Ram \u2018Asthan Sri Ram Janam Bhumi\u2019 \u2013 Juristic personality \u2013 Held: Recognition of \u2018Asthan Sri Ram Janam Bhumi\u2019 as a juristic person would result in the extinguishment of all competing proprietary claims to the land in question \u2013 This conferral of \u2018absolute title\u2019 (resulting from the conferral of legal personality on land) would in truth render the very concept of title meaningless \u2013 Moreover, the extinguishing of competing claims would arise not by virtue of settled legal principles, but purely on the basis of the faith and belief of the devotees \u2013 This cannot be countenanced in law \u2013 Jurisprudence \u2013 Juristic Personality. Evidence \u2013 Title to land \u2013 Ayodhya matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Report of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) \u2013 Evidentiary value \u2013 Held: Title to the land must be decided on settled legal principles and applying evidentiary standards which govern a civil trial \u2013 A finding of title cannot be based in law on the archaeological findings arrived at by ASI \u2013 On facts, conclusion in the ASI report about remains of an underlying structure of Hindu religious origin, symbolic of temple architecture of the twelfth century A.D., must be read contextually with caveats. Evidence \u2013 Historical records \u2013 Travelogues \u2013 Gazetteers \u2013 Ayodhya matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi \u2013 Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Rival claims to possessory title \u2013 Historical records of travellers \u2013 Relevance of \u2013 Held: Accounts of the travellers must be read with circumspection \u2013 Their personal observations must carefully be sifted from hearsay \u2013 matters of legend and lore \u2013 Consulting their accounts on matters of public history is distinct from evidence on a matter of title \u2013 Contents of gazetteers can at best provide corroborative material to evidence which emerges from the record \u2013 The court must be circumspect in drawing negative inferences from what a traveller may not have seen or observed \u2013 Title cannot be established on the basis of faith and belief. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Ayodhya Matter \u2013 Ram Janmabhumi - Babri Masjid dispute \u2013 Birth-place of Lord Ram \u2013 Faith and belief of Hindu devotees \u2013 Whether the disputed structure is birth-place of Lord Ram according to the faith and belief of the Hindu devotees \u2013 Held (per addenda): Faith and belief of Hindus since prior to construction of Mosque and subsequent thereto has always been that Janmasthan of Lord Ram is the place where Babri Mosque has been constructed which faith and belief is proved by documentary and oral evidence. Acts of State \u2013 Change in sovereignty \u2013 Effect \u2013 Held: Municipal courts of the new sovereign will not enforce the legal rights of parties existing under the former sovereign absent an express or implied recognition by the new sovereign of such legal rights \u2013 Municipal courts of the new sovereign can embark upon an inquiry as to whether the new sovereign has expressly or impliedly recognised the rights and liabilities existing under a former regime \u2013 However, burden to establish the existence and recognition of such rights and liabilities remains on the party claiming them. Law and Justice \u2013 Historical rights and wrongs \u2013 Role of Court \u2013 Held: Courts of today cannot take cognisance of historical rights and wrongs unless it is shown that their legal consequences are enforceable in the present \u2013 The law cannot be used as a device to reach back in time and provide a legal remedy to every person who disagrees with the course which history has taken. Evidence \u2013 Civil Trial \u2013 Proof \u2013 Preponderance of probabilities \u2013 Held: Court in civil trials apply standard of proof governed by preponderance of probabilities \u2013 Proof of a fact depends upon probability of its existence \u2013 Findings of the court must be based on: (i) test of a prudent person, who acts under the supposition that a fact exists; and (ii) in the context and circumstances of a particular case. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Place of worship \u2013 Title or ownership of composite place of worship \u2013 Held: In absence of historical records with respect to ownership or title, the court has to determine the nature and use of the disputed premises as a whole by either of the parties \u2013 In determining the nature of use, the court has to factor in the length and extent of use. Religion / Religious structure \u2013 Mosque \u2013 Characteristics of mosque in Islamic law \u2013 Judicial review \u2013 Held: It would be inappropriate for Supreme Court to enter upon an area of theology and to assume the role of an interpreter of the \u201cHadees\u201d \u2013 True test is whether those who believe and worship have faith in religious efficacy of the place where they pray \u2013 Courts must steer clear from choosing one among the possible interpretations of theological doctrine and must accept the faith and belief of the worshipper \u2013 Any attempt to lead the court to interpret religious doctrine in an absolute and extreme form and question the faith of worshippers must be firmly rejected \u2013 Nothing would be as destructive of the values underlying Art.25 of the Constitution \u2013 Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art.25. Jurisprudence \u2013 Juristic personality \u2013 Conferral of \u2013 Effect \u2013 Held: It does not automatically grant an ensemble of legal rights \u2013 The contours of juristic personality i.e. the rights and liabilities that attach upon the object conferred with juristic personality, must be determined keeping in mind the specific reasons for which such legal personality was conferred. Jurisprudence \u2013 Juristic Personality \u2013 Idols \u2013 Hindu idol and divinity \u2013 Contours of legal personality ascribed to a Hindu idol \u2013 Held: Conferral of legal personality on a Hindu idol is not conferral of legal personality on divinity itself, which in Hinduism is often understood as the \u2018Supreme Being\u2019 \u2013 The Supreme Being has no physical presence for it is understood to be omnipresent \u2013 the very ground of being itself. Jurisprudence \u2013 Juristic Personality \u2013 Idols \u2013 Legal characteristics of Hindu idols and the properties associated with them \u2013 Held: To provide courts with a conceptual framework within which they could analyse and practically adjudicate upon disputes involving competing claims over endowed properties, courts recognised the legal personality of the Hindu idol \u2013 It was a legal innovation necessitated by historical circumstances, the gap in the existing law and by considerations of convenience \u2013 It had the added advantage of conferring legal personality on an object that within Hinduism had long been subject to personification \u2013 Legal personality of the idol, and the rights of the idol over the property endowed and the offerings of devotees, are guarded by the law to protect the endowment against maladministration by the human agencies entrusted with the day to day management of the idol. Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art. 142 \u2013 Scope under \u2013 Held: Supreme Court in exercise of its powers u/Art.142 must ensure that a wrong committed must be remedied \u2013 This power is not limitless \u2013 Power u/Art.142 authorises the court to pass orders to secure complete justice in the case before it \u2013 Art.142 embodies both the notion of justice, equity and good conscience as well as a supplementary power to the court to effect complete justice. Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art. 372 \u2013 Change of legal regime between British sovereign and the Republic of India \u2013 Line of continuity \u2013 Art. 372 embodies the legal continuity between the British sovereign and independent India. Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Equality \u2013 Rule of law \u2013 Held: Under the Constitution, citizens of all faiths, beliefs and creeds seeking divine provenance are both subject to the law and equal before the law \u2013 The Constitution does not make a distinction between the faith and belief of one religion and another \u2013 All forms of belief, worship and prayer are equal. Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Equality and Secularism \u2013 Held: The Constitution postulates the equality of all faiths \u2013 Tolerance and mutual co-existence nourish the secular commitment of our nation and its people. CrPC, 1898 \u2013 s.145 \u2013 Nature and scope of proceedings u/s.145 \u2013 Held: s.145 proceedings do not purport to decide a party\u2019s title or right to possession of the land \u2013 Property held in attachment in proceedings u/s.145 is \u2018custodia legis\u2019 \u2013 Provisions of s.145 can be invoked only when there is danger of breach of peace \u2013 Jurisdiction of Magistrate does not extend to adjudicate into disputed questions of title \u2013 Determination of the Magistrate is confined to which party was in actual possession on the date of the order \u2013 The real purpose is to decide who has actual physical possession and not legal possession supported by title over the land \u2013 To initiate proceedings u/s.145, the Magistrate has to be satisfied of the existence of a dispute which is likely to cause a breach of peace \u2013 Enquiry by the Magistrate is of a summary nature, the object being to ensure tranquillity in the locality when the dispute is likely to result in a breach of peace.  Property Law \u2013 Immovable property \u2013 Dispute \u2013 Title \u2013 Held: Court does not decide title on basis of faith or belief but on basis of evidence of ownership and possession.  statutory framework is inadequate for courts to adjudicate upon the dispute before them, or no settled judicial doctrine or custom can be availed of, or when parties are not governed by a particular personal law, or when the source of law requires to be supplemented, courts may legitimately take recourse to the principles of justice, equity and good conscience to effectively and fairly dispose of the case. Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Doctrine of lost grant \u2013 Applicability \u2013 Held: The doctrine supplies a rule of evidence and is applicable in the absence of evidence, due to lapse of time, to prove the existence of a valid grant issued in antiquity \u2013 However, the court is not bound to raise the presumption where there is sufficient and convincing evidence to prove possession or when there are no defined grantees \u2013 There must be long, uninterrupted and peaceful enjoyment of an incorporeal right \u2013 The doctrine of lost grant is different from assertion of rights due to a prolonged custom \u2013 Alternate plea of adverse possession is destructive of a valid legal basis to apply the doctrine of lost grant as a rule of evidence \u2013 Evidence. Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Doctrine of lost grant \u2013 Effect of alternate plea of adverse possession \u2013 Held: Adverse possession postulates the vesting of title in one person and the existence of a long continued and uninterrupted possession of another, to the knowledge of and in a manner hostile to, the true title holder \u2013 Plea of adverse possession would lead to an inference against the application of the doctrine of lost grant as a plea of adverse possession is premised in title vesting in someone other than the alleged grantee \u2013 A person who sets up a plea of adverse possession must establish both possession which is peaceful, open and continuous \u2013 possession which meets the requirement of being \u2018nec vi nec claim and nec precario\u2019 \u2013 To substantiate a plea of adverse possession, the character of the possession must be adequate in continuity and in the public because the possession has to be to the knowledge of the true owner in order for it to be adverse \u2013 These requirements have to be duly established first by adequate pleadings and second by leading sufficient evidence \u2013 Possession \u2013 Adverse Possession \u2013 Evidence.  Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.110 \u2013 Applicability \u2013 Held: s.110 is based on the principle that possession in itself may raise a presumption of title \u2013 But this applies when the facts disclose no title in either of the disputants, in which case, possession alone decides \u2013 Presumption cannot arise when the facts are known \u2013 Possession. Waqf \u2013 Waqf by user \u2013 Principles \u2013 Express declaration of Waqf, if necessary \u2013 Held: Muslim law does not require an express declaration of a Waqf in every case \u2013 Dedication resulting in a waqf may also be reasonably inferred from the facts and circumstances of a case or from conduct of the wakif \u2013 Doctrine of waqf by user is a doctrine of necessity \u2013 The law recognises that where, since time immemorial, worship has been offered at a land with a mosque, the land is presumed to have been dedicated for a religious purpose and even absent a dedication, is waqf by user \u2013 However, this may not be extended to the extinguishment of competing and established religious rights of another community in the same property particular in the face of the evidence \u2013 Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 s.3(r) \u2013 Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Doctrine of \u201cwaqf by user\u201d \u2013 Muslim Law. Evidence \u2013 Pleadings \u2013 Effect of inadequate pleadings \u2013 Held: Evidence can only be adduced with reference to matters which are pleaded in a civil suit and in the absence of an adequate pleadings, evidence by itself cannot supply the deficiency of a pleaded case.  Words and Phrases \u2013 \u201clegal person\u201d \u2013 Meaning \u2013 Held: To be a legal person is to possess certain rights and duties under the law and to be capable of engaging in legally enforceable relationships with other legal persons \u2013 Who or what is a legal person is a function of the legal system \u2013 Jurisprudence.

Attestation by the two witnesses and itsexecution in the manner contemplated by cl (c) to s.63 of the IndianSuccession Act \u2013 However, where one attesting witness examinedfails to prove due execution of the will, then other available attestingwitness must be called to supplement his evidence to make itcomplete in all respects to comply with the requirement of proof asmandated by s. 68 of the Evidence Act \u2013 The effect of s. 71 EvidenceAct can be requisitioned when the attesting witnesses who were beingcalled have failed to prove the execution of Will by reason of eitherdenying their own signatures, denying the signature of the testatoror due to bad recollection as to the execution of the document \u2013s.71 has no application when only one attesting witness who wascalled and examined has failed to prove the execution of Will andthe other available attesting witness was not summoned."

State of Rajasthan and thereafter inManmohan Sharma v. State of Rajasthan and Others case has causedthis annoying and festering litigation to prolong since 1999, that incourse of time has become so complicated that no man knows whatit means.Res judicata \u2013 Doctrine of res judicata and law of precedent \u2013Difference between \u2013 Held: Res judicata operates in personam i.e.the matter in issue between the same parties in the former litigation,while law of precedent operates in rem i.e. the law once settled isbinding on all under the jurisdiction of the High Court and theSupreme Court \u2013 Res judicata binds the parties to the proceedingsfor the reason that there should be an end to the litigation andtherefore, subsequent proceeding inter-se parties to the litigation isbarred \u2013 Therefore, law of res judicata concerns the same matter,while law of precedent concerns application of law in a similarissue \u2013 In res judicata, the correctness of the decision is normallyimmaterial and it does not matter whether the previous decisionwas right or wrong, unless the erroneous determination relates tothe jurisdictional matter of that body \u2013 Precedents \u2013 Doctrines /Principles.Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art. 141 \u2013 Binding precedent \u2013Appointment \u2013 To post of Primary School teachers in Zila Parishadsof various districts of the State of Rajasthan \u2013 Award of bonusmarks on basis of domicile to candidates seeking such appointments Challenged \u2013 Declared unconst itutional by Full Bench ofRajasthan High Court by decision dated 18-11-1999 in writproceedings \u2013 Supreme Court affirmed the decision in Kailash ChandSharma case, however, by applying the doctrine of prospectiveoverruling, it protected appointments made on or before 17-11-1999and confined relief only to those writ petitioners who had movedthe High Court before 18-11-1999 \u2013 However, in several subsequentdecisions of Rajasthan High Court, reliefs were granted to writpetitioners who had not filed writ petition before the cut-off date of18-11-1999 fixed in Kailash Chand Sharma\u2019s case \u2013 Some of thesedecisions were made even after the decision of Manmohan Sharma\u2019scase on 01-04-2014 wherein the Supreme Court declined to enlargethe scope of directions issued in Kailash Chand Sharma\u2019s case \u2013Held: Authoritative pronouncements of the Supreme Court and HighCourt must be respected and followed as any departure therefromwould cause uncertainty, unnecessary and speculative litigation \u2013Directions given by Supreme Court in Kailash Chand Sharma\u2019s casewere a binding precedent u/Art.141 which was affirmed andelucidated by Supreme Court in Manmohan Sharma\u2019s case \u2013Consequently, candidates who had not filed writ petitions on orbefore 17-11-1999 would not be entitled to appointment uponrecalculation of marks by exclusion of bonus marks from the marksof the selected candidates \u2013 Such direction however would not applyto individual cases where decisions of High Court though contraryto the ratio in Kailash Chand Sharma case had attained finality andthus would operate as res judicata \u2013 Service Law \u2013 Appointment.Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Doctrine of prospective overruling \u2013Invocation of \u2013 Held: Doctrine of prospective overruling can beinvoked for balancing of competing claims \u2013 Supreme Court inKailash Chand Sharma v. State of Rajasthan case while affirming thefindings of a Full Bench decision of Rajasthan High Court dated18-11-1999 held that award of bonus marks on basis of domicile tocandidates seeking appointment (as primary school teachers in ZilaParishads in the State of Rajasthan) amounted to impermissiblediscrimination \u2013 However, keeping in view the factual matrix of thecase, the Supreme Court felt that there was a need to balancecompeting claims and thus partially applied the doctrine ofprospective overruling whereby notwithstanding the ratio,appointments made before 18-11-1999 were left untouched and saved \u2013 Ratio and direction invoking doctrine of prospectiveoverruling, applied in Kailash Chand Sharma\u2019s case was affirmedand elucidated by Supreme Court in Manmohan Sharma\u2019s case \u2013Accordingly, all pending matters before High Court, to be decidedon basis of decisions in Kailash Chandra Sharma\u2019s and ManmohanSharma\u2019s cases and the instant cases, subject to condonation ofdelay, when justified and satisfactorily explained \u2013 Service Law \u2013Appointment"

(for Rohinton F. Nariman, J. and himself) \u2013 Minority judgmentupholding conviction but awarding life sentence (till natural death)without remission / commutation delivered by Sanjiv Khanna, J. \u2013Review Petitions \u2013 Held: Liable to be dismissed \u2013 Per Surya Kant,J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself), held: Prosecution case wasestablished through numerous evidences in addition to a clearconfession proving petitioner\u2019s guilt beyond any residual doubt \u2013Conflicting versions were deposed by petitioner and defencewitnesses, and no explanation to discharge onus u/s.106 of theEvidence Act was provided \u2013 Hence, it was not a case fit forapplication of theory of \u201cresidual doubt\u201d \u2013 Just because the nowdeceased co-accused was the mastermind whose offence was comparatively more egregious, one cannot commute the otherwisebarbarically shocking offences of the petitioner \u2013 Also, attemptedretraction of confession by the petitioner showed how he was infact remorseless \u2013 It was not in the spur of the moment or a crime ofpassion; but craftily planned, meticulously executed and withmultiple opportunities to cease and desist \u2013 Offences of petitionerwere so grave as to shock the conscience of the Court and of societyand amounted to the rarest of the rare \u2013 No grounds to reviewjudgment upholding his conviction and death penalty \u2013 Per SanjivKhanna, J., held: Reasons given by Surya Kant, J. in dismissing thereview petition and upholding the conviction of petitioner are entirelyagreed upon and concurred with \u2013 On the question of sentence, nogood ground and reasons to review the observations and findingsin the minority judgment \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss. 302, 376(2)(f),(g) & 201 \u2013 CrPC, 1973 \u2013 ss.163, 164 \u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.24and 106.Review \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held [per Surya Kant, J. (for R.F.Nariman, J. and himself)]: Scope of a review is more constrainedthan that of an appeal \u2013 A party cannot be allowed to re-urge thecase on merits to effectively seek re-appreciation of evidence whenthe matter has already been decided earlier, even if on differentgrounds \u2013 Interference in the earlier judgement assailed in a Reviewis permissible only on the basis of an error apparent on the face ofrecord or discovery of important new evidence which has a directbearing on the ultimate outcome of the case and if not wellappreciated, would cause manifest injustice.Precedents \u2013 Verdicts with multiple opinions \u2013 Interpretationof \u2013 Dissenting opinions \u2013 Precedential value of \u2013 Held [per SuryaKant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]: Dissenting opinionshave little precedential value and there is no difference in operationbetween decisions rendered unanimously or those tendered bymajority, albeit with minority dissenting views \u2013 Jurisprudence.Confession \u2013 Validity \u2013 Voluntariness of a confession \u2013 Held[per Surya Kant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]: Cornerstoneof a valid confession in India is only whether such a statement wasmade in compliance with statutory provisions which mandate thatthe same must be before the Magistrate after compliance with certainsafeguards meant to ensure voluntariness and lack of coercion by the police \u2013 On facts, the Magistrate (PW-28) duly complied withall procedural requirements for recording of a confessional statementand affirmatively satisfied himself of the voluntariness of thepetitioner\u2019s confession \u2013 CrPC, 1973 \u2013 ss.163, 164 \u2013 Evidence Act,1872 \u2013 s.24.Confession \u2013 Retracted confession \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held [perSurya Kant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]:: Even in theabsence of an express provision for retracting a confessionarystatement once made, the Courts have preferred a rule of prudencewhereby in case of retraction, the Court reduces the probative valueof such confessionary statements and seeks corroborating evidence\u2013 CrPC, 1973 \u2013 ss.163, 164 \u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 24.Confession \u2013 Objective and use of \u2013 Held [per Surya Kant,J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]: Provisions permitting use ofconfessionary statements in criminal trials were statutorily includedas an acknowledgement of the possibi lity that in certaincircumstances an accused may voluntarily confess to his offence(s).Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death penalty \u2013 Plea that death oughtnot to be awarded in cases of circumstantial evidence \u2013 Held [perSurya Kant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]: Not tenable \u2013There can be no hard rule of not awarding death in cases based oncircumstantial evidence \u2013 Criminal Law.Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death penalty cases \u2013 Opportunityfor oral arguments on the question of sentence \u2013 Held [per SuryaKant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]: In cases of death penalty,since the punishment is irreversible and right to life u/Art.21 of theconvict is violated, it is necessary to provide at least one opportunityfor oral arguments on the question of sentence \u2013 Constitution ofIndia, 1950 \u2013 Art. 21.Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death penalty \u2013 Grounds forcommutation \u2013 Held [per Surya Kant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. andhimself)]: Even observed devoid of any aggravating circumstances,mere young age and presence of aged parents cannot be groundsfor commutation \u2013 One may view that such young age poses acontinuous burden on the State and presents a longer risk to society,hence warranting more serious intervention by Courts. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.164 \u2013 Defence plearegarding absence of a counsel during proceedings before theMagistrate u/s.164, CrPC resulting into prejudice \u2013 Held [per SuryaKant, J. (for R.F. Nariman, J. and himself)]: The plea is misconceived\u2013 s.164 CrPC does not contemplate that a confession or statementshould necessarily be made in the presence of the advocate(s),except, when such confessional statement is recorded with audiovideoelectronic means."
