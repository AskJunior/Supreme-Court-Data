Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 \u2013 s.25(H) \u2013 Termination from service \u2013 Respondent working as peon in the appellant-society \u2013 Terminated from services in 1985 \u2013 Labour court held the termination as bad in law and awarded lump sum compensation of Rs.12500 to the respondent in lieu of reinstatement in service \u2013 Writ petitions by both the parties were dismissed by High Court \u2013 Thereafter, respondent accepted the compensation which was awarded by labour court \u2013 In 1993, respondent prayed for re- employment in the appellant\u2019s services in terms of s.25(H) in view of regularization of services of two peons in that year \u2013 Entitlement of respondent to claim re-employment \u2013 Held: There was no case made out by the respondent (workman) seeking re-employment in the appellant\u2019s services on the basis of s.25(H) \u2013 Respondent having accepted the compensation awarded to him in lieu of his right of reinstatement in service, the said issue finally came to an end \u2013 Moreover, s.25 (H) had no application to the case at hand \u2013 In order to attract the provisions of s.25(H), the workman has to prove that he was the \u201cretrenched employee\u201d and that his ex-employer has decided to fill up the vacancies in their set up and, therefore, he is entitled to claim preference over those persons, who have  applied against such vacancies for a job while seeking re- employment in the services \u2013 This was, therefore, not a case of a retrenchment of the respondent from service as contemplated under s.25(H) of the ID Act. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 \u2013 s.25(H) \u2013 Regularization and employment \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Held: The expression \u2018employment\u2019 signifies a fresh employment to fill the vacancies whereas the expression \u2018regularization of the service\u2019 signifies that services of the employee, who is already in service are regularized as per service regulations.

CBI \u2013 Role of CBI \u2013 Investigation of anti-corruption cases; economic offences and ordinary crimes of special importance have come to be vested in the CBI which exercises its jurisdiction in the territory of all States and Union Territory with consent of State Governments. Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 \u2013 s.4A and s.4B \u2013 Legislative intent of \u2013 Held: The clear legislative intent in bringing s.4A and s.4B to the statute book is for the purpose of ensuring complete insulation of the office of the Director, CBI from all kinds of extraneous influences, as may be, as well as for upholding the integrity and independence of the institution of the CBI as a whole \u2013 If the legislative intent would have been to confer in any authority of the State a power to take interim measures against the Director, CBI thereby affecting his functioning, surely, the legislation would have contained enabling provisions to that effect and consequently would have been differently worded and drafted \u2013 Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003 "

Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Act, 2016 \u2013 s.6(4) \u2013 Forbidding grant of licence for discotheque or orchestra where licence under this Act is granted \u2013 Whether s.6(4) is violative of equality clause enshrined in Art.19(1) of the Constitution \u2013 Held: s.6(4) forbids grant of licence for discotheque or orchestra where licence under this Act is granted \u2013 Conversely it also forbids grant of licence under this Act for the place for which a licence for discotheque or orchestra has been granted \u2013 It means that in respect of a particular place, a licence would be granted either for dance bars or for discotheque/orchestra and not for both purposes \u2013 The impugned provision is totally arbitrary and irrational and has no nexus with the so-called purpose sought to be achieved \u2013 s.6(4) of the Act is struck as unconstitutional \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19(1). Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Act, 2016 \u2013 s.8(2) \u2013 Whether punishment provided under s.8(2) of the Act is discriminatory and offends Art.14 of the Constitution \u2013 Held: Sub-section (2) has to be read along with sub- section (1) of s.8 \u2013 Under s.8(1), if the place is used in contravention of s.3, it is made a punishable offence \u2013 It means that where a hotel, restaurant, bar room or any place is used for staging dances without obtaining a licence under s.3 of the Act, that is made a punishable offence \u2013 However, even if licence is obtained, that would not mean that place can be used for obscene dance performances or for exploiting working women for any immoral purpose \u2013 It is these acts which are made punishable under sub-section (2) \u2013 In this manner, the offence under s.8(2) is somewhat different from the offence that is stipulated in s.294 IPC \u2013 Challenge to the validity of s.8(2) of the Act, therefore, failed \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14. Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Act, 2016 \u2013 s.8(4) \u2013 Whether s.8(4) of the Act is arbitrary and violative of Art.14 \u2013 This provision is to be read with condition Nos. 6, 7 and 8 of Part B \u2013 It banned throwing or showering coins, currency notes or any article or anything which can be monetized on the stage or handing over personally such notes, to a dancer and treated it as an offence \u2013 Further stipulation in these provisions is that any tip to be given should be added in the bill only and is not to be given to the performers etc. \u2013 The justification given by the State was that showering of money etc. is a method of inducement which has to be curbed keeping in view that Act aims to protect the dignity of women \u2013 Held: Insofar as throwing or showering coins, currency notes etc. is concerned, the provision is well justified as it aims at checking any untoward incident since the said Act has tendency to create a situation of indecency \u2013 Therefore, whatever money, any appreciation of any dance performance, has to be given, can be done without throwing or showering such coins etc. \u2013 However, there may not be any justification in giving such tips only by adding thereto in the bills to be raised by the administration of the place \u2013 On the contrary, if that is done, the person who is rightful recipient of such tips may be denied the same \u2013 Further, State cannot impose a particular manner of tipping as it is entirely a matter between an employer and performer on the one hand, and the performer and the visitor on the other hand \u2013 Therefore, the provision is upheld insofar as it prohibits throwing or showering of coins, currency notes or any article or anything which can be monetised on the stage \u2013 However, handing over of the notes to the dancers personally is not inappropriate \u2013 The provision of giving the tips only by adding the same in the bills is also set aside \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14. Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 r.3(3)(i) \u2013 Legality of, challenged on the ground that it is vague \u2013 As per this sub-rule, a person is entitled to obtain or hold licence who possesses a \u2018good character\u2019 and \u2018antecedents\u2019 and he should not have any history of \u2018criminal record\u2019 in the past ten years \u2013 Held: The terms \u2018good character\u2019 or \u2018antecedents\u2019 or \u2018criminal record\u2019 are not definite or precise \u2013 These expressions are capable of any interpretation and, therefore, is left to the wisdom of the licensing authority to adjudge whether a particular person possesses good character or good antecedents or not \u2013 Likewise, insofar as history of criminal record is concerned, it is not spelled out as to whether such a criminal record is based on conviction in a case or mere lodging of FIR would be termed as criminal record \u2013 Therefore, the provision is quashed in the present form, but, at the same time, liberty is given to the rule making authority to have suitable provision of precise nature \u2013 Consequently, condition No. 16 of Part B in the present form is also set aside. Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 Condition No. 2 of Part A of general conditions (GOC) \u2013 Stage in bar room has to be with non-transparent partition between hotel, restaurant and bar room area \u2013 In essence, it segregates bar room area from hotel and restaurant i.e. it prescribes fixed partition between permit room and dance room \u2013 Justification of \u2013 Held: There is no rationality in imposing such a condition having regard to any objective sought to be achieved \u2013 Therefore, this provision is struck down. Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 Condition No.11 of Part A \u2013 Stipulation that the place where dance is to be performed should be at least 1 km away from the educational and religious institutions \u2013 Held: Such a condition does not take into account the ground realities particularly in the city of Mumbai where it is difficult to find any place which is 1 km away from either an education institution or a religious institution \u2013 This, therefore, amounts to fulfilling an impossible condition and the effect thereof is that, at no place, in Mumbai, licence would be granted \u2013 Therefore, this condition is also arbitrary and unreasonable and is quashed, with liberty to the respondents to prescribe the distance from educational and religious institutions, which is reasonable and workable. Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 Condition No.2 of Part B \u2013 Imposition of an obligation on the employers to the effect that working women, the dancers and waiters/waitresses must be employed under a written contract on a monthly salary and their monthly salary should be deposited in their bank accounts with all the benefits required under the law and copy of such contracts should be deposited with the licensing authority as well \u2013 Held: The provision relating to entering into a written contract as well as depositing of the remuneration in the bank accounts is justified as it make the conditions on which such working women, dancers and waiters/waitresses are employed, transparent thereby eliminating or minimising any chances of exploitation or other disputes \u2013 However, the condition of employing such persons on monthly salary impinges upon the rights of such workers as well who may, otherwise, be free to give their performances at more than one place \u2013 This imposes condition of employment in a particular manner i.e. on monthly basis \u2013 There can be other modes of employment permissible in law and the employers have legal right to adopt such modes \u2013 Therefore, it imposes restriction even upon such employees and infringes their right under Art.19(1)(g) \u2013 The State Government failed to show any compelling public interest to curtail the choices of women performers \u2013 This part of Condition No. 2 is set aside \u2013 However, the provisions for written contract, deposit of the remuneration in the bank accounts of the employee as well as submission of these written contracts with the licensing authority are appropriate \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19(1)(g). Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 Condition No. 9 of Part B \u2013 Prescribing timing of dance performances only between 6 pm to 11:30 pm \u2013 Held: It is not manifestly unreasonable \u2013 Merely because establishments are otherwise open until 1:30 am (next day) or 12:30 am (next day) does not mean that the State has no power to restrict the time of dance performances till 11:30 pm. \u2013 Even a period of 6 pm to 11:30 pm for dance performances is quite sufficient and substantial as it allows 5\u00bd hours of such performances \u2013 This condition is upheld. Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 Condition No. 12 of Part B \u2013 Prescribing that no alcohol should be served in the bar room where dances are staged \u2013 Held: This is totally disproportionate, unreasonable and arbitrary \u2013 There is no reason as to why the liquor cannot be served at such places \u2013 State seemingly is more influenced by moralistic overtones under wrong presumption that persons after consuming alcohol would misbehave with the dancers \u2013 If this is so, such a presumption would be equally applicable to bar rooms where the alcohol is served by women waitresses \u2013 However, such conditions have been held to be unreasonable by the Courts \u2013 There may be aberrations or sporadic incidents of this nature which can happen not only at the places where dance performances are staged but at other places including bar rooms and even main restaurants \u2013 Other measures have to be adopted to check such a nuance \u2013 There cannot be a complete prohibition from serving alcoholic beverages \u2013 Therefore, condition No. 12 is quashed.  Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Rules, 2016 \u2013 Condition No. 20 of Part B \u2013 Installing of CCTV Cameras \u2013 This would be totally inappropriate and amounts to invasion of privacy and is, thus, violative of Arts.14, 19(1)(a) and 21 of the Constitution \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 19(1)(a) and 21. Morality \u2013 Extent to which the State can go in imposing morality on its citizens \u2013 Held: It cannot be denied that dance performances, in dignified forms, are socially acceptable and nobody takes exceptions to the same \u2013 On the other hand, obscenity is treated as immoral \u2013 Therefore, obscene dance performance may not be acceptable and the State can pass a law prohibiting obscene dances \u2013 However, a practice which may not be immoral by societal standards cannot be thrusted upon the society as immoral by the State with its own notion of morality and thereby exercise \u2018social control\u2019.

Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 \u2013 Whether the Act, 1993 can be said to have retrospective operation \u2013 Held: The Act is not retrospective \u2013 The liability of buyer to make payment and day from which payment and interest become payable under ss.3 and 4 does not relate on any event which took place prior to Act, 1993 and, therefore, it is not even necessary to say that Act, 1993 is retroactive in operation \u2013 The Act, 1993 is clearly prospective in operation \u2013 Retroactive effect.  Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 \u2013 s.10 \u2013 Limitation \u2013 The provision of s.10 of 1993 Act gives overriding effect to \u201cthe provisions of Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent herewith contained in any other law for the time being in force\u201d \u2013 However, since there is no provision in 1993 Act pertaining to limitation, the provision of Limitation Act pertaining to filing suit shall continue to operate, there being nothing contrary or overriding under 1993 Act \u2013 Limitation Act, 1963 is fully applicable with regard to money suit filed by the appellant hence, the question of limitation has to be answered as per Limitation Act 1963 \u2013 The limitation for suit for recovery of interest under 1993 Act is a suit of nature which shall be covered by Part X Art.113 of the Schedule \u2013 Limitation Act 1963 \u2013 Part X Art.113 of the Schedule \u2013 Non-obstante clause. Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 \u2013 s.2(d) \u2013 Interest \u2013 Date from when payable \u2013 Held: Payment shall become due from the appointed day \u2013 Appointed day is defined in s.2(d) to be \u201cthe day following immediately after the expiry of period of 30 days from the date of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance of any goods or any service from any buyer or supplier\u201d \u2013 In the instant case, last supply was completed on 4.10.1993 \u2013 Thus, appointed day would be 4.11.1993 \u2013 Thus when the payment was not made on 4.11.1993 with regard to amount due, i.e. the interest as per s.4, the limitation for filing the suit will start running \u2013 Art.113 provides for \u201ctime from which period begins as when the right to sue accrues\u201d \u2013 s.4 creates statutory liability to pay interest from the day as mentioned in s.4 \u2013 The amount become due as soon as liability to pay arises \u2013 s.6 also uses the word \u201camount due from buyer\u201d \u2013 Thus the fact that last payment was made on 5.3.1994 cannot be treated as period for beginning of the limitation and on that ground it cannot be held that suit was within time \u2013 Thus, benefit of s.14 cannot be claimed by the plaintiff in the facts of the instant case \u2013 Suit filed by the plaintiff was clearly barred by time. Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 \u2013 Suit for recovery of only interest when admittedly entire principal amount was paid prior to filing of the suit \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 Held: Maintainable \u2013 s.6 of the 1993 Act provides that \u201cthe amount due from the buyer, together with amount of interest calculated in accordance with provision of ss.4 and 5 shall be recoverable\u201d \u2013 s.6 uses the expression \u201ctogether with the amount of interest with the amount due from the buyer\u201d \u2013 The interpretation that proceeding for recovery of interest can be undertaken only when any amount is due, if accepted then buyer will very easily get away from payment of interest only after making payment of Principal amount \u2013 This interpretation shall defeat very purposes of 1993 Act \u2013 It is well settled that provisions of Act has to be interpreted in the manner so as to advance the object of the Act \u2013 Interpretation of statutes. Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1993 \u2013 Whether the High Court while considering the review petition even after expressing that Act, 1993 is not applicable could have allowed 9% interest to the plaintiff for the period of delayed payment\u2013 Held: Even if Act 1993 is not applicable, the Court can very well exercise its jurisdiction to award interest \u2013 High Court did not commit any error in awarding 9% interest to plaintiff \u2013 Review. Appeal \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 Review \u2013 Held: When liberty to file review was obtained on a ground, the review judgment can be questioned on the ground on which the review was permitted \u2013 In other words, the ground on which the appellant can challenge the review judgment can be the ground on which liberty was obtained to file review.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 Whether by virtue of s.12 of the Amendment Act, the Managing Director of the appellant-Corporation became ineligible to act \u2013 Held: After the amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 2015, s.12(5) prohibited the employee of one of the parties from being an arbitrator \u2013 In the instant case, the agreement between the parties was entered into on 28.01.2000 and the arbitration proceedings commenced way back in 2009 and thus, the respondent cannot invoke s.12(5) of the Amendment Act, 2015 \u2013 As per s.26 of the Act, the provisions of the amended Act 2015 shall not apply to the arbitral proceedings commenced in accordance with the provisions of s.21 of the principal Act, before the commencement of this Act unless the parties otherwise agree \u2013 There was nothing to suggest that the parties had agreed that the provisions of the new Act shall apply in relation to the arbitral proceedings \u2013 The arbitration proceedings started way back in 2009 long before 2015 Amendment Act came into force and, therefore, 2015 Amendment Act is not applicable to the case in hand \u2013 The statutory provisions that would govern the matter are those which were then in force before the Amendment Act \u2013 Therefore, Managing Director was not ineligible to act as sole arbitrator \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 \u2013 s.12. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.15 \u2013 Delay in passing award \u2013 Termination of mandate and substitution of an arbitrator \u2013 Mere neglect of an arbitrator to act or delay in passing the award by itself cannot be the ground to appoint another arbitrator in deviation from the terms agreed to by the parties \u2013 s.15 dealt with termination of the mandate and substitution of an arbitrator \u2013 As per sub-section (1) of s.15, in addition to the circumstances referred to in ss.13 and 14 of the Act, the mandate of an arbitrator shall terminate where he withdraws from office for any reason or by or pursuant to the agreement of the parties \u2013 In terms of sub-section (2), after termination of arbitrator\u2019s mandate, the appointment of the substitute arbitrator would be in accordance with the rules applicable to the appointment of an arbitrator who is being replaced \u2013 s.11(6) of the Act would come into play only when there was failure on the part of the party concerned to appoint an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement \u2013 In the instant case, the High Court was not right in appointing an independent arbitrator without keeping in view the terms of the agreement between the parties and therefore, the impugned order appointing an independent arbitrator/retired District Judge was not sustainable. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.15 \u2013 Remedy to the Respondent-Contractor \u2013 Arbitral Tribunal did not make progress in the arbitration matter \u2013 As per the arbitral proceedings, the chronological events were required to be ascertained and reconstruction was required \u2013 Respondent filed application for appointment of independent arbitrator \u2013 The fact of arbitration application was brought to the notice of Arbitral Tribunal \u2013 Respondent prayed for keeping the arbitration proceedings in abeyance \u2013 On the basis of available materials, the Arbitral Tribunal passed the final award on 21.01.2016 \u2013 Whether the award was sustainable \u2013 Held: Since the High Court was in seisin of the matter, the Arbitral Tribunal could have given further opportunity to the respondent to put forth his case \u2013 The proceedings of the Arbitral Tribunal was pending for quite some time from 2009 till 2015 and after the respondent approached the High Court in May, 2015, the arbitrator hurriedly passed the award \u2013 Respondent was repeatedly praying for adjournment and was not present on the date of passing of the final award \u2013 It was noted in the proceedings dated 17.08.2011 that the chronological events needed to be ascertained and reconstruction was required \u2013 It is not known whether the same was ascertained or not and whether reconstruction was done before passing the final award on 21.01.2016 \u2013 Respondent made number of claims under various heads \u2013 Respondent ought to have been given an opportunity to substantiate its claim under various heads \u2013 Therefore, in order to do complete justice between the parties and in exercise of powers under Art.142 of the Constitution of India, award dated 21.01.2016 is to be set aside \u2013 The present Managing Director of the appellant would be the sole arbitrator and the Managing Director is directed to take up the matter and continue the proceedings and afford sufficient opportunity to both the parties to adduce further evidence and to make oral submissions and pass the final award within a period of four months \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.142. Constitution of India \u2013 Art.142 \u2013 Scope of \u2013 In exercise of power under Art.142, it is open to the court to mould the relief by safeguarding the interest of parties \u2013 The paramount consideration in such cases should be to ensure that there is no injustice caused \u2013 The phrase \u201ccomplete justice\u201d engrafted in Art.142(1) is the word of width couched with elasticity to meet myriad situations created by human ingenuity or cause or result of operation of Statute law or law declared under Arts.32, 136 and 141 of the Constitution \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 \u2013 Condition of 40%-50% disability for partially blind and partially deaf categories of disabled persons in a notification for recruitment of Civil Judges (Junior Division) issued by the Public Service Commission \u2013 Validity of \u2013 Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPC) issued notification for the 162 posts of Civil Judge (Junior Division) and announced 40%-50% disability for partially blind and partially deaf categories of disabled persons \u2013 Held: Judicial Service being part of Public Service, the State in consultation with the High court is fully empowered to lay down the eligibilities for selection on the post of Civil Judge (Junior Division) \u2013 The condition of having 40%-50% disability was prescribed by the Public Service Commission as per the Government Order issued by the State after consultation with the High Court \u2013 There was consensus in the view of State Government, Public Service Commission and the High Court that partially blind and partially deaf persons suffering with disability be allowed to participate in the recruitment, who has disability of 40%-50% \u2013 Thus, condition of 40%-50% disability for partially blind and partially deaf categories of disabled persons cannot be said to be invalid \u2013 Tamil Nadu State Judicial Service (Cadre and Recruitment) Rules, 2007.  Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 \u2013 s.33 \u2013 Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPC) issued notification for 162 posts of Civil Judge (Junior Division) and announced 40%-50% disability for partially blind and partially deaf for the selection in question \u2013 Appellant contended that Act, 1995 does not provide for any such restriction that the eligibility is of only those who suffer from disability of 40%-50% \u2013 Held: s.33 of the Act, 1995 requires that every appropriate Government shall appoint in every establishment such percentage of vacancies not less than three percent for persons or class of persons with disability of which one percent each shall be reserved for persons suffering from blindness or low vision \u2013 The present is not a case where the respondent has not reserved the post for partial disability as required by s.33 of the Act, 1995 \u2013 Thus, requirement of reservation as mandated by s.33 is clearly fulfilled \u2013 The State, which is appointing authority of Public Service in consultation with the High Court with reference to post of Civil Judge (Junior Division) can very well lay down the essential eligibilities and requirement for the post \u2013 When the State, High Court and Public Service Commission are of the view that disability, which is suitable for appointment on the post of Civil Judge should be between 40%-50%, the said prescription does not violate any statutory provision nor contravene any of the provisions of the Act, 1995 \u2013 It is well within the power of appointing authority to prescribe eligibility looking to the nature of the job, which is to be performed by holder of a post. Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 154, 233, 234, 235 and Entry 41 List II of the Seventh Schedule \u2013 State Government, if competent to take any executive decision with regard to recruitment on the post of Civil Judge (Junior Division) \u2013 Held: Judicial Service being Public service is included in Entry 41 List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution \u2013 State having competence to legislate on Entry 41, i.e. State public Services; State Public Service Commission, it has also executive power under Art. 154 of the Constitution of India \u2013 Thus, the State Government is fully competent to take any executive decision with regard to recruitment on the post of Civil Judge (Junior Division), supplementing the Statutory Rules, 2007 \u2013 Tamil Nadu State Judicial Service (Cadre and Recruitment) Rules, 2007.

Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 \u2013 s.59 \u2013 Improvement scheme \u2013 Abhyankar Road Widening and Buty Mahal Street Scheme was framed under Nagpur Improvement Trust Act in the year 1960 for creating improved means of communications and facilities for traffic \u2013 The scheme provided for 15 metre internal road \u2013 However, the Development Plans made under the MRTP Act which came into effect on 11.1.1967 did not provide for 15 metre internal road \u2013 NIT decided to implement the scheme \u2013 State Government allotted reconstituted composite plot to the land owners \u2013 Pursuant thereto, the process of widening of Abhyankar Road was initiated and notices were issued for demolition of shops \u2013 Writ petitions filed for quashing of the notices \u2013 High Court quashed the notices of demolition \u2013 High Court also observed that as in the Scheme sanctioned under s.45 of the NIT Act, 15 metre internal road is provided, unless the same is varied and/or modified under s.46 of the NIT Act by the Planning Authority, the same shall have to be implemented \u2013 On appeal, held: The Development Plan made under the MRTP Act would take precedence over any Scheme to the contrary \u2013 s.59 of the MRTP Act provides for preparation of the Scheme under the MRTP Act, which specifically provides that the Planning Authority may prepare one or more Town Planning Scheme for the area within its jurisdiction or any part thereof for the purpose of implementing the proposals in the Final Development Plan \u2013 Conjoint reading of ss.39, 43, 46 and s.59 of the MRTP Act showed that the Development Plans prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act shall prevail \u2013 Therefore, there cannot be any development and/or construction permitted contrary to the Development Plan prepared and sanctioned under the provisions of the MRTP Act, though the Scheme prepared and sanctioned under s.45 of the NIT Act may permit such development and/or construction \u2013 In case of a conflict between the MRTP Act and the NIT Act, the MRTP Act will prevail \u2013 Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 \u2013 s.45. Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act, 1966 \u2013 s.39 \u2013 Modification of scheme deleting 15 metres wide road \u2013 Permissibility \u2013 Held: s.39 of the MRTP Act mandates the Planning Authority to vary the Scheme in line with the Development Plan sanctioned under the MRTP Act \u2013 In the transferred case in question, when the DP was sanctioned, without any proposal for the 15 metres internal road, first in the year 1976 and thereafter in the years 1989 and 2001, the same was after following the due procedure and the same was approved and sanctioned by the State Government \u2013 Thereafter, when the Scheme to the extent in conflict with the DP Plan was modified as mandated under s.39 of the MRTP Act, the same cannot be said to be illegal \u2013 Therefore, when s.39 MRTP Act and the provisions of the NIT Act are read harmoniously, the impugned Notification modifying the Scheme and/or Board Resolution modifying the Scheme deleting 15 metres wide road, which is in line with the Development Plan sanctioned under the MRTP Act, cannot be said to be illegal \u2013 Nagpur Improvement Trust Act, 1936 \u2013 s.45.
