An order of transfer is not to be passed as a matter F of routine or merely because an interested party has expressed some apprehension about proper conduct of the trial. The power has to be exercised cautiously and in exceptional situations, where it becomes necessary to do so to provide credibility to the trial.

Allowing the appeal, the Court. HELD: The medical evidence on record proved that the deceased died a homicidal death and cause of death was asphyxia due to strangulation. As far as relation between the accused and the deceased is concerned, the prosecution evidence on record, as stated by PW-1 and PW-2 was corroborated by the fact that the accused himself has admitted his marriage with the deceased, and his strained relations with her. Apart from that it is proved on record that on the date of incident, before midnight, the accused took his wife (deceased) to night show of movie. PW-1 (father of the deceased) and PW-2 (mother of the deceased) have stated that a day before the dead body of the deceased was found, G the accused had come to their house and took his wife on the pretext that he was taking her to night show cinema. Also it is established from the statement of PW-4 that he last saw the deceased with the accused walking towards Ayinavilli (the village where later dead body of the deceased was found). PW-5, who is the gatekeeper of Devi Ganesh Theatre at Mukteswaram, told  that he knew both accused and the deceased, and they purchased A two tickets for last show at 8.00 p.m. Both of these witnesses have proved the fact that soon before her death the deceased was last seen with the accused. Yet another circumstance against the accused brought on the record by PW-6, who has stated that he saw the accused coming alone after midnight from the side of  Ayinavilli and boarding quarry lorry heading to Mummidivaram. Lastly, it is stated on record by the prosecution witnesses that the accused absconded after the incident. The chain of circumstances is complete and leads only to the conclusion that it was the accused/ respondent and he alone, who committed murder of the deceased. [Paras 10 to 15, 18] [71-B-G; 72-F]."

Administration of Justice - Advise of the Court to resort to amicable dispute resolution mechanism, to settle the disputes. Allowing the appeal, the Court  HELD: 1.1 It is only the allegations made in the plaint that H ought to be looked into in the first instance to determine whether the suit filed lies within the ambit of Section 92 CPC. If the A allegations in the plaint indicate that the suit has been filed to remedy the infringement of a private right or to vindicate a private right, then the suit would not fall within the ambit of Section 92 of the CPC. In deciding whether the suit falls within the ambit of Section 92 of the CPC, the Court must consider the purpose for B which the suit was filed. Considering the purpose of the suit filed by the respondents, it is quite clear that it was to highlight the failure of the appellants to take action against the availability of the objectionable book and against the author. The issue whether the book is objectionable or not, whether it deserves to be C proscribed or not, whether it violates the provisions of Section 153-A or Sectiou 295-A IPC has yet to be determined by the Orissa High Court. Until that determination is made, it would be premature to expect the appellants to take any precipitate action in the matter against the author. "

If the order passed in review recalls the main order and a different order is passed, definitely the main order does not exist. In that event, there is no need to challenge the main order, for it is the order in review that affects the aggrieved party. Though the decisions in Shanker Motiram Nale, the two-Judge Bench referred to Order 47 Rule 7 of the Code of Civil Procedure that bars an appeal against the order of the court rejecting the review, it is not to be understood that the court has curtailed the plenary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution by taking recourse to the provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure. It has to be understood that the Court has evolved and formulated a principle that if the basic judgment is not assailed and the challenge is only to the order passed in review, this Court is obliged not to entertain such special leave petition. The said principle has gained the authoritative status and has been treated as a precedential principle for more than two decades and there is hardly any necessity not to be guided by the said precedent.
