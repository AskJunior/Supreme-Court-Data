Land policy - Held: Considering the scheme of the Act, the process of industrialization must take place in accordance therewith - If the law requires a particular thing should be done in a particular manner it must be done in that way and none other -State Government cannot ignore the policy intent and the procedure contemplated by the statute - In the instant case, State Government could have acquired the land, and then either by auction or by considering the merit of proposal, allotted it. Power of statutory authority - Exercise of by Government - Minister permitting further sale - Held: Under s. 89A(3), Government is appellate authority where Collector does not grant a certificate for purchase of bonafide industrial purpose - Thus, powers of statutory authority have been exercised by Government which is an appellate authority - Minister's direction clearly indicates an arbitrary exercise of power - Orders passed by Government cannot, therefore, be sustained - Dictating the Collector to act in a particular manner on the assumption by Minister that it is in the interest of industrial development would lead to a breach of the mandate of statute framed by legislature - Gujarat Tenancy and Agricultural Lands (Vidarbha Region and Kutch Areas) Act, 1958 -- s.89-A.

Admittedly, no attempt was made by the State to take over possession of the disputed land at any point of time - On the    F contrary, permissions were granted from time to  time for construction of buildings on the disputed land - Under the circumstances,  it cannot be said that any of these disputed lands were 'forest' within the primary meaning of that word, or even within the extended meaning given in  s.2(c-i) of the    G Private Forests Act - Maharashtra Private Forests Acquisition Act,  1975 - s.2(c-i), 2(f)(iii).  s.35(3) - Service of notice - Notice was issued to  the appellant in 1957 but no decision was taken thereon ti/11975, that is,  for about 18 years - This is an unusually long period and undoubtedly much more than a reasonable time had elapsed for enabling the State to take a decision on the notice - Therefore, the said notice must, for all intents and purposes B   be treated as having become a dead letter - The said notice  cannot be described as a 'pipeline notice' since it cannot be reasonably said that the pipeline extends from  1956-57 up to 1975 - No citizen can reasonably be told after almost half a century that he/she was issued a show cause notice (which  was not served also) and based on the said notice his land was declared a private forest about three decades ago and that it vests in the State - State cannot be allowed to demolish the massive constructions made thereon over the last half a century - Basic principles of good governance must be  followed by every member of the Executive branch of the State at all times keeping the interests of all citizens in mind as also the larger public interest. MAHARASHTRA PRIVATE FORESTS ACQUISITION ACT,  1975: s.2(f)(iii) - Service of notice - Word \"issued\" in  s.2(f)(iii) of the Act,  1975 r/w s.35 of the Forest Act,  1927 - Interpretation of - Held: It must be given a broad meaning in the surrounding context in which it is used - The scheme of s.35 of the Forest Act needs to be kept in mind while considering ''issued\" in s.2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act - A notice u/s.35(3) of the Forest Act is intended to give an opportunity to the owner of a forest to show cause why,  inter alia,  a regulatory or a prohibitory measure be not made in respect of that forest - Such a notice pre-supposes the existence of a forest - The owner of the forest is expected to  file objections within a reasonable time as specified in  the notice and is also given an opportunity to lead evidence in support of the objections - After these basic requirements are met,  the owner of the forest is entitled to  a hearing on the objections - This entire procedure obviously cannot be  followed by the State and the owner of the forest unless the owner is served with the notice - s. 2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests    A Act is not intended to apply to notices that had passed their shelf-life and that only 'pipeline notices' issued in reasonably close proximity to the coming into force of the Private Forests Act are 'live' and could be acted upon.  INTERPRETATION     OF     STATUTES:     Literal interpretation or contextual interpretation - Held: Words in a statute must be interpreted literally - But at the same time if the context in which a word is used and the provisions of a\u00b7 statute inexorably suggest a subtext other than literal, then the    C context becomes important - It is true that ordinary rule of construction is to assign the word a meaning which it ordinarily carries - But the subject of legislation and the context in which  a word or expression is employed may require a departure from the rule of literal construction.

ELECTION LAWS: Election dispute - Applicability of doctrine of equity - Heid: Statutory requirements relating to election law have to be strictly adhered to for the reason that an election dispute is a statutory proceeding unknown to the common law and thus, the doctrine of equity, etc. does not apply in such dispute - All the technicalities prescribed/mandated in election law have been provided to safeguard the purity of the election process and courts have a duty to enforce the same with all rigours and not to minimize their operation - Representation of People Act, 1957. Recounting of votes - Essential conditions to be satisfied - Discussed. Jurisdiction of court to order recount of votes - Held: Court cannot exercise discretion of ordering recounting of ballots just to enable the election petitioner to indulge in a roving inquiry with a view to fish material for dealing the election to be void - The order of recounting can be passed only if the petitioner sets out his case with precision supported by averments of material facts.Instructions contained in the Handbook for Returning Officer - Birding effect - Held: it is a settled legal proposition that the instructions contained in the handbook for Returning Officer are issued by the Election Commission in exercise of its statutory functions and are therefore, binding on the Returning Officers. CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS RULES, 1961: r.73(2)(d) - Marking and writing on ballot papers - Held: r.73(2)(d) provides that a ballot paper shall be invalid if \u201cthere is any mark or wring by which the elector can be identified.\" - There must be some casual connection between the mark and the identity of the voter and such writing or marking itself must reasonably give indication of the voter's identity - As to whether such marking or writing in a particular case would disclose the identity of the voter, would depend on the nature of writing or marking on the ballot involved in each case - Therefore, such marking or writing must be such as to draw an inference about the identity of the voter. PLEADINGS: Held: A decision of the case should not be based on grounds outside the pleadings of the parties - In absence of pleadings, evidence if any, produced by the parties, cannot be considered - No party should be permitted to travel beyond its pleadings and parties are bound to take all necessary and material facts in support of the case set up by them.

No doubt, the court cannot go behind the decree or beyond the decree - But while executing a decree for specific performance, the court, in case of any ambiguity, has necessarily fo construe the decree so as to give effect to the intention of the parties - Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 - 0.8, r. 10. SPECIFIC RELIEF ACT, 1963: s.28 - Application for rescission - Suit for specific performance decreed in 1984 - Execution petition filed in 1990 - Application u/s 28 filed in 1999 - Held: Though execution petition was filed within the time prescribed, the efflux of time assumes importance and seriousness in the background of escalation of price in real estate resulting in liability of vendors towards unearned increase - Court failed to advert to this aspect -- It is pertinent also to note that the said liability for the vendors arose only on account of delayed execution of decree - Further. vendors did not get an opportunity to make their response to oral submission made by purchaser with regard to deposit of the balance consideration, after passage of around 26 years from the date of decree - As in the case of a decree for specific performance where equity weighs with the court, so is the situation in considering an application u/s 28 for rescinding the contract - On such an application, the court may, by order, rescind the contract \u201cas the justice of the case may require\u201d - In the. peculiar facts and circumstances of case, the trial court should have passed an equitable order while considering the application for rescission - For doing complete justice to parties, it is a case where purchaser should be directed to pay the land value to vendors as per the circle rate notified for the residential property in Category \u2018A\u2019 colonies prevailing during November 16, 2011 to January 5, 2012 -- Purchaser shall also be liable to meet the liability arising by way of unearned increase to be paid to L&DO - Further, directions given in case. the plaintiff does not deposit the amount fo be paid to the vendors - Equity - Constitution of india, 1950 - Art.142."

Held: In Express Newspaper, the Constitution Bench has held the 1955 Act as intra-vires the Constitution - The Act being a beneficent legislation intended to regulate conditions of service of working journalists does not have the effect of taking away or abridging the freedom of speech and expression of petitioners- newspapers and does not, therefore, infringe Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution - Nor could it be held to be violative of Art. 19(1 )(g) of the Constitution in view of the test of reasonableness - Challenge as to the singling out of newspaper industry per se was rejected by the Constitution Bench holding it to be a class by itself- The 1974 amendment Act brought the other employees of newspaper industry (i.e. non-working journalists) into the ambit of the Act and extended the benefits of the Act to them - Thus, the same is also covered as per the reasoning of the Constitution Bench decision - Mere passage of time by itself would not result in invalidation of the Act and its object -- Challenge as to the vires of the Act on the premise of it being ultra vires the Constitution and violative of fundamental rights is wholly unfounded, baseless and completely untenable.WORKING JOURNALISTS AND OTHER NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES (CONDITIONS OF SERVICE) AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS ACT, 1955ss. 9 and 13-C - Government of India Notification dated 11. 11. 2011 notifying the recommendations of Justice Majithia Wage Boards - Held: As regards constitution of Wage Boards, merely because a person had been in the employment of the Government, he does not cease to become \"independent\" for the purposes of being a member of the Committee to recommend the fixing of wages - Allegation of bias against independent members of Wage Boards, being based merely on their past status, is entirely baseless in law and amounts to imputing motives - Administrative law - Legal bias.ss. 9 and 13 - Composition of Wage Boards - Held: To have common representatives of the employers on the two Wage Boards, four independent members, including the Chairman being common for both the Wage Boards, and separate set of members representing working journalists and members representing non-journalist newspaper employees in no way affects the interest of the employers and the challenge of the petitioners in this regard is unfounded.s.11(1) r/w s.10(1) - Procedure followed by Wage Boards - Held: Wage Board has special powers to regulate its own procedure -- As long as it follows the principles of natural F justice and fairness, its functioning cannot be called into question on the ground of irregularity in the procedure - In the instant case, detailed questionnaires were issued to newspaper establishments, notices inviting representations were published in 125 newspapers -- Wage Boards G conducted a series of meetings and gave ample opportunities to the employers to make their point of view known to the Board by written and oral representation - Court is satisfied that the decision making process stands valid - The. petitioners, having eluded to submit the data, cannot be  allowed to take advantage of their own wrong and impugn the recommendations of Wage Boards - Further, no prejudice is caused to employers by classifying them in eight categories on the basis of gross tum over - There is no irregularity in the procedure adopted by Wage Boards.s. 10(2) and 12 - Recommendations of Wage Boards and its acceptance by Central Government - Held: capacity of newspaper industry to pay is one of the essential circumstances to be taken into consideration while fixing rates of wages under the Act - Comprehensive and detailed study has been carried out by Wage Boards by collecting all relevant materials for the purpose of wage revision - Recommendations are arrived at after weighing the pros and cons of various methods in the process and principles of wage revision in modern era - It cannot be held that the wage structure recommended by Majithia Wage Boards is unreasonable - As regards the issue of wages for News \u00b7 Agencies to be fixed separately and independently, in view of limited jurisdiction to look into this aspect, it would be inapposite for the Court to question the decision of specialized board on merits especially when the Board was constituted for this sole purpose - Besides, it is the prerogative of Central - Government to accept or reject the recommendations of Wage Boards - There is no scope for hearing the parties once again by Central Government while accepting or modifying the recommendations, except that modifications are of such nature which alter the character of the recommendations and such modification is likely to affect the parties - Recommendations of Majithia Wage Boards are valid in law and there is no valid ground for interference under Art.32 of the Constitution.Implementation of recommendations of Wage Boards - Held: Wages as revised/determined shall be payable from 11.11.2011, when Government of India notified the recommendations of the Majithia Wage Boards, and as directed\u00b7 in the judgment."

            "Purpose of enactment"
        ],
        "HeadNote": " PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION ACT, 1988: Purpose of enactment - Held: Although Indian Penal  Code provided for punishment for the offence of bribery and corruption even against the public servants, Parliament, in its wisdom, noticed that the Code was not adequate to meet the exigencies of time and a need was felt to introduce a special legislation with a view to eradicate the evil of bribery and corruption from the society - Consequently, the Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted - Penal Code, 1860.s.3(1) - Jurisdiction of Special Judge to proceed against a non-public servant - Held: A Special Judge appointed u/s.3(1) of the PC Act has got jurisdiction to proceed exclusively against a public servant and exclusively against a non-public servant as well, depending upon the nature of the offence referred to in Chapter Ill of the PC Act - Junction of a public servant is not a must for the Special Judge to proceed against a non-public servant for any offence alleged to have been committed by him under Chapter Ill of the PC Act - A conjoint reading of s.3(1) along with ss. 4(1) and (2) would make it amply clear that only the Special Judge has got the jurisdiction to try the offences specified in sub-section (1) of s.3 committed by a public servant or a non-public servant, alone or jointly.s.3(1) - Non-framing of charge against the public servant and private persons, u/s.3(1), while public servant was alive - Held: In such a situation, the Special Judge had no occasion to \"try any case\" u/s.3(1) of the PC Act, either against a public servant or a private person, so as to try any offence other than an offence specified in s.3, meaning thereby, non-PC offences against private person - Special Judge appointed u/s.3(1) could exercise the powers under sub-section (3) to s.4 to try non-PC offence - Therefore, trying a case by Special Judge u/s.3(1) is a sine qua non for, exercising jurisdiction by the Special Judge for trying an offence other than an offence specified in s.3 - \"Trying any case'~ u/s.3(1) is, therefore, a jurisdictional fact for the Special Judge to exercise powers to try Non-PC offence .s.4(3) - 'Trying any case' interpretation of - Held: It means trying any case relating to the offences referred to in ss.3 (1)(a) and (b) of Act for which .exclusive jurisdiction is conferred on the Special Judge - A Special Judge, while exercising, exclusive jurisdiction, this, when trying any case relating to offences u/ss.3(1)(a) and (b) of the Act, may also try any offence other than the offence specified in s.3, with which the accused may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 be charged at the same trial - An accused person, either a public servant or non~public servant, who has been charged for an offence u/s.3(1) of the PC Act, could also be charged for an offence under /PC, in the event of which, the Special Judge has got the jurisdiction to try such offences against the public servant as well as against a non-public servant - Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.ss.4(1), 4(3) - Obligation on the part of Special judge to try Non-PC cases - Held: Exclusion of the jurisdiction of ordinary Criminal Court, so far as offer:ices under the PC Act are concerned, has been explicitly expressed u/s.4(1) of the PC Act, which does not find a place, in respect of non-PC offences in sub-section (3) of s.4 of the PC Act - It is not obligatory on the part of a Special Judge to try non-PC offences - The expression \"may also try\" gives an element of discretion on the part of the Special Judge which will depend upon the facts of each case and the inter-relation between PC offences and non-PC offences - A Special Judge exercising powers under the PC Act is not expected to try non- PC offences totally unconnected with any PC offences u/s.3(1) of the PC Act and in the event of a Special Judge not trying \u00b7\u00b7any offence u/s.3(1) of the PC Act, the question of the Special Judge trying non-PC offences does not arise - Trying of a PC offence is a jurisdictional fact to exercise the powers under sub-section (3) of s.4 - Jurisdiction of the Special Judge, as such, has not been divested, but the exercise of jurisdiction, depends upon the jurisdictional fact of trying a PC offence.s.4(3) - .Death of public servant and charges framed against public servant and private person - Held: Once the\u00b7 power has been exercised by the Special Judge u/sub-section (3) of s.4 of the PC Act to proceed against non-PC offences along with PC offences, the mere fact that the sole public servant dies after the exercise of powers under sub-section (3) of s.4, will not divest the jurisdiction of the Special Judge or vitiate the proceedings pending before him - The trying of any case under the PC Act against a public servant or a private person is a sine-qua-non for exercising powers under sub-section (3) of s.4 of PC Act - In the instant case, since no PC offence has been committed by any of the non-public servants and no charges have been framed against the public servant, while he was alive, the Special Judge had no occasion to try any case against any of them under the PC F Act, since no charge has been framed prior to the death of the public servant.JURISDICTION of a Court or a Tribunal - Held: Existence of a jurisdictional fact is thus a sine qua non or condition precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction by a Court.

        "HeadNote": " TRANSFER OF PROPERTY ACT, 1882: Housing Society - Transfer of membership/flat - Validity of - Flat given on rent to the son of the respondent - Letters written by appellant to Society for transferring the said flat in favour of respondent on account of close relationship between them - Transfer was without consideration - Arbitrator held the letters of transfer invalid - Cooperative Tribunal and High Court held that approach of arbitrator was erroneous - Held: Respondent was mother-in-law of niece of appellant - Therefore factually the expression of close relationship depicted in the letters was false - As regards transfer without consideration, respondent herself gave statement to the effect that appellant had transferred the flat for consideration of Rs.4.29 lacs which was in form of shares belonging to the son of the respondent - However, on the date of execution of transfer or even when board resolution was passed, the son of the respondent did not have any shares in his name said to have been transferred to appellant as consideration of the flat - Therefore, all the ingredients of the letters were shrouded _ in suspicious circumstances - The stance of appellant regarding transfer of shares was that same was return of loan extended by her to son of the respondent for business venture - This factual position was overlooked by Cooperative Tribunal and High Court - Arbitrator held that the appellant was in Bombay and not in Calcutta when these letters were written - Said finding was recorded on the basis of 3 witnesses produced on behalf of appellant before the arbitrator - Cooperative Tribunal overlooked the statement of witnesses merely because notary was an Advocate - Conclusion of Cooperative Tribunal and High Court that the documents were executed in Calcutta was therefore basec .on no evidence - Further, respondent continued to pay rent into the account of appellant - Accordingly, arbitrator rightly inferred that even to the knowledge of respondent, flat was not actually transferred to her name. Housing Society - Transfer of membership/flat - Revocation of - Withdrawal letter revoking letters of transfer was sent by appellant before the transfer of membership/lat had attained finality - Still, Society did not consider the withdrawal letter - Acceptance or rejection on merits is another matter, but non-consideration clearly invalidated the resolution of transfer passed by society. Transfer of membership/flat - Validity of - Fiduciary relation - Held: When parties are in fiduciary relationship, the manner of examining the validity of a transaction specifically when there is no reciprocal consideration has to be based on parameters which are different from those applicable to an ordinary case. Transfer of membership/flat without consideration - Relationship of faith, trust and confidence - Letters written by appellant to Housing Society for transferring her flat to the name of the respondent - Held: There was no justification for the appellant to transfer her flat fo respondent free of cost specially when she has no direct intimate relationship with respondent - Son of respondent was married to niece of appellant and so he was in domineering position - He enjoyed trust and confidence of appellant which was apparent from the fact that the Joint account of appellant with the son of the respondent was operated by him exclusively and drafting of the letters of transfer of flat was done by him on behalf of appellant -'In such fact situation, the onus of substantiating the validity and genuineness of the transfer of flat by the appellant rested squarely on the shoulders of the respondent which she miserably failed to discharge. CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, 1908: Pleadings - Rejoinder - Non consideration of facts stated in the rejoinder - Effect of - Respondent-defendant in written replies adopted stand contrary to documents relied upon by rival parties - Number of documents not mentioned by appellant-plaintiff in the dispute case relied upon by respondent - Held: Arbitrator recorded his findings in the award not only on the pleadings including rejoinder but also on the basis of evidence led in | support of said ple\u2019dings - Thus, arbtirator acted in accordance with law and therefore exclusion from consideration of factual position asserted by appellant in her rejoinder by the Cooperative Triounal and High Court was wholly unjustified. : DOCTRINES/PRINCIPLES: Principle of estoppel - Applicability of - Discussed. Principle of justice and equity and doctrine of faimess - Applicability of. Evidence Act, 1872: s.115 - Estoppel - Salient pre- condition for invoking rule of estoppel - Discussed - In the instant case, the first party made no representation, the second party did not accept any representation and did not act in any manner nor second party altered its position - Therefore, the question whether the restoration of the original position would be iniquitous or unfair did not arise. NOTARY ACT, s.8 - Notarization of document - Non issuance of notarial certificate - Held: In the absence of issuance of certificate, notarization of document becomes Suspicious. "

Recovery Officer to adjourn the sale by recording his reasons\u00b7 D for such adjournment - As far as sub-rule (2) is concerned, the same is clear to the effect that a sale of immovable property once adjourned under sub-rule (1) for a longer period than one calendar month, a fresh proclamation of sale should be made unless the defaulter consents to waive it - The said E sub-rule also does not conflict with any of the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, in particular s.13 or rr.8 and 9.s.35 - Non obstante clause - Held: s.35 states that the provisions of the SARFAESI Act will have overriding effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent contained in any other law for the time being in force - Therefore, reading s.35 and s.37 together, it will have to be held that in the event of any of the provisions of RDDB Act not being inconsistent with the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the application of both the Acts, namely, SARFAESI Act and RDDB Act, would be complementary to each other - The effect of s.37 would, therefore, be that in addition to the provisions contained under the SARFAESI Act, in respect of proceedings initiated under the said Act, it will be in order for a party to fall back upon the provisions of the other Acts mentioned in s.37 namely, the Companies Act, 1956, the Securities Contract& (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992, the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Finances Institutions Act, 1993, or any other law for the time being in B force - Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Finances Institutions Act, 1993.SECURITY INTEREST (ENFORCEMENT) RULES, 2002:rr.8 and 9 - Procedure to be followed by a secured creditor while resorting to a sale after the issuance of the proceedings u/s s.13(1) to (4) of the SARFAESI Act - Held: Reading sub-rule (6) of r.8 and sub-rule (1) of r.9 together, the service of individual notice to the borrower, specifying clear D 30 days time gap for effecting any sale of immovable secured asset is a statutory mandate - No sale should be affected before the expiry of 30 days from the date on which the public notice of sale is published in the newspapers - Therefore, the requirement u/r.8(6) and r.9(1) contemplates E a clear 30 days individual notice to the borrower and also a public notice by way of publication in the newspapers.rr.8 and 9 - Sale effected in favour of appellant without complying with the mandatory requirement of 30 days notice to the borrower - High Court set aside the sale and passed F interim order directing the borrower to furnish demand draft of Rs.2 crores in favour of appellant and in case of non- payment directed to confirm sale in favour of appellant - Payment not made by borrowers - Request by borrowers for six weeks time to arrange money - By another interim order, G High Court extended time and permitted 8th respondent to deposit Rs.2.03 crores and on such deposit to cancel sale in favour of appellant - Held: Since very valuable rights of the appellant were at stakes, there was no justification at all for High Court to interfere with the said right in such a casual H manner by passing interim orders on flimsy grounds raised by borrowers - Ownership right which accrued in favour bf appellant ought not to have been interfered with by the High Court - Interim orders set aside - Value of the property was knocked out in favour of the appellant for Rs. 1. 27 crores - Since proper procedure for effecting sale was not followed, the price fetched through the appellant cannot be held to be the correct price for the mortgaged property - In the year 2010 the property could fetch Rs.2.03 crores while the price paid by the appellant was Rs.1.27 crores - Therefore, after giving credit of Rs.1.27 crores, the appellant directed to pay a further sum of Rs. 76 lacs to the borrowers.

SHA, TKHA, SSHAs and STKHA, Agreed Principles and IPLA, including the controversy as to whether IPLA is a concluded contract are referred to arbitral tribunal for adjudication -Third arbitrator who shall act as Chairman of Arbitral Tribunal, is appointed -- Arbitration clause (agreement) is independent of the underlying contract, i.e. the IPLA containing the arbitration clause -- s.16 provides that arbitration clause forming part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of such a contract -- UNCITRAL Model Law.s. 16 - Separability of arbitration clause from underlying contract - Held: Concept of separability of the arbitration clause/agreement from the underlying contract is a necessity 8 to ensure that the intention of parties to resolve disputes by arbitration does not get frustrated with every challenge to legality, validity, finality or breach of the underlying contract - The Act, u/s 16 accepts the concept that the main contract and the arbitration agreement form two independent contracts C - Therefore, it cannot be accepted that Arbitration Agreement will perish as the IPLA has not been finalised - Rule of necessity.Arbitration clause - Seemingly unworkable arbitration clause - Held: It would be the duty of court to make the same workable within the permissible limits of law - A common sense approach has to be adopted to give effect to the intention of parties to arbitrate - Arbitration clause cannot be construed with a purely legalistic mindset, as if one is construing a provision in a statute - In the instant case, the arbitration clause as it stands cannot be frustrated on the ground that it is unworkable - Unworkability in the case is attributed only to the machinery provision - Arbitration agreement, otherwise, fulfils the criteria laid down u/s 44 of the Act - Given that two arbitrators have been appointed, the missing line that \"the two arbitrators appointed by the parties shall appoint the third arbitrator\" can be read into the arbitration clause - Omission is so obvious that the court can legitimately supply the missing line - In the circumstances, the Court would apply the officious bystander principle - Parties can be permitted to proceed to arbitration.Seat' of arbitration and 'venue' -- International Commercial Arbitration - Held: In an International Commercial Arbitration, venue can often be different from the. seat of arbitration - In the instant case all the three laws: (i) A the law governing the substantive contract; (ii) the law governing the agreement to arbitrate and the performance of that agreement; and (iii) the law governing the conduct of the arbitration, are Indian - Therefore, the parties have designated India as the seat - Parties being Indian and German, except B for London being chosen as a convenient place/venue for holding the meetings of arbitration, there is no other factor connecting the arbitration proceedings to London - In such circumstances, hearing of arbitration will be conducted at the venue fixed by the parties, but this would not bring about a c change in the seat of arbitration - Therefore, the seat would remain in India.Concurrent jurisdiction - International Commercial Arbitration - Held: High Court having fixed the seat in India, committed an error in concluding that Courts in England D would have concurrent jurisdiction - It runs counter to the settled position of law in India as well as in England and would lead to unnecessary complications and inconvenience - Once the seat of arbitration has been fixed in India, it would be in the nature of exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the supervisory  powers over the arbitration - In view of s. 2, CPC, Daman trial court (India) has jurisdiction over the matter.Anti suit injunction - International Commercial Arbitration - Suit in Daman court (India) for declaration that substantial F contract was not a concluded contract and correspondingly there was no arbitration agreement therein - Anti suit injunction granted by Daman Court against proceedings initiated in the English High Court - Held: Conclusion of the Bombay High Court that the anti-suit injunction granted by the Daman trial court has been correctly vacated by Daman appellate court is overruled and set aside -- Consequential directions given in the judgment.

Power of Labour Court/Industrial Adjudicator - Scope of - Held: The powers of the industrial adjudicator under the F Industrial Disputes Act are wide - By empowering the adjudicator authorities under the Act, to give reliefs such as a reinstatement of wrongfully dismissed or discharged workmen, which may not be permissible in common law or justified under the terms of the contract between the employer G and such workmen, the legislature has attempted to frustrate the unfair labour practices and secure the policy of collective bargaining as a road to industrial peace - In order to achieve the said objectives, the Labour Courts/Industrial Tribunals are given wide powers not only to enforce the rights but even to s create new rights, with the underlying objective to achieve social justice - The said sweeping power conferred upon the Tribunal is not unbridled - It is, thus, this fine balancing which is required to be achieved while adjudicating a particular dispute, keeping in mind that the industrial disputes are settled by industrial adjudication on principle of (air play and justice. Regularization of daily wagers - Claim for - Held: When there are posts available, in the absence of any unfair labour practice the Labour Court would not give direction for regularization only because a worker has continued as daily wage worker adhoc/temporary worker for number of years - Further, if there are no posts available, such a direction for regularization would be impermissible - In these circumstances giving of direction to regularize such a person, only on the basis of number of years put in by such a worker as daily wager etc. may amount to backdoor entry into the service which is an anathema to Art. 14 of the Constitution - Further, such a direction would not be given when the concerned worker does not meet the eligibility requirement of the post in question as per the Recruitment Rules - However, wherever it is found that similarly situated workmen are regularized by the employer itself under some scheme or otherwise and the workmen in question who have approached Industrial/Labour Court are at par with them, direction of regularization in such cases may be legally justified, otherwise, non-regularization of the left out workers itself would amount to invidious discrimination qua them in such cases and would be violative of Art. 14 of the Constitution - Constitution of India, 1950 - Article 14. Termination of daily wagers - Circular issued by the employer whereby any temporary worker employed for more than 90 days was entitled for regularization of his service and following the said circular, the company had regularized the \u00b7 H services of 70-75 similarly situated casual workers - Claim for regularization by appellants-daily wagers - Held: In the instant case, appellant no: 1 was not in service on the date when the scheme was promulgated as his services were dispensed with, 4 years before that circular - Therefore, the relief of monetary compensation in lieu of reinstatement would be more appropriate in his case - However, in so far as appellant no. 2 was concerned, when the Circular was issued, he was in service and within few months of the issuing of that Circular he had completed 240 days of service - Non-regularization of appellant No.2, while giving the benefit of that Circular to other similar situated employees and regularizing them would, therefore, be clearly discriminatory.
