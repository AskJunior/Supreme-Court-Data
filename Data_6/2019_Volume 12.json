Constitution of India: Separation of powers \u2013 India has a written Constitution which is supreme and adumbrates as well as divides powers, roles and functions of the three wings of the State - the legislature, the executive and the judiciary \u2013 These divisions are boundaries and limits fixed by the Constitution to check and prevent transgression by any one of the three branches into the powers, functions and tasks that fall within the domain of the other wing \u2013 The three branches have to respect the constitutional division and not disturb the allocation of roles and functions between the triad \u2013 Adherence to the constitutional scheme dividing the powers and functions is a guard and check against potential abuse of power and the rule of law is secured when each branch observes the constitutional limitations to their powers, functions and roles \u2013 Modern theory of separation of powers does not accept that the three branches perform mutually isolated roles and functions and accepts a need for coordinated institutional effort for good governance, albeit emphasise on benefits of division of power and labour by accepting the three wings do have separate and distinct roles and functions that are defined by the Constitution \u2013 All the institutions must act within their own jurisdictions and not trespass into the jurisdiction of other \u2013 By segregating the powers and functions of the institutions, the Constitution ensures a structure where the institutions function as per their institutional strengths. Constitution of India: Powers and functions of legislature \u2013 Held: The legislature as an elected and representative body enacts laws to give effect to and fulfil democratic aspirations of the people \u2013 Legislature functions as a deliberative and representative body \u2013 It is directly accountable and answerable to the electorate and citizens of this country \u2013 This representativeness and principle of accountability is what gives legitimacy to the legislations and laws made by Parliament or the state legislatures. Constitution of India: Arts.73 and 162 \u2013 Powers and functions of executive \u2013 Held: The executive has the primary responsibility of formulating government policies and proposing legislations which when passed by the legislature become laws \u2013 By virtue of Arts.73 and 162 of the Constitution, the powers and functions of the executive are wide and expansive, as they cover matters in respect of which Parliament/state legislature can make laws and vests with the executive the authority and jurisdiction exercisable by the Government of India or the State Government, as the case may be \u2013 As a delegate of the legislative bodies and subject to the terms of the legislation, the executive makes second stage laws known as \u2018subordinate or delegated legislation\u2019 \u2013 In fields where there is no legislation, the executive has the power to frame policies, schemes, etc., which is co-extensive with the power of Parliament or the state legislature to make laws \u2013 At the same time, the political executive is accountable to the legislature and holds office till they enjoy the support and confidence of the legislature \u2013 Thus, there is interdependence, interaction and even commonality of personnel/ members of the legislature and the executive \u2013 The executive, therefore, performs multi-functional role and is not monolithic. Constitution of India: Role of judiciary \u2013 Judges unlike members of the legislature represent no one, strictly speaking not even the citizens \u2013 Judges are not accountable and answerable as the political executive is to the legislature and the elected representatives are to the electorate \u2013 This independence ensures that the judges perform the constitutional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution while exercising the power of judicial review in a fair and even-handed manner without pressure and favours \u2013 As an interpreter, guardian and protector of the Constitution, the judiciary checks and curbs violation of the Constitution by the Government when they overstep their constitutional limits, violate the basic structure of the Constitution, infringe fundamental rights or act contrary to law \u2013 Power of judicial review has expanded taking within its ambit the concept of social and economic justice \u2013 Yet, while exercising this power of judicial review, the courts do not encroach upon the field marked by the Constitution for the legislature and the executive, as the courts examine legality and validity of the legislation or the governmental action, and not the wisdom behind the legislative measure or relative merits or demerits of the governmental action \u2013 Neither does the Constitution permit the courts to direct, advise or sermonise others in the spheres reserved for them by the Constitution, provided the legislature or the executive do not transgress their constitutional limits or statutory conditions. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power \u2013 The doctrine restrains the legislature from declaring the judgment of a court to be void and of no effect, while the legislature still possesses the legislative competence of enacting a validating law which remedies the defect pointed out in the judgment \u2013 However, this does not ordain and permit the legislature to declare a judgment as invalid by enacting a law, but permits the legislature to take away the basis of the judgment by fundamentally altering the basis on which it was pronounced \u2013 Therefore, while exercising all important checks and balances function, each wing should be conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on them to ensure that institutional respect and comity is maintained \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Judgment/Order \u2013 Legislation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of separation of power \u2013 Distinction between interpretation and adjudication by the courts on one hand and the power to enact legislation by the legislature on the other \u2013 Adjudication results in what is often described as judge made law, but the interpretation of the statutes and the rights in accordance with the provisions of Articles 14, 19 and 21 in the course of adjudication is not an attempt or an act of legislation by the judges \u2013 Legislature itself entrusts the judiciary to lay down parameters in the form of precedents which is oft-spoken as judge made law \u2013 Such law, even if made by the judiciary, would not infringe the doctrine of separation of powers and is in conformity with the constitutional functions \u2013 Thus, law-making within certain limits is a legitimate element of a judge\u2019s role, if not inevitable \u2013 A judge has to adjudicate and decide on the basis of legal provisions, which when indeterminate on a particular issue require elucidation and explanation \u2013 This requires a judge to interpret the provisions to decide the case and, in this process, he may take recourse and rely upon fundamental rights, including the right to life, but even then he does not legislate a law while interpreting such provisions \u2013 Such interpretation is called \u2018judge made law\u2019 but not legislation \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Judge made law. \u2018The Constitutional Separation of Powers\u2019 by Aieleen Kavanagh \u2013 referred to. Legislation: Power/Duty of legislature and judiciary \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Held: Legislating or law-making involves a choice to prioritise certain political, moral and social values over the others from a wide range of choices that exist before the legislature \u2013 It is a balancing and integrating exercise to give expression/meaning to diverse and alternative values and blend it in a manner that it is representative of several viewpoints so that it garners support from other elected representatives to pass institutional muster and acceptance \u2013 Legislation, in the form of an enactment or laws, lays down broad and general principles \u2013 It is the source of law which the judges are called upon to apply \u2013 Judges, when they apply the law, are constrained by the rules of language and by well identified background presumptions as to the manner in which the legislature intended the law to be read \u2013 Application of law by the judges is not synonymous with the enactment of law by the legislature \u2013 Judges have the power to spell out how precisely the statute would apply in a particular case \u2013 In this manner, they complete the law formulated by the legislature by applying it \u2013 This power of interpretation or the power of judicial review is exercised post the enactment of law, which is then made subject matter of interpretation or challenge before the courts. Interpretation of statutes: While exercising the interpretative power, the courts can draw strength from the spirit and propelling elements underlying the Constitution to realise the constitutional values but must remain alive to the concept of judicial restraint which requires the judges to decide cases within defined limits of power \u2013 Thus, the courts would not accept submissions and pass orders purely on a matter of policy or formulate judicial legislation which is for the executive or elected representatives of the people to enact."

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.100, proviso \u2013 The proviso to s.100 makes it clear that the Court has the power to hear the appeal from any substantial questions of law not formulated by it, if it is satisfied that the case involves such questions \u2013 However, in such eventuality, the Court has to record its reasons for formulating such questions of law \u2013 This obviously means that the Court will pass a reasoned order while formulating the substantial question(s) of law at this stage \u2013 The natural corollary is that the parties have to be heard after the framing of such substantial questions of law \u2013 The hearing cannot be prior to the substantial questions of law."

Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 ss.3 and 4 \u2013 Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 \u2013 s.8 and 13(2) \u2013 r/w. s.13(1)(d) \u2013 Interrogation of the accused \u2013 Interferences of Judiciary in \u2013 Held: Interrogation of the accused and the answers elicited from the accused and the opinion whether the answers given by the accused are \u2018satisfactory\u2019 or \u2018evasive\u2019, is purely within the domain of the investigating agency and the Court cannot substitute its views by conducting mini trial at various stages of investigation.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.438 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 21 \u2013 Right of anticipatory bail, a part of Art.21 of the Constitution of India or not \u2013 Held: The legislative intent behind the introduction of s.438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual\u2019s personal liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake \u2013 Therefore, a delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights-safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest \u2013 It cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial of the rights conferred upon the appellant u/Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018reason to believe\u2019 \u2013 Held: As per definition in s.26 IPC, a person is said to be have \u2018reason to believe\u2019 a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing but not otherwise \u2013 The specified officer must have \u2018reason to believe\u2019 on the basis of material in his possession that the property sought to be attached is likely to be concealed, transferred on dealt with in a manner which may result in frustrating any proceedings for confiscation of their property under the Prevention of Money - Laundering Act, 2002.

year 2019-20, for the seats reserved for the Sports quota \u2013 Appellant-candidate had applied for admission under Sports quota \u2013 As per the Prospectus, the applications for admission under Sports Quota are submitted to the Kerala Sports Council, which allots marks to candidates according to their proficiency in sports \u2013 The marks list of candidates under \u201cIndividual Events\u201d and \u201cTeam Events\u201d are prepared separately and forwarded to the Commissioner for Entrance Examinations (CEE) \u2013 In the case of candidates seeking admission to Medical courses, the marks for proficiency in sports are awarded out of 500, which are added to the marks obtained by the candidates in NEET-UG 2019 \u2013 The seats under the Sports Quota are filled up by giving equal representation to students in both the team categories \u2013 NEET-UG 2019 Examination was conducted on 5.5.2019 \u2013 On 19.5.2019, the Sports Council published the provisional list of candidates eligible for the Sports Quota, both in the Individual and the Team Categories, and invited objections to the same \u2013 Appellant raised no objection to the provisional list \u2013 On 27.5.2019, the Final List of eligible candidates under both the Individual and Team Quotas was prepared \u2013 Appellant did not raise any objection even at this stage \u2013 Final list was forwarded to the State CEE \u2013 On 6.6.2019, the All India NEET-UG 2019 result was declared \u2013 CEE published the category-wise list of candidates eligible for M.B.B.S., including the Sports Quota in the Individual and the Team Category on 28.6.2019 \u2013 There were 7 seats available for the Sports Quota for admission to M.B.B.S. course, while 2 seats were reserved for B.D.S. \u2013 Out of 7 seats, 4 seats were allotted to the Individual event category, and 3 were allotted to the Team event category \u2013 Appellant secured final marks of 548.4722 in the NEET-UG examination, after including the marks awarded to him in the Individual category \u2013 Respondent No.5 was awarded 669.1667 in the Sports Individual category while Respondent No.1 was awarded 594.0278 in the Team category \u2013 Appellant filed a Representation to the Sports Council alleging that Respondent No. 5 had wrongly been included in the Individual List, as he had participated in a Team event \u2013 Appellant then filed writ petition before High Court praying inter alia for a direction to Sports Council to re-consider the marks allotted to him and consider shifting Respondent No. 5 to the Sports (Team) List \u2013 During the pendency of the Writ Petition, on 6.7.2019, the State Sports Council informed CEE that 4 candidates including Respondent No.5 had erroneously been included in the Final Individual List, even though they ought to have been included in the Team List \u2013 CEE declined to consider communication dated 6.7.2019 received after the publication of the final list \u2013 Single Judge of High Court allowed the Writ Petition, holding that CEE was obligated to act on the communication of the State Sports Council \u2013 Accordingly, Respondent No.5 was directed to be considered for admission in the Sports (Team) List \u2013 Aggrieved, Respondent no.1 filed writ appeal \u2013 Division Bench of High Court set aside the order of single judge and directed that the rank of Respondent no. 1 and 5 be retained as per the list prepared on 28.6.2019 \u2013 Hence the appeal \u2013 Held: Writ Petition by the Appellant was wholly speculative in nature \u2013 The entire case of the Appellant was based upon shifting Respondent No.5 from the Individual Quota to the Team Quota so that Appellant gets selected in the Individual category, and having the marks added to his NEET score \u2013 Such a plea was wholly unfounded, particularly since out of the candidates in the Sports (Individual) category, the Appellant admittedly scored the lowest marks \u2013 Respondent No. 1 had secured 57 marks, while Respondent No. 5 had secured 53 marks \u2013 Appellant did not disclose in the Writ Petition, that if the relief prayed for was granted, it would have resulted in the displacement of another student in the Team category who had scored 60 marks in the final result who was not even joined as a party to the proceedings \u2013 Hence, the prayer made by the Appellant was liable to be rejected on this ground also \u2013 The entire case of the Appellant was an afterthought, and made at a belated stage of the admission process, and cannot be entertained \u2013 Appellant ought to have approached this Court with candour, and disclosed the correct facts \u2013 Sports Council was wholly unjustified in making a recommendation for shifting Respondent No. 5 after the release of Final List \u2013 The consequence of implementing such a direction at such a belated stage, would be that the entire admission process under the Sports Quota would require to be re-done \u2013 The prayer of the Appellant to consider Respondent No. 5 in the Sports (Team) Quota was unsustainable on merits \u2013 Appeals dismissed. CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 7025- 7026 of 2019. From the Judgment and Order dated 07.08.2019 of the High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam in W.A. Nos. 1757 and 1758 of 2019.

Course on that date) for quashing the list and direction to appoint the respondent to the post of Teacher Grade III (Level I) with all consequential benefits \u2013 Dismissed\u2013 Division Bench allowed the writ petition holding that the proviso to r.266(3) remained intact despite the substitution of r.266(3) by Notification dtd. 11.5.11 \u2013 On appeal, held: Proviso was introduced for the first time on 1.7.04 \u2013 By virtue of the amendment dtd. 28.6.06, the qualifications in clause (3) of r.266 came to be changed and new qualifications came to be introduced \u2013 Fact that the proviso had ceased to exist as a result of the said substitution is unambiguously demonstrated by the fact that the rule making authority issued notification dtd. 29.11.06, by again inserting the proviso to r.266(3) \u2013 Thereafter again on 11.5.11, r.266(3) came to be substituted \u2013 Qualifications as stipulated by National Council for Teachers Education (NCTE) were inserted \u2013 Thus, r.266 (3) as was brought into life by the amending Act dtd. 28.6.06 continued to hold the field till it suffered substitution by notification dtd. 11.5.11 \u2013 Admittedly after 11.5.11, the proviso has not been brought back to life \u2013 Notification dtd. 29.11.06 bringing the proviso back to life after the substitution of clause (3) to r.266 in 2006 was not brought to the notice of the High Court\u2013 Further, the circular dtd. 29.2.12, replacing the requirement of the candidate possessing qualifications as on the last date, stipulated in the advertisement with the provisions of the proviso (though the proviso was not actually there), cannot be pressed into service by the respondent as the advertisement concerned in the present case is of the year 2013\u2013 Impugned judgment set aside \u2013 Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 \u2013 s.23 \u2013 Rajasthan Panchayati Raj (Fourth Amendment) Rules 2004 \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes.

Interpretation of statutes: Statutory rule of interpretation \u2013 Explanation of \u2013 Held: When in the definition clause a meaning is given to certain words then that meaning alone will have to be given to those words \u2013 However, when the definition clause contains the words \u2018means and includes\u2019 then both these words must be given the emphasis required and one word cannot override the other \u2013 Thus, the word \u2018means\u2019 indicates that the definition is exhaustive and complete \u2013 Word \u2018includes\u2019 enlarges the scope of the expression. Purposive construction of a statute \u2013 Principle of \u2013 Held: While giving a purposive interpretation, a court is required to place itself in the chair of the Legislature or author of the statute \u2013 Provision should be construed in such a manner to ensure that the object of the Act is fulfilled \u2013 If the language of the Act is clear then the language has to be followed, and the court cannot give its own interpretation \u2013 However, if the language admits of two meanings then the court can refer to the Objects and Reasons, to find out the true meaning."

Mutwalliship \u2013 Succession \u2013 Right of cognatic heirs of waqif \u2013 Held: For hereditary succession to mutwalliship cognatic heirs cannot be excluded as they are also included as descendants of the deceased under muslim law, though considered a more distant class of heirs than agnatic heirs \u2013 In order to establish claim for such succession, intention of the waqif, as manifested either through the directions given in the waqf deed or the creation of a custom is of paramount importance \u2013 In the facts of the present case it is evident that the waqif did not intend to exclude the cognatic heirs to succeed to mutwalliship."

Practice & Procedure \u2013 Claim of the plaintiff based on illegal agreement \u2013 Defendant also participator in the illegality \u2013 Grant of relief in such cases \u2013 Suit property granted under the 1961 Act in favor of the predecessor-in-title of the appellants-defendants, with non-alienation clause of 15 years \u2013 In violation of the Act, he executed agreement to sell dtd. 15.05.90 in favour of the plaintiff-respondents(s) \u2013 Suit for specific performance of the contract filed inter alia contending that the defendants did not come forward to execute the sale deed \u2013Trial court held that the the suit was not maintainable \u2013 Reversed by the first appellate court \u2013 Upheld by the High Court \u2013 Held: Both the parties are common participator in the illegality\u2013 Relying on Immani Appa Rao case, if the decree is granted in favour of the plaintiff on the basis of an illegal agreement hit by a statute, it will be rendering an active assistance of the court in enforcing an agreement contrary to law \u2013 As against this, if the balance is tilted towards the defendants, they would stand benefited even in spite of their predecessor-in\u0002title committing an illegality \u2013 However, what the court would be doing is only rendering an assistance which is purely of a passive character \u2013 First course would be patently inconsistent with the public interest whereas, the latter course is lesser injurious to public interest than the former \u2013 Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 \u2013 Equity."

Delhi School Education Rules, 1973 \u2013 r.105 \u2013 \u201cby another year\u201d \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: The plain reading of the words \u201cby another year\u201d implies that the appointing authority of an institution may extend the period of probation by one additional year over and above the mandatory year of probation with the prior approval of the Director \u2013 R.105(1) of the 1973 Rules, therefore, stipulates a limitation on the total probationary period to two years \u2013 The first proviso stipulates that the prior approval of the Director shall not be required in the case of a minority institution. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Ordinary and literal construction of the words \u2013 Held: It is a settled position of law that where the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless the interpretation leads to an absurd result \u2013 It is only where the language of a statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a manifest contradiction, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injustice, that a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Objective of a proviso \u2013 Held: It is a settled position of law that the objective of a proviso is to carve out from the main section a class or category to which the main section does not apply \u2013 A proviso must prima facie be read and considered in relation to the principal matter to which it is a proviso \u2013 It is not a separate or independent enactment."

Constitution of India: Art.14 \u2013 Notification issued by State Government for compulsory execution of bond at the time of admission of candidates to post-graduate courses and super specialty courses providing that they shall serve the State Government for certain stipulated period on successful completion of courses failing which they will be liable to recompense the State Government \u2013 Whether violated fundamental rights and is arbitrary \u2013 Held: Running medical colleges with post-graduate and super speciality courses requires huge infrastructure \u2013 However, the amount of fees charged from the students is meagre in comparison to the private medical colleges \u2013 The doctors are to paid reasonable stipend \u2013 Government hospitals run by the State are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life \u2013 Failure on the part of a Government hospital to provide timely medical treatment to a person in need of such treatment results in violation of his right guaranteed under Art.21 of the Constitution \u2013 Consequently, a policy decision taken by the State Governments to utilize the services of doctors who were beneficiaries of Government assistance to complete their education cannot be termed arbitrary. Constitution of India: Art.14 \u2013 Notifications issued by the State Governments imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause \u2013 Reasonableness of \u2013 Held: Notifications imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause are per se not unreasonable \u2013 However, the period of compulsory service and the exit should be reasonable \u2013 State Governments and Armed Forces Medical College are directed to consider imposing the condition of compulsory service period of two years in default of which the Doctors would recompense the Government by paying Rs. 20 Lakhs. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(g), 19(6) \u2013 Right to life and liberty \u2013 Right to take decisions relating to profession \u2013 According to the Appellants, the right to carry on their profession guaranteed by Art.19(1)(g) is violated by the compulsory bonds and that any restriction on their right to carry on their profession by the State Government can be made only by a \u201claw\u201d as per Art. 19(6) of the Constitution \u2013 Held: The compulsory bond executed by the Appellants is at the time of their admissions into post-graduate and super speciality courses \u2013 Conditions imposed for admission to a medical college will not directly violate the right of an individual to carry on his profession \u2013 The right to carry on the profession would start on the completion of the course \u2013 At the outset, there is no doubt that no right inheres in an individual to receive higher education \u2013 Violation of a right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) does not arise in a case pertaining to admission to a college \u2013 The condition that is imposed has a connection with the professional activity of a doctor on completion of the course \u2013 However, the Appellants have, without any protest, accepted the admissions and executed the compulsory bonds \u2013 Appellants have not succeeded in their attempt of assailing the Notifications for being violative of Art.19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Constitution of India: Arts.21, 47 \u2013 Right to life \u2013 Art.21 imposes an obligation on the State to safeguard the right to life of every person \u2013 Preservation of human life is thus of paramount importance \u2013 The Government hospitals run by the State and the Medical Officers employed therein are duty bound to extend medical assistance for preserving human life \u2013 In a welfare State, it is the obligation of the State to ensure the creation and the sustaining of conditions congenial to good health \u2013 Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health. Constitution of India: Art.21 \u2013 Right to live with dignity \u2013 Right to life enshrined in Art.21 cannot be restricted to mere animal existence \u2013 It means something much more than just physical survival \u2013 The right to life includes the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it, namely, the bare necessaries of life such as adequate nutrition, clothing and shelter, and facilities for reading, writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms, freely moving about and mixing and commingling with fellow human beings \u2013 Dignity is the core which unites the fundamental rights because the fundamental rights seek to achieve for each individual the dignity of existence \u2013 The State\u2019s obligations are not satisfied solely by refraining from imposing limitations on the right to human dignity \u2013 State must also take action to protect human dignity and to facilitate its realization \u2013 The constitutional right to dignity is intended to ensure human beings\u2019 political and civil liberties as well as their social and economic freedoms. Constitution of India: Art.23 \u2013 Whether the conditions of the bond per se amount to \u2018forced labour\u2019 and thus violative of Art.23(1) \u2013 Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform \u2018forced labour\u2019, especially after they took an informed decision to avail the benefits of admission in government medical colleges and received subsidized education \u2013 By no means, the service rendered by the Appellants in Government hospitals would fall under the expression of \u2018forced labour\u2019 \u2013 Art.23(2) enables the State Governments to require the Appellants to do compulsory service in the Government hospitals which is undoubtedly for the benefit of the public. Constitution of India: Art.47 \u2013 Right to health is integral to the right to life \u2013 Government has a constitutional obligation to provide health facilities \u2013 Art.47 reiterates the constitutional obligation imposed on the State to improve public health \u2013 It is for the State to secure health to its citizens as its primary duty \u2013 No doubt, the Government is rendering this obligation by opening Government hospitals and health centers, but in order to make it meaningful, it has to be within the reach of its people, as far as possible, to reduce the queue of waiting lists, and it has to provide all facilities to employ best of talents and tone up its administration to give effective contribution, which is also the duty of the Government \u2013 The immediate need of the deprived sections of the society to have proper health care is the reason behind the Government policy of imposing a condition of compulsory service and a default clause \u2013 The objective of the policy is to ensure that specialist health care is extended to the have-nots also \u2013 The right that is claimed by the Appellants is to make an individual choice to carry on their profession which might be hindered by the policy decision of the Government \u2013 On the other hand, the basic idea behind the Government\u2019s decision is larger public interest \u2013 Right to life guaranteed by Art.21 means right to life with human dignity \u2013 While balancing communitarian dignity vis-\u00e0-vis the dignity of private individuals, the scales must tilt in favour of communitarian dignity \u2013 The laudable objective with which the State Governments have introduced compulsory service bonds is to protect the fundamental right of the deprived sections of the society guaranteed to them under Art.21 \u2013 The contention of the Appellants that their rights guaranteed under Art.21 have been violated is rejected. Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.14 \u2013 Contract of Personal Service \u2013 Prohibition of specific performance of contract for personal service \u2013 Held: s.14 of the Specific Relief Act prohibits the enforcement of contracts of personal service \u2013 It is trite law that Courts do not ordinarily enforce performance of contracts of personal character, such as a contract of employment \u2013 None of the State Governments made an attempt to enforce the contracts entered into by them with the appellants through the service bonds \u2013 Constitution of India. Contract Act, 1872: s.27 \u2013 Restraint on Profession \u2013 Plea of the Appellants that compulsory bonds placed a restraint on their profession and thus, would be contrary to s.27 of the Contract Act \u2013 Held: A contract entered into by Appellants to serve the government for a few years under reasonable terms cannot be described as one in restraint of trade \u2013 The conditions of compulsory bonds for admission to post-graduate and super-Speciality courses in government medical colleges are not in violation of s.27 of the Contract Act \u2013 All the Doctors who have executed compulsory bonds shall be bound by the conditions contained therein \u2013 Taking note of the fact that certain State Governments have rigid conditions in the compulsory bonds to be executed by the Appellants and the felt need of uniformity in the matter pertaining to the compulsory bonds, suitable steps should be taken by the Union of India and the Medical Council of India to have a uniform policy regarding the compulsory service to be rendered by the Doctors who are trained in government institutions \u2013 Constitution of India."

Reservation Act, specific percentages of vacancies were reserved for different categories \u2013 It was brought to notice of State Government that there was wrongful calculation of category-wise vacancies in the earlier requisition and, therefore, the earlier requisition was required to be revised \u2013 State Government by order dated 20.08.2014, re-worked the vacancies for different categories of persons and sent the revised requisition for the vacancies for different categories to UP Public Service Commission (UPPSC) after adjustment of diploma holders against \u2018general category\u2019 \u2013 Based on revised requisition, UPPSC declared the result of written examination, wherein appellants as well as private respondents were declared successful \u2013 Thereafter, UPPSC issued O.M. dated 12.10.2014 specifically mentioning the number of vacancies to be filled up in various categories in consonance with order dated 20.07.2014 \u2013 Successful candidates appeared in interview on 27.10.2014 and finally result of select list candidates was declared on 21.05.2015 \u2013 Private respondents did not qualify \u2013 Unsuccessful candidates filed writ petitions before High Court challenging the validity of O.M. 12.10.2014 and the result declared on 21.05.2015 and praying for quashing the same and for preparation of result afresh without giving effect to O.M. 12.10.2014 \u2013 The impugned result was also assailed on the ground that it contravened s.3(1) of UP Reservation Act, 1994 and r.15(3) of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 and also that the percentage of reservation to SC/ST and OBC categories crossed the upper limit of 50% \u2013 Held: Revised requisition dated 20.8.2014 and OM dated 12.10.2014 was valid since it was only intended to rectify wrongful calculation of number of vacancies in different categories and to comply with requisite percentage of quota of reservation in different categories as per 1994 Act \u2013 By virtue of r.15 and r.6 of UP Subordinate Agriculture Services Rules, 1993 (Agriculture Service Rules, 1993), the Recruitment Authority is empowered to rectify the wrongful calculation and make a revised requisition of number of vacancies in different categories which is in accordance with the provisions of UP Reservation Act, 1994 \u2013 High Court was not right in saying that the diploma holders ought not to have been absorbed against the \u201cGeneral category\u201d so as to alter the advertised number of posts against the \u201cGeneral category\u201d \u2013 Absorption of diploma holders were required to be done only against the \u201cGeneral quota\u201d \u2013 Revising the number of vacancies in different categories to satisfy reservation quota scheme as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 would not amount to changing the rules of the game after the commencement of the selection process \u2013 Having participated in the interview and when they failed in the final selection, it was not open to the private respondents/intervenors to turn around and challenge the revised notification dated 12.10.2014 and the final select list dated 21.05.2015 \u2013 The filling up of the unfilled horizontal reservation by the candidates from the respective vertical reservation is in accordance with the policy of the government and the same cannot be faulted with \u2013 Uttar Pradesh Public Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994. Service law: Selection process \u2013 Reservation scheme \u2013 Appointment letter not issued to 906 candidates \u2013 Plea to exercise power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India \u2013 The 906 candidates were not issued the appointment orders in order to keep the appointment within the permissible percentage of reservation as per UP Reservation Act, 1994 \u2013 These 906 candidates who were left out and were not issued appointment orders were ranked lower in the merit list than the last selected candidate in their respective category under the reservation limit as identified by the Personnel Department, therefore appointment orders were not issued to them \u2013 This cannot be said to be arbitrariness or discrimination as selection of candidates was on the basis of the merit list \u2013 Therefore, power under Art.142 of the Constitution of India cannot be exercised to issue direction to the State to issue appointment orders to 906 candidates \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.142. Service law: Selection process \u2013 It is a settled law that a person having consciously participated in the interview cannot turn around and challenge the selection process \u2013 Having appeared in the interview without any demur or protest, it is not open to the candidates to challenge the selection process on the ground that there was modification in the number of vacancies in different categories and they are estopped by the principle of estoppel from challenging the same \u2013 Doctrine of estoppel. Service law: Selection process \u2013 It is fairly well-settled that the selected candidates do not have any indefeasible right to be appointed \u2013 Merely because the names of candidates were included in the provisional select list, they do not acquire any indefeasible right to be appointed.

State of Maharashtra reported as [2018] 4 SCR 877, while dealing with the 1989 Act issued guidelines inter alia viz.- (iii) in view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest under the 1989 Act, arrest of public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority and in case of non-public servant after approval by the S.S.P; (iv) preliminary inquiry by Dy.S.P to find out whether allegations make out a case under the 1989 Act and that the same are not frivolous/motivated \u2013 Review of \u2013 Held: As the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long; protective discrimination has been envisaged u/Art.15 and the 1989 Act to make them equals \u2013 Offences under the 1989 Act are cognizable \u2013 Impugned directions put riders on the right to arrest \u2013 It is not open to the legislature to put members of SCs and STs in disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis others and in particular to so\u0002called upper castes/general category \u2013What legislature cannot do legitimately, cannot be done by the interpretative process by the courts \u2013 For lodging false report, the caste of person is not the cause \u2013 It is due to the human failing and not due to the caste factor \u2013 There may be certain false cases and that can be ground for interference by the Court u/s.482, CrPC, but the law cannot be changed due to such misuse \u2013More than 47,000 cases were registered in 2016 under the 1989 Act \u2013Number is alarming, and it cannot be said that it is due to the misuse of the Act \u2013 To say that report lodged by an SC/ST would be registered only after preliminary investigation by Dy. S.P, whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith, would mean that report by upper-caste has to be registered immediately and arrest be made forthwith and thus, would be opposed to the protective discrimination meted out to the members of the SCs and STs as envisaged u/Arts.15, 17 & 21\u2013 Guidelines (iii), (iv) appear to have been issued in view of the provisions of s.18, 1989 Act, whereas adequate safeguards have been provided by purposive interpretation by Supreme Court in State of M.P. v. R.K. Balothia [1995] 1 SCR 897 \u2013 Permission of the appointing authority to arrest public servant is not at all statutorily envisaged and amounts to mandate having legislative colour which is a field not earmarked for the Courts \u2013 If at the threshold, approval of appointing authority is made necessary for arrest, the very purpose of the Act is likely to be frustrated \u2013 Various complications may arise\u2013 Further, in case of non-public servant requiring the approval of SSP for the arrest of accused could not have been made sine qua non, as it may delay the matter \u2013 As the approval of arrest by appointing authority/S.S.P. have not been approved, the direction to record reasons and scrutiny by Magistrate consequently stands nullified \u2013 Direction nos.(iii), (iv) issued by Supreme Court recalled \u2013 Consequently, direction no.(v) also vanishes \u2013Constitution of India\u2013 Arts.15, 17, 21 and 142 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013ss. 2(c), 41, 197, 438 & 482\u2013 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 \u2013 r.7(2) \u2013 Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Rules, 2016. Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 \u2013s.18 \u2013 Held: Provision of s.18 cannot be said to be violative of Art.21 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21. Constitution of India \u2013 Art.142 \u2013 Exercise of powers under \u2013 Impugned guidelines/directions issued by the Supreme Court in Dr. Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra reported as [2018] 4 SCR 877, inter alia directing that under the 1989 Act, arrest of public servant can only be after approval of the appointing authority; in case of non-public servant after approval by the S.S.P and also for a preliminary inquiry by Dy.S.P to find out whether allegations make out a case under the Act and that the same are not frivolous/ motivated \u2013 Held: Directions encroach upon the field reserved for the legislature and are against the concept of protective discrimination in favour of down-trodden classes u/Art.15(4) and also impermissible within the parameters laid down by Supreme Court for exercise of powers u/Art.142 \u2013 Impugned directions recalled \u2013 Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.
