Interpretation of Statutes \u2014 Rule of harmonious construction \u2014 Held: Rule of harmonious construction must be given effect to as far as possible \u2014 When the provisions of two statutes are irreconcilable, it needs to be decided as to which provision must be given effect to \u2014 There is a clear conflict between the proviso of s. 2(00) of the OEA Act, 1951 and ss. 5 and 33 of the Temple Act, 1955 \u2014 Section 2(00) proviso in its entirety is not violative of the provisions of the \u2014 Temple Act \u2014 Only the first part of the proviso is in contravention of the Temple Act, 1955, and to that extent is struck down and both the provisions would be able to operate. Judgment \u2014 When per incuriam \u2014 Held: Judgment can be said to be per incuriam when it is passed in forgetfulness or ignorance of a statute operating in that field \u2014 Decision of this Court in the case of *Lord Jagannath, wherein this Court upheld the validity of the notification dated 18.03.1974 in so far as it pertains to the estate of Lord Jagannath is per- ncuriam for non-consideration of the provisions of ss. 9 and 33 of the Temple Act, 1955. Doctrines / Principles \u2014 Doctrine of stare decisis \u2014 Is crucial to maintain judicial discipline \u2014 Decisions rendered in ignorance of existing statutes and law laid down by this Court cannot bind subsequent Benches of this Court.

Export / Import \u2014 Export Import (EXIM) Policy \u2014 EXIM Policy 2004-2009 \u2014 Target Plus Scheme (TPS) \u2014 Constitutional validity of Notification No. 48/2005 dated February 20, 2006 and Notification No. 8/2006 dated June 12, 2006 by which certain amendments were made in the EXIM Policy \u2014 Held: TPS introduced in EXIM Policy 2004- 2009 on August 31, 2004, adopted some of the features of the earlier Schemes in the EXIM Policy 2002-2007 and | introduced the concept of Muiti-Entitlement Rates, thus, allowing higher entitlement rates for higher growth \u2014 If the Government realised afterwards that export of certain items should not have been given the benefit of TPS and extending the benefit to now excluded items was an ill-considered move, _ though the Central Government was free to withdraw it in respect of such items but it could do so only prospectively, but was not entitled to do so with effect from the back date, Le. April 01, 2005, by taking away the vested right that had already accrued in favour of exporters of these items \u2014 Accordingly, on facts, Notification No. 48/2005 dated February 20, 2006 and Notification No. 8/2006 dated June _ 12, 2006 cannot be applied retrospectively and they would be effective only from the dates they were issued ~ Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992 \u2014 s.5. Export / Import \u2014 Export Import (EXIM) Policy \u2014 Incentive scheme \u2014 Held: It is for the Government to take the decision to grant such a privilege or not \u2014 Also such exemptions, concessions or incentives can be withdrawn any time - All these matters are in the domain of policy decisions of the Government \u2014 When there is withdrawal of a incentive and it is also shown that the same was done in public interest, the Court would not tinker with these policy decisions \u2014 administrative Law \u2014 Administrative policy \u2014 Foreign Trade Jevelopment and Regulation) Act, 1992. Administrative Law \u2014 Executive action relating to economic activities \u2014 Validity of - Held: In complex economic atters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based n experimentation or what one may call trial and error 1ethod and therefore its validity cannot be tested on any gid prior considerations or on the application of any straight-jacket formula.

No. 255 of 1984 and O.S. No, 39 of 1993 \u2014 Since neither the reliefs claimed in the two suits were identical, nor the parties were the same and nor could the decision in the first suit said to have been on merits, it cannot be held in the singular facts and circumstances that the suit in O.S No. 39 of 1993 was barred by res judicata. s.80 \u2014 Notice under, if necessary when suit filed against a Municipality \u2014 Held: Municipal council is not a public officer, and no notice is necessary when a suit is filed against a municipality - The question of sufficiency of notice u/s.80 of CPC does not arise at all.
