\u2013 Anti-Corruption Code \u2013 Article 3.1 \u2013 Whetherthe Disciplinary Committee has rightly placed burden of proof onthe appellant whereas according to Anti-Corruption Code underArticle 3.1, the burden of proof was on the designatedAnti-Corruption Official and whether by wrongly placing theburden of proof the Disciplinary Committee has erred in recordingits conclusion \u2013 Held: Article 3.1 deals with burden of proof andstandard of proof \u2013 The initial burden of proof is on the DesignatedAnti-Corruption Official i.e. Disciplinary Committee which has to form its opinion about the commission of designated offences bythe delinquent \u2013 Before taking the decision when show-causenotice is served on the appellant making allegations and referringto relevant materials in support of the said allegation, it wasincumbent on the appellant to have satisfactorily explained eachand every circumstances or evidence referred to and relied \u2013 Whenthe explanation submitted by the appellant was not foundsatisfactory, he having not been able to satisfactorily explain theallegations which were noticed from the telephone conversationbetween the appellant and the bookie, it cannot be said that theburden of proof was wrongly placed on the appellant \u2013 Initialburden as referred to in Article 3.1 stood discharged when theallegation referring to materials and evidence are communicated todelinquent \u2013 Standard of proof as referred to in Article 3.1 is thatthe BCCI Disciplinary Committee is to be comfortably satisfied,bearing in mind the seriousness of the allegation that is being made,that the alleged offence has been committed \u2013 Of course, on meredoubt the Disciplinary Committee cannot hold offences proved, therehas to be a positive evidence and finding regarding the proof ofoffences \u2013 The burden of proof was not wrongly placed on theappellant.Cricket: BCCI \u2013 Anti-Corruption Code \u2013 Burden of proof,standard \u2013 The standard of proof in a disciplinary inquiry and in atrial of a criminal case are entirely different \u2013 In a criminal case itis essential to prove a charge beyond all reasonable doubt whereasin disciplinary inquiry under Anti-Corruption Code of BCCI thepreponderance of probability is to serve the purpose.Cricket: BCCI \u2013 Anti-Corruption Code \u2013 Criminal case \u2013Discharge of appellant from the criminal case \u2013 Whether thedischarge order has any effect on the disciplinary proceeding ofBCCI under Anti-Corruption Code \u2013 Held: There is a vastdistinction in the scope of inquiry between a criminal trial on onehand and disciplinary inquiry against a public servant ordisciplinary inquiry under Anti-Corruption Code of BCCI on otherhand \u2013 The question before the Sessions Court was whether theappellant was guilty of offences under the criminal statutes \u2013Sessions Court had not to deal with the question whether theappellant was guilty of violating Anti-Corruption Code of BCCI \u2013 The clauses which the appellant breached under theAnti-Corruption Code of BCCI were entirely different from theoffences under which the appellant had been charged before theSessions Court \u2013 The ingredients required to establish a breach ofthe BCCI Code are also distinct and separate from the ingredientsrequired to prove offences under the penal statutes \u2013 Theconclusions and observations as recorded in the disciplinaryproceedings under Anti-Corruption Code were entirely different fromproof of criminal charges which are on higher yardstick to prove \u2013Thus, the discharge order had no effect on the disciplinaryproceeding of BCCI under Anti-Corruption Code.Cricket: BCCI \u2013 Anti-Corruption Code \u2013 Imposition ofmaximum sanction of life time ban by Disciplinary Committee oncharges under Article 2.1.1 to 2.1.4 of the Anti-Corruption Code \u2013Propriety of \u2013 Held: Sanction under Article 6 of Anti-CorruptionCode of BCCI is nothing but punishment on commission of theoffences and akin to sentencing in criminal jurisprudence \u2013 Theprinciples of sentencing as applicable in offence under the IndianPenal Code may not be strictly applicable to one of punishment/sanction under the Anti-Corruption Code but principles of sentencingas applicable in the criminal jurisprudence may be relevant forimposing sanction under the Anti-Corruption Code \u2013 In cases whereoffences under Article 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 are proved, theDisciplinary Committee is not obliged to award a life time ban in allcases where such offences are proved \u2013 When range of ineligibilitywhich is minimum five years, maximum life time ban is provided for,the discretion to which, either minimum or maximum or in betweenhas to be exercised on relevant facts and circumstances \u2013 No doubt,Anti-Corruption Code of BCCI envisages zero tolerance tocorruption \u2013 However, zero tolerance approach cannot diluteconsideration of relevant factors while imposing sanction underArticle 6 \u2013 Disciplinary Committee\u2019s order did not advert to theaggravating and mitigating factors as enumerated in Articles 6.1.1and 6.1.2 \u2013 Without considering the relevant provisions ofAnti-Corruption Code, the Disciplinary Committee imposed a lifetime ban on the appellant which sanction was not in accordancewith the Anti-Corruption Code itself \u2013 Sentence/Sentencing. Disciplinary Committee: Constitution of \u2013 Propriety chal-lenged \u2013 Whether the constitution of Disciplinary Committee wasvitiated by including Shri Srinivasan as President who had alreadystepped down on 02.06.2013 resulting in vitiation of entireproceedings \u2013 Held: There was no legal impediment in ShriSrinivasan participating in the Disciplinary Committee in themeeting of 13.09.2013 as President \u2013 The appellant having not takenthis ground even in the grounds of appeal is not allowed toquestion the constitution of Disciplinary Committee at this stage.Administrative Law: Disciplinary proceedings \u2013 Judicialreview, scope of interference \u2013 Constitutional court in exercise ofjurisdiction of judicial review of disciplinary proceedings conductedunder the Code of Conduct framed by the BCCI to interfere onlywhen conclusions of the Disciplinary Committee are perverse orbased on no evidence \u2013 On appreciation of evidence, it is not openfor the High Court or Supreme Court to substitute its own opinionbased on the appreciation of material on record on the chargesproved \u2013 Cricket."

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 \u2013 ss. 14 and 15 \u2013 Held:s.15 of the Act provides power & jurisdiction, independent of s.14thereof \u2013 Further, s.14(3) juxtaposed with s.15(3) of the Act, areseparate provisions for filing distinct applications before the Tribunalwith distinct periods of limitation, thereby amply demonstrating thatjurisdiction of the Tribunal flows from these Sections (i.e. s. 14 ands.15 of the Act) independently \u2013 The limitation provided in s.14 is aperiod of 6 months from the date on which the cause of action firstarose and whereas in s.15 it is 5 years \u2013 Therefore, the legislativeintent is clear to keep s.14 and s.15 as self-contained jurisdictions."
