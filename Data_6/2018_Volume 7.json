Nariman, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Examination of s.377 on the anvilof Art.19(1)(a) of the Constitution \u2013 Held: s.377 amounts to anunreasonable restriction, for public decency and morality cannotbe amplified beyond a rational or logical limit and cannot beaccepted as reasonable grounds for curbing the fundamental rightsof freedom of expression and choice of the LGBT community \u2013Consensual carnal intercourse among adults, be it homosexual orheterosexual, in private space, does not in any way harm the publicdecency or morality \u2013 Therefore, s.377 in its present form violatesArt.19(1)(a) of the Constitution. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI [for himselfand Khanwilkar, J.])Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Miniscule population of LGBT \u2013The mere fact that the percentage of population whose fundamentalright to privacy is being abridged by the existence of s.377 in itspresent form is low does not impose a limitat ion upon theConstitutional court from protecting the fundamental rights of those who are so affected by s.377. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI [for himselfand Khanwilkar, J.])Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.375 and s.377 \u2013 Distinction between \u2013The major difference between the language of s.377 and s.375 isthat of the element of absence consent which has been elaboratelyincorporated in the seven descriptions contained in the latter partof s.375 \u2013 It is the absence of willful and informed consent embodiedin the seven descriptions to s.375 which makes the offence of rapecriminal \u2013 On the other hand, s.377 contains no such descriptions/exceptions embodying the absence of willful and informed consentand criminalises even voluntary carnal intercourse both betweenhomosexuals as well as between heterosexuals. (Per Dipak Misra,CJI [for himself and Khanwilkar, J.])Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Expression \u2018against the order ofnature\u2019 \u2013 Held: Sex, if performed differently, as per the choice ofthe consenting adults, does not per se make it against the order ofnature \u2013 It is the freedom of choice of two consenting adults toperform sex for procreation or otherwise and if their choice is thatof the latter, it cannot be said to be against the order of nature.(Per Dipak Misra, CJI [for himself and Khanwilkar, J.])Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 History of s.377 \u2013 Laws in UnitedKingdom and in United States, Discussed. (Per R.F. Nariman, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Held: s.377was the product of the Victorian era, with its attendant puritanicalmoral values \u2013 Victorian morality must give way to constitutionalmorality \u2013 Constitutional morality is the soul of the Constitution,which is to be found in the Preamble of the Constitution, whichdeclares its ideals and aspirations, and is also to be found in PartIII of the Constitution, particularly with respect to those provisionswhich assure the dignity of the individual \u2013 The rationale for s.377,namely Victorian morality, has long gone and there is no reason tocontinue with - as Justice Holmes said - a law merely for the sake ofcontinuing with the law when the rationale of such law has longsince disappeared \u2013 s.377, insofar as it applies to same-sexconsenting adults, demeans them by having them prosecuted insteadof understanding their sexual orientation and attempting to correctcenturies of the stigma associated with such persons. (Per R.F.Nariman, J.) Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Discrimination grounded onstereotypes \u2013 Held: s.377 is the basis of persecution of members ofthe LGBT community \u2013 The section rests on deep rooted genderstereotypes \u2013 It perpetuates notions of morality which prohibit certainrelationships as being against the \u2018order of nature\u2019 \u2013 A criminalprovision has sanctioned discrimination grounded on stereotypesimposed on an entire class of persons on grounds prohibited byArt.15(1) \u2013 This constitutes discrimination on the grounds only ofsex and violates the guarantee of non-discrimination in Art.15(1) \u2013Constitution of India \u2013 Art.15(1). (Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Denial of sexual orientation isalso a denial of the right to privacy \u2013 To deny the members of theLGBT community the full expression of right to sexual orientation isto deprive them of their entitlement to full citizenship under theConstitution \u2013 By penalising sexual conduct between consentingadults, s.377 imposes moral notions which are anachronistic to aconstitutional order \u2013 While ostensibly penalising \u2018acts\u2019, it impactsupon the identity of the LGBT community and denies them the benefitsof equal citizenship \u2013 s.377 is based on a stereotype about sex \u2013Our Constitution which protects sexual orientation must outlaw anylaw which lends the authority of the state to obstructing itsfulfilment\u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21. (Per Dr. D.Y.Chandrachud, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Creation of a class of criminals \u2013Held: Although s.377 prima facie appears to criminalise certainacts or conduct, it creates a class of criminals, consisting ofindividuals who engage in consensual sexual activity \u2013 It typecastsLGBTQ individuals as sex-offenders, categorising their consensualconduct on par with sexual offences like rape and child molestation\u2013 s.377 not only criminalises acts (consensual sexual conductbetween adults) which should not constitute crime, but alsostigmatises and condemns LGBTQ individuals in society. (PerDr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 Import and effect \u2013 Held: Whilea consensual heterosexual relationship is permissible, a consensualrelationship between LGBT persons is considered to be \u2018carnal\u2019,and against the order of nature \u2013 s.377 creates an artificialdichotomy \u2013 The natural or innate sexual orientation of a person cannot be a ground for discrimination \u2013 Where a legislationdiscriminates on the basis of an intrinsic and core trait of anindividual, it cannot form a reasonable classification based on anintelligible differentia \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Reasonableclassification. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 In contemporary civi lisedjurisprudence, with States increasingly recognising the status ofsame-sex relationships, it would be retrograde to describe suchrelationships as being \u2018perverse\u2019, \u2018deviant\u2019, or \u2018unnatural\u2019. (PerIndu Malhotra, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.375 and 377 \u2013 While s.375 permitsconsensual penetrative acts (the definition of \u2018penetration\u2019 includesoral and anal sex), s.377 makes the same acts of penetrationpunishable irrespective of consent \u2013 This creates a dichotomy inthe law \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 History owes an apology to themembers of LGBT community and their families, for the delay inproviding redressal for the ignominy and ostracism that they havesuffered through the centuries \u2013 The members of this communitywere compelled to live a life full of fear of reprisal and persecution\u2013 This was on account of the ignorance of the majority to recognisethat homosexuality is a completely natural condition, part of a rangeof human sexuality. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377 \u2013 s.377, insofar criminalising theconsensual sexual acts of adults in private, is violative of Arts.14,15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution \u2013 Such consent must be freeconsent, which is completely voluntary in nature, and devoid ofany duress or coercion \u2013 The declaration of the said reading downof s.377 shall not, however, lead to the re-opening of any concludedprosecutions, but can certainly be relied upon in all pending matterswhether they are at the trial, appellate, or revisional stages \u2013 Theprovisions of s.377 will continue to govern non-consensual sexualacts against adults, all acts of carnal intercouse against minors,and acts of beastiality. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Interpretation of Constitution \u2013Concept of transformative Constitutional ism \u2013 Held: TheConstitution would become a stale and dead testament without dynamic, vibrant and pragmatic interpretation \u2013 Constitutionalprovisions have to be construed and developed in such a mannerthat their real intent and existence percolates to all segments of thesociety \u2013 Our Constitution has been perceived to be transformativein the sense that the interpretation of its provisions should not belimited to the mere literal meaning of its words; instead they oughtto be given a meaningful construction which is reflective of theirintent and purpose in consonance with the changing times \u2013Transformative constitutionalism not only includes within its wideperiphery the recognition of the rights and dignity of individualsbut also propagates the fostering and development of an atmospherewherein every individual is bestowed with adequate opportunitiesto develop socially, economically and politically \u2013 Discriminationof any kind strikes at the very core of any democratic society \u2013When guided by transformative constitutionalism, the society isdissuaded from indulging in any form of discrimination so that thenation is guided towards a resplendent future \u2013 Lesbian, Gay,Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT). (Per Dipak Misra, CJI [forhimself and Khanwilkar, J.])Constitution of India \u2013 Constitutional morality \u2013 It is onlyconstitutional morality that can be allowed to permeate into theRule of Law \u2013 Constitutional morality embraces within its sphereseveral virtues, foremost of them being the espousal of a pluralisticand inclusive society \u2013 The concept of constitutional morality urgesthe organs of the State, including the Judiciary, to preserve theheterogeneous nature of the society and to curb any attempt by themajority to usurp the rights and freedoms of a smaller or minusculesection of the populace \u2013 Constitutional morality cannot be martyredat the altar of social morality \u2013 The veil of social morality cannotbe used to violate fundamental rights of even a single individual,for the foundation of constitutional morality rests upon therecognition of diversity that pervades the society. (Per Dipak Misra,CJI [for himself and Khanwilkar, J.])Constitution of India \u2013 Right to live with dignity \u2013 TheConstitution has ladened the judiciary with the very important dutyto protect and ensure the right of every individual including theright to express and choose without any impediments so as to enablean individual to fully realize his/her fundamental right to live with dignity \u2013 Sexual orientation is one of the many biological phenomenawhich is natural and inherent in an individual and is controlled byneurological and biological factors \u2013 The science of sexuality hastheorized that an individual exerts little or no control over who he/she gets attracted to \u2013 Any discrimination on the basis of one\u2019ssexual orientation would entail a violation of the fundamental rightof freedom of expression. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI [for himself andKhanwilkar, J.])Constitution of India \u2013 Intention of constitutional framers wasnever to grant protection of fundamental rights only to the majoritypopulation \u2013 If such had been the intention, then all provisions inPart III of the Constitution would have contained qualifying wordssuch as \u2018majority persons\u2019 or \u2018majority citizens\u2019 \u2013 Instead, theprovisions have employed the words \u2018any person\u2019 and \u2018any citizen\u2019making it manifest that the constitutional courts are under anobligation to protect the fundamental rights of every single citizenwithout waiting for the catastrophic situation when the fundamentalrights of the majority of citizens get violated. (Per Dipak Misra,CJI [for himself and Khanwilkar, J.])Constitution of India \u2013 Sexual privacy and autonomy \u2013 Rightto privacy enables an individual to exercise his or her autonomyaway from the glare of societal expectations \u2013 In a liberal democracy,recognition of the individual as an autonomous person is anacknowledgement of the State\u2019s respect for the capacity of theindividual to make independent choices \u2013 Autonomy and privacyare inextricably linked \u2013 Each requires the other for its full realization\u2013 Sexual choices are an essential attribute of autonomy. (PerDr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Choice of partner \u2013 The choice ofwhom to partner, the ability to find fulfilment in sexual intimaciesand the right not to be subjected to discriminatory behaviour areintrinsic to the constitutional protection of sexual orientation. (PerDr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Right to health \u2013 Impact of s.377 onright to health \u2013 The operation of s.377 denies consenting adultsthe full realization of their right to health, as well as their sexualrights \u2013 It forces consensual sex between adults into a realm offear and shame, as persons who engage in anal and oral intercourse risk criminal sanctions if they seek health advice \u2013 This lowers thestandard of health enjoyed by them and particularly by members ofsexual and gender minorities, in relation to the rest of society \u2013s.377 has had far-reaching consequences for this \u201ckey population\u201d,pushing them out of the public health system \u2013 Laws that criminalizesame-sex intercourse create social barriers to accessing healthcare,and curb the effective prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS \u2013Criminal laws are the strongest expression of the State\u2019s power topunish certain acts and behaviour, and it is, therefore, incumbentupon the State to ensure full protection for all persons, includingthe specific needs of sexual minorities \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377.(Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Constitutional morality \u2013 The verypurpose of fundamental rights chapter in the Constitution of Indiais to withdraw the subject of liberty and dignity of the individualand place such subject beyond the reach of majoritariangovernments so that constitutional morality can be applied by theSupreme Court to give effect to the rights among others of discreteand insular minorities. (Per R.F. Nariman, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Constitution morality \u2013 Held: TheConstitution assures to every individual the right to lead a dignifiedlife \u2013 It prohibits discrimination within society \u2013 LGBT individualsare equal citizens of India, that they cannot be discriminated againstand that they have a right to express themselves through their intimatechoices. (Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Constitution morality and publicmorality \u2013 Difference between \u2013 Held: Under a regime of publicmorality, the conduct of society is determined by popular perceptionsexistent in society \u2013 The continuance of certain symbols, labels,names or body shapes determine the notions, sentiments and mentalattitudes of the people towards individuals and things \u2013Constitutional morality, on the other hand, determines the mentalattitude towards individuals and issues by the text and spirit of theConstitution \u2013 It requires that the rights of an individual ought notto be prejudiced by popular notions of society \u2013 It assumes thatcitizens would respect the vision of the framers of the Constitutionand would conduct themselves in a way which furthers that vision \u2013Constitutional morality reflects that the ideal of justice is an overriding factor in the struggle for existence over any other notionof social acceptance. (Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 21 \u2013 Persons who arehomosexual have a fundamental right to live with dignity, which, inthe larger framework of the Preamble of India, will assure thecardinal constitutional value of fraternity \u2013 Such groups are entitledto the protection of equal laws, and are entitled to be treated insociety as human beings without any stigma being attached to anyof them \u2013 All government officials, including and in particular policeofficials, and other officers of the Union of India and the States, begiven periodic sensitization and awareness training of the plight ofsuch persons \u2013 LGBT \u2013 Homosexual. (Per R.F. Nariman, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14 \u2013 A classification whichdiscriminates between persons based on their innate nature, wouldbe violative of their fundamental rights, and cannot withstand thetest of constitutional morality \u2013 s.377 insofar as it criminalisesconsensual sexual acts between adults in private, is not based onany sound or rational principle, since the basis of criminalisationis the \u201csexual orientation\u201d of a person, over which one has \u201clittleor no choice\u201d \u2013 Further, the phrase \u201ccarnal intercourse againstthe order of nature\u201d in s.377 as a determining principle in a penalprovision, is too open-ended, giving way to the scope for misuseagainst members of the LGBT community \u2013 Thus, apart from notsatisfying the twin-test under Art.14, s.377 is also manifestlyarbitrary, and hence violative of Art.14 of the Constitution. (PerIndu Malhotra, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Art.15 \u2013 Term \u2018sex\u2019 as it occurs inArt.15, is not merely restricted to the biological attributes of anindividual, but also includes their \u201csexual identity and character\u201d\u2013 The prohibition against discrimination under Art.15 on the groundof \u2018sex\u2019 should, therefore, encompass instances where suchdiscrimination takes place on the basis of one\u2019s sexual orientation\u2013 The LGBT community is a sexual minority which has suffered fromunjustified and unwarranted hostile discrimination, and is equallyentitled to the protection afforded by Art.15. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21 \u2013 LGBT, sexual orientation of \u2013Impediment of s.377 IPC \u2013 When biological expression, be it an orientation or optional expression of choice, is faced withimpediment, albeit through any imposition of law, the individual\u2019snatural and constitutional right is dented \u2013 Such a situation urgesthe conscience of the final constitutional arbiter to demolish theobstruction and remove the impediment so as to allow the fullblossoming of the natural and constitutional rights of individuals \u2013Yogyakarta Principle. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI [for himself andKhanwilkar, J.])Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21 \u2013 Right to choose partner onthe basis of sexual orientation \u2013 Held: Sexual orientation is innateto a human being \u2013 It is an important attribute of one\u2019s personalityand identity \u2013 Homosexuality and bisexuality are natural variantsof human sexuality \u2013 LGBT persons have little or no choice overtheir sexual orientation \u2013 LGBT persons, like other heterosexualpersons, are entitled to their privacy, and the right to lead a dignifiedexistence, without fear of persecution \u2013 They are entitled to completeautonomy over the most intimate decisions relating to their personallife, including the choice of their partners \u2013 Such choices must beprotected under Art.21 \u2013 The right to life and liberty wouldencompass the right to sexual autonomy, and freedom of expression\u2013 s.377 insofar as it curtails the personal liberty of LGBT personsto engage in voluntary consensual sexual relationships with apartner of their choice, in a safe and dignified environment, isviolative of Art.21. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21 \u2013 Right to privacy \u2013 s.377 affectsthe private sphere of the lives of LGBT persons \u2013 It takes away thedecisional autonomy of LGBT persons to make choices consistentwith their sexual orientation, which would further a dignifiedexistence and a meaningful life as a full person \u2013 s.377 prohibitsLGBT persons from expressing their sexual orientation and engagingin sexual conduct in private, a decision which inheres in the mostintimate spaces of one\u2019s existence. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21 \u2013 Right to health \u2013 LGBT personsbeing a sexual minority have been subjected to societal prejudice,discrimination and violence on account of their sexual orientation\u2013 Since s.377 criminalises \u201ccarnal intercourse against the order ofnature\u201d it compels LGBT persons to lead closeted lives \u2013 As aconsequence, LGBT persons are seriously disadvantaged and prejudiced when it comes to access to health-care facilities \u2013 Thisresults in serious health issues, including depression and suicidaltendencies amongst members of this community. (Per Indu Malhotra, J.)Constitution of India \u2013 Art.32 \u2013 Duty of constitutional Courts\u2013 Held: It is expected from the courts as the final arbiter of theConstitution to uphold the cherished principles of the Constitutionand not to be remotely guided by majoritarian view or popularperception \u2013 The Court has to be guided by the conception ofconstitutional morality and not by the societal morality \u2013 Wheneverthe constitutional Courts come across a situation of transgressionor dereliction in the sphere of fundamental rights, which are alsothe basic human rights of a section, howsoever small part of thesociety, then it is for the constitutional Courts to ensure, with theaid of judicial engagement and creativity, that constitutional moralityprevails over social morality. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI [for himselfand Khanwilkar, J.])Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Doctrine of progressive realization andnon-retrogression \u2013 The rationale behind the doctrine of progressiverealization of rights is the dynamic and ever growing nature of theConstitution under which the rights have been conferred to thecitizenry \u2013 The State has an obligation to take appropriate measuresfor the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights\u2013 The doctrine of progressive realization of rights, as a naturalcorollary, gives birth to the doctrine of non-retrogression \u2013 As perthis doctrine, there must not be any regression of rights \u2013 Thedoctrine of non-retrogression sets forth that the State should nottake measures or steps that deliberately lead to retrogression on theenjoyment of rights either under the Constitution or otherwise \u2013The two doctrines lead to the irresistible conclusion that if the lawenunciated in Suresh Koushal\u2019s case is accepted, it would definitelytantamount to a retrograde step in the direction of the progressiveinterpretation of the Consti tution and denial of progressiverealization of rights \u2013 The observation was made in Suresh Koushalthat gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders constitute a veryminuscule part of the population \u2013 Suresh Koushal\u2019s view getswrongly embedded with the minuscule facet and assumes criminalityon the bedrock being guided by a sense of social morality \u2013 Itdiscusses about health which is no more a phobia and is further moved by the popular morality while totally ignoring the conceptsof privacy, individual choice and the orientation \u2013 Orientation, incertain senses, does get the neuro-impulse to express while seeingthe other gender \u2013 That apart, swayed by data, Suresh Koushal failsto appreciate that the sustenance of fundamental rights does notrequire majoritarian sanction \u2013 Thus, the ruling becomes sensitivelysusceptible \u2013 LGBT \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377. (Per Dipak Misra,CJI [for himself and Khanwilkar, J.])Judicial review \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Where the validity of the law iscalled into question, judicial review will extend to scrutinizingwhether the law is manifestly arbitrary in its encroachment onfundamental liberties \u2013 If a law discriminates against a group or acommunity of citizens by denying them full and equal participationas citizens, in the rights and liberties granted by the Constitution, itwould be for the Court to adjudicate upon validity of such a law.(Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Jurisprudence \u2013 Criminal Law Theories \u2013 \u2018Bentham\u2019sUtilitarian Theory\u2019 and \u2018The Harm Principle\u2019 \u2013 Discussed. (PerDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.)Maxim \u2013 The latin maxim \u2018cessant ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex\u2019,meaning when the reason for a law ceases, the law itself ceases is arule of law \u2013 Parliament has unequivocally declared that the earlierstigma attached to same-sex couples, as persons who are regardedas mentally ill, has gone for good \u2013 Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 \u2013Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377. (Per R.F. Nariman, J.)Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 \u2013 s.3 \u2013 Homosexuality, whethera mental disorder \u2013 Medical and scientific authority has nowestablished that consensual same sex conduct is not against theorder of nature and that homosexuality is natural and a normalvariant of sexuality \u2013 Parliament has provided legislativeacknowledgment of this global consensus through this enactment \u2013s.3 of the Act mandates that mental illness is to be determined inaccordance with \u2018nationally\u2019 or \u2018internationally\u2019 accepted medicalstandards \u2013 The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)by the World Health Organization is listed as an internationallyaccepted medical standard and does not consider non-peno-vaginalsex between consenting adults either a mental disorder or an illness\u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.377. (Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.) LGBT \u2013 Members of the LGBT community are entitled, as allother citizens, to the full range of constitutional rights includingthe liberties protected by the Constitution \u2013 Constitution of India.(Per Dr. D. Y. Chandrachud, J.)Legislation \u2013 Constitutional validity of a legislation \u2013 Whileassessing whether a law infringes a fundamental right, it is not theintention of the lawmaker that is determinative, but whether theeffect or operation of the law infringes fundamental rights.
