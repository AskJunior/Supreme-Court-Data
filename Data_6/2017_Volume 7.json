        ],
        "HeadNote": "Income Tax Act, 1961: s.139AA - Constitutionality of- s.139AA makes it compulsory for assessees to give aadhaar number - Constitutional validity of s.139AA challenged on the ground that since enrolment under Aadhaar Act is voluntary, it canno1 be made compulsory under the \u00b7 Income Tax Act - Held: The purpose for enrolment under the Aadhaar Act is to avail benefits of various welfare schemes etc. as stipulated in. s. 7 of.th.e Aadhaar Act - The purpose behind Income Tax Act, on the other hand, is entirely different - For achieving the purpose such as curbing black money, money laundering and tax evasion etc., if the Parliament chooses to make the provision mandatory under the Income Tax Act, the competence of the Parliament cannot be questioned on the ground that it is impermissible only because under Aadhaar Act, the provision is directory in nature - It is the prerogative of the Parliament to make a particular provision directory in one statute and mandatory/ compulsory in other - That by itself cannot be a ground to question the competence of the legislature - After all, Aadhaar Act is not a mother Act - Two laws, i.e., Aadhaar Act, on the one hand, and law in the form of s.139AA of the Act, on the other hand, are two different stand alone provisions/laws and validity of one cannot be examined in the light of provisions of other Acts - Thus, there is no conflict between the provisions of Aadhaar Act and s.139AA of Income Tax Act in as much as when interpreted harmoniously they operate in distinct fields - Legislation - Interpretation of statutes - Harmonious construction - Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act. C D E F 0 G s.139AA - Purpose of- Held: s.139AA is aimed at seeding Aadhaar with PAN - One of the main objectives is to de-duplicatePAN cards and to bring a situation where one person is not having more than one PAN card or a person is not able to get PAN cards in assumed/fictitious names - In such a scenario, if those persons who violate s. I 39AA of the Act without any consequence, the provision shall be rendered toothless - It is the prerogative of the Legislature to make penal provisions for violation of any law made by it - The B requirement of giving Aadhaar enrolment number to the designated authority or stating this number in the income tax returns is directly connected with the issue of duplicate/fake PANs - Therefore, it cannot be denied that there has to be some provision stating the consequences for not complying with the requirements of s. l 39AA of the Act, more particularly when these requirements are found as c not violative of Arts.14 and 19 - If Aadhar. number is not given, the said exercise may not be possible - Sub-section (1) of s. l 39AA stipulates that those who are not PAN holders, while applying for PAN, they are required to give Aadhaar number - At the same time, as far as existing PAN holders are concerned, since the impugned D provisions are yet to be considered on the touchstone of Art.21 of the Constitution, including on the debate around Right to Privacy and human dignity, etc. as limbs of Art.2I, till the said aspect of Art.2I is decided by the Constitution Bench a partial stay of the said proviso is necessary - Those who have already enrolled E themselves under Aadhaar scheme would comply with the requirement of sub-section (2) of s.l 39AA of the Act - However, those assessees who are not Aadhaar card holders and do not comply with the provision of s.139(2), their PAN cards be not treated as invalid for the time being - A person wJio is holder of PAN and if his PAN is invalidated, he is bound to suffer immensely in his day to F day dealings, which situation should be avoided till the Constitution Bench authoritatively determines the argument of Art.21 of the Constitution - Since this course of action is adopted, in the interregnum, it would be permissible for the Parliament to consider as to whether there is a need to tone down the effect of the said G proviso by limiting the consequences - However, at the same time, proviso to s. l 39AA(2) cannot be read retrospectively - Constitution of India - Art.21. s.139AA(2) proviso - Retrospective effect - Constitutionality of- Held: If failure to intimate the Aadhaar number renders PANvoid ab initio with the deeming provision that the PAN allotted would A be invalid as if the person had not applied for allotment of PAN would have rippling effect of unsettling settled rights of the parties - It has the effect of undoing all the acts done by a person on the basis of such a PAN - It may have even the effect of incurring other penal consequences under the Act for earlier period on the ground B that there was no PAN registration by a particular assessee - The rights which are already accrued to a person in law cannot be taken away - Therefore, proviso to sub-section (2) has to be read down to mean that it would operate only prospective. Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016: c Object of its enactment - Held: The Aadhaar Act is enacted to enable the Government to identify individuals for delivery of benefits, subsidies and services under various welfare schemes. Whether Aadhaar card scheme whereby biometric data of an D individual is collected violates- Right to Privacy and, therefore, is offensive of Art.21 of the Constitution - Held: This issue is pending before the Constitution Bench and is yet to be decided - In the process, the Constitution Bench is also called upon to decide as to whether Right to Privacy is a part of Art. 21 of the Constitution at E all - Final decision pending - Constitution of India - Art.21. Need to interconnect the databases - Linking PAN with Aadhaar/biometric information to prevent use of wrong PAN for high value transactions - Multiple methods of giving proofs of identity - There is no mechanism/system at present to collect the data available with each of the independent prooft of ID - Seeding F of existing PAN with Aadhaar is perceived as the best method, and the only robust method for de-duplication of PAN database."

Micheal Raj - Held: The decision in *E. Micheal Raj nowhere makes reference to Note 2 of notification dated 19.10.2001 and that the same may have some bearing on the issue under consideration - This decision also does not refer to entry no. 239 and the interplay between the various provisions alluded to earlier while noting the argument of the . respondents - The judgment, however, after quoting notification dated 19.10.2001 took note of the purpose for which Amendment Act of 2001 was brought into force and then proceeded to hold that to achieve the said purpose of rationalisation of the sentence structure, the purity of the narcotic drug from the recovery or seizure made from the offender would be a decisive factor - Considering the significance of the issues raised by the respondents and the grounds of challenge of the appellants/petitioners concerning the impugned notification, to observe judicial rectitude and in deference to the decisions, matter is referred to larger bench."

(Per Dipak Misra, J.) s.2(d)-Age - The statutes mentions \"child's\" mental disability and not an adult's - A reading of the Act as a whole in the light of the Statement of Objects and Reasons makes it clear that the intention of the legislator was to focus on children, as commonly understood F i.e. persons who are physically under the age of 18 years - The golden rule in determining whether the judiciary has crossed the Lakshman Rekha in the guise of interpreting a statute is really whether a Judge has only ironed out the creases that he found in a statute in the light of its object, or whether he has altered the material G of which the Act is woven - In short, the difference is the we/1- known philosophical difference between \"is\" and \"ought'\u00b7' - If the Judge adds something more than what there is in the statute by way of a supposed intention of the legislator and go beyond creative interpretation of legislation to legislating itself, he crosses the Lakshman Rekha and becomes a legislator, stating what the lawought to be instead of what the law is - A scrutiny of other statutes in pari materia would bring this into sharper focus - The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, brings into sharpfocus the distinction between \"mentally ill persons\" and \"minors\" - s.3(4)(a) of the 1971 Act again makes it clear that when \"the age of 18 years\" occurs in a statute, it has reference only to physical age - The distinction between a female who is a minor and an adult woman who is mentally ill is again brought into sharp focus by the statute itself - It must, therefore, be held that Parliament, when it made the 2012 Act, was fully aware of this distinction, and yet cho.se to protect only children whose physical age was below 18 years - A perusal of the provisions of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 would again show that a distinction is made between a mentally ill person and a minor - Similarly, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 maintains the selfsame distinction - A perusal of ss.2, 4, 9, 18 and 31 of 2016 Act would show that children with disabilities are dealt with separately and differently from persons with disabilities - As a contrast to the 2012 Act, the National Trust for Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act, I999 would make it clear that whichever person is affected by mental retardation, in the broader sense, is a \u00b7person with disability\" under the Act, who gets protection - A reading of the Objects and Reasons of the 1999 Act together with the provisions contained therein would show that whatever is the physical age of the person affected, such person would be a ''person with disability\" who would be governed by the provisions of the said Act - Conspicuous by its absence is the reference to any age when it comes to protecting persons with disabilities under the said Act - Thus, it is clear that viewed with the lens of the legislator, violence would be done both to the intent and the language of Parliament if the word \"mental\" is read into s.2(l)(d) of the 2012 Act. (Per R.F. 925 A B c D E F Nariman, J.) [Concurring] Interpretation of statutes - Purposive construction - There is G no quarrel over the proposition that while interpreting social welfare legislations, the method of purposive construction has to be adopted keeping in view the text and the context of the legislation, the mischief it intends to obliterate and the fundamental intention of the legislature - If the purpose is defeated, absurd result is arrived at. (Per Dipak Misra, J.)"
