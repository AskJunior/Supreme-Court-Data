No.646 dated 10\" July, 1979 issued by the State of Andhra Pradesh \u2014 Their contention that the claim of the petitioners to appear in the entrance test conducted for admission into the medical super-specialty courses was contrary to the scheme of the Presidential Order and the 1979 circular ~ Submission made by the petitioners that though Article 371-D of the Constitution of India makes special provisions for the State, yet that would not extend to cover reservations as regards the super-specialty courses where merit alone matters \u2014 Plea of petitioners that there cannot be reservation of any kind in respect of post.-graduate or super speciality courses - It was urged that the State of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana cannot apply the domicile test only to admit its own students and that too also in respect of 15% quota meant for non-local candidates - Held: The undivided State of Andhra Pradesh enjoys a special privilege granted to it under Article 371-D of the Constitution and the Presidential Order - A scheme has been laid down in the case of Dr. Pradeep Jain and the concept of percentage had undergone certain changes ...: In Reita Nirankari, the same three-Judge Bench clarified the position - However, in C. Surekha, the Court had expressed its view about the amendment of the Presidential Order regard being had to the passage of time and the advancement in the State of Andhra Pradesh - A hopeful observation was made in the case of Fazal Ghafoor that the Government of India and the State Governments shall seriously consider this aspect of the matter without delay and appropriate guidelines shall be evolved by the Indian Medical Council so as to keep the Super Specialities in medical education unreserved, open and free - The fond hope has remained in the sphere of hope though there has been a progressive change - The \u00b7said privilege remains unchanged, as if to compete with eternity- Therefore, this Court echoes the same feeling and reiterates the aspirations of others so that authorities can objectively assess and approach the situation so that the national interest can become paramount - This Court does not intend to add anything in this regard- Consequently, the writ petition as far as it pertains to the State of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, is dismissed "

Constitution of India, 1950 \u2014 Arts.142, 14 and 217 -\u2014 Powers under Art. 142 \u2014 Nature and extent of the power \u2014 Held: The plenary powers of Supreme Court enshrined in Art.142 of the Constitution for achieving complete justice is only an insignia of empowerment so that the constitutional guarantees are not reduced to mere ritualistic incantations -\u2014 Supreme Court extra-ordinarily does exercise its power _under Article 142 as warranted in a given fact situation, for making order (s) as is felt necessary for doing complete justice in a case a matter pending before it \u2014- There can be no straight jacket formula, for its exercise nor there can be any fetter thereto, it being plenary in nature \u2014 The invocation of this power is to reach injustice and redress the same, if it is not feasible otherwise to achieve this avowed objective \u2014 In doing so, this Court acts in its equity jurisdiction to balance the conflicting interests of the parties and advance the cause of administration of even handed justice \u2014 The purport and purpose of this power being justice oriented and guided by equitable principles, it chiefly aims at the enforcement of a _ public duty, if not forthcoming on legitimate justification ensuing in oppressive injustice, militating against the constitutional ordainment of. equality before law and equal protection of laws enshrined in Art. 14 of the Constitution and entrenched as are, among others, in the invaluable right to - life envisioned in Art. 21 of the Constitution.

Constitution of India, 1950 \u2014 Writ jurisdiction \u2014 Writ of mandamus \u2014 Features of \u2014 Held: The writ of mandamus is an extraordinary remedy and is intended to supply deficiencies in law and is thus discretionary in nature -The ~ issuance of writ of mandamus pre-supposes a clear right of \u00a9 the applicant and unjustifiable failure of a duty imposed on an authority otherwise obliged in law to imperatively discharge the same. Administrative Law \u2014 Administrative discretion ~ Held: Administrative discretion can never be unregulated, omnipotent and fanciful \u2014A public authority vested with power has to essentially exercise its discretion, if conferred, conditioned by the dictates of duty as envisaged, to effectuate the exercise of the prerogative to achieve the objective therefor \u2014 The central and cardinal canon of administrative governance, enjoins a framework of controlled use of discretion coupled with duty.

VI\u2014 European Community Council Regulation No. 1225 of 2009 dated 30.11.2009. International Law\u2014 Treaty obligations - How domestic legislation must be construed when it is made in furtherance of an international treaty - Held: (1) Article 51(c) of the Constitution is a Directive Principle of State Policy which States that the State shall endeavour to foster respect for international law and treaty obligations \u2014 As a result, rules of international law which are not contrary to domestic law are followed by the courts in this country \u2014 This is a situation in which there is an international treaty to which India is not a \u201csignatory or general rules of international law are made applicable \u2014 It is in this situation that if there happens to be a conflict between domestic law and international law, domestic law will prevail \u2014 (2) In a situation where India is a signatory nation to an international treaty, and a statute is passed pursuant to the said treaty, it is a legitimate aid to the construction of the provisions of such statute that are vague or ambiguous to have recourse to the terms of the treaty to resolve such ambiguity in favour of a meaning that is consistent with the provisions of the treaty \u2014 (3) In a situation where India is a signatory nation to an international treaty, and a statute is made in furtherance of such treaty, a purposive rather than a narrow literal construction of such statute is preferred ~ The interpretation of such a statute Should be construed on broad principles of general acceptance rather than earlier domestic precedents, being intended to carry out treaty obligations, and not to be inconsistent with them \u2014 (4) Ina situation in which India is a signatory nation to an international treaty, and a Statute is made to enforce a treaty obligation, and if there be any difference between the language of such statute and a corresponding provision of the treaty, the statutory language should be construed in the same sense as that of the treaty ~ This is for the reason that in such cases what is sought to be achieved by the international treaty is a uniform international code of law which is to be applied by the courts of all the signatory nations in a manner that leads to the same result in all the signatory nations ~ Directive Principle of State Policy \u2014 Constitution of India \u2014 Art.51(c).

        "HeadNote": " Registration Act, 1908 \u2014 s.69 - Jurisdiction of authorities under the Act \u2014A plot of land has been allotted to appellant's mother, by respondent no.4-Society \u2014 After death of appellant's mother, respondent no:4-society, through its office bearer executed a Deed of Extinguishment unilaterally cancelling the said allotment and on the strength of such document, executed a registered sale deed in favour of respondent no.5, who in turn executed a sale deed in favour of the respondent nos. 6 and 7\u2014 Appellant moved the Sub- Registrar (Registration) seeking cancellation of the Deed of Extinguishment \u2014 Sub-Registrar rejected the said prayer on two counts, namely, the dispute between the parties was pending before the competent authority under the M.P. Cooperative Societies Act and secondly, his jurisdiction was limited only to the extent of registering the documents and if any party desired its cancellation, then to verify that the cancellation deed is registered on appropriate stamp paper \u2014 Appellant filed application u/s.69 of the Registration Act, which was rejected by the Inspector General (Registration) stating that the powers conferred on him is limited to general superintendence of the registration office and making rules  _ > The Inspector General further intimated him that against the order of Sub-Registrar, it was open to the appellant to initiate appropriate proceedings before a Court of competent jurisdiction \u2014 Appellant filed writ petition praying for declaring the Extinguishment Deed as well as the subsequent sale deeds as void ab initio \u2014- High Court held that the controversy raised by the appellant could not be adjudicated in the writ proceeding; and that the authorities under the Act had correctly stated that they have no jurisdiction to decide the soundness of registration of Extinguishment Deed or the sale deeds and declare them as null and void \u2014 Whether the Deed of Extinguishment and the subsequent sale deeds registered by the Sub-Registrar under the Act could be cancelled by the Sub-Registrar or by his superior authority in exercise of powers conferred under the Act ~ Held (per Misra, J.): In Thota Ganga Laxmi case, the Supreme Court, after making reference to a specific rule, namely, Rule 26(k)(i) framed by the State of Andhra Pradesh u/s.69 of the Registration Act, opined that a cancellation deed cannot be executed or registered \u2014 Question that emerges for consideration is whether in the absence of any specific rule in the State of Madhya Pradesh, the general principle laid down in the case of Thota Ganga Laxmi would be applicable \u2014 In the absence of any rule, to opine that by no stretch of imagination can a cancellation deed be accepted or registered by the Registering Authority does not appear to be correct\u2014 Hence, the principle by way of general observations stated in Thota Ganga Laxmi case requires consideration by a larger Bench \u2014 Held (per Gowda, J.): High Court should have responsibly exercised its extraordinary jurisdiction and should have examined the documents of the sale deed with respect to the relevant provisions of the M.P Co-operative Societies Act and Rules, 1962 and the Bye-laws of the Society \u2014 The cancellation of the sale deed executed in favour of the appellant\u2019s mother in the year 1962 by way of the extinguishment deed could not have been registered by the Sub-Registrar as he is not empowered to do so \u2014 Hence, for want of the competent jurisdiction, in registering such document, the High Court should have exercised its extraordinary jurisdiction to annul the extinguishment deed and the transactions of the subsequent sale deeds, which has not been done by it\u2014 Thus, the High Court has failed to exercise its discretionary power which has resulted in a grave miscarriage of justice, thereby, depriving the valuable constitutional right guaranteed under Art.300A of the Constitution to the appellant \u2014 Order of the High Court accordingly set aside and the impugned instruments i.e. the extinguishment deed and the subsequent sale deeds quashed with further direction to respondent Nos.6 and 7 to vacate the.said property and hand over the possession of the same to the appellant - Respondents further directed to pay the appellant a compensation amount of Rs.10 Lakhs for his sufferings and the injustice caused to him by the society for the last 14 years as he was deprived of his right to enjoy the property on account of the arbitrary and unilateral _ action taken by the society in canceiling the sale deed in respect of the property in question executed in favour of his deceased mother \u2014 Held (per curiam): In view of the difference of opinion, matter directed to. be placed before Hon'ble the Chief Justice of India, for constituting appropriate Bench \u2014 M.P.

Dalal and Canara Bank Mutual Fund (CMF) as party respondents and to file claim against the said respondents (respondent nos. 2 to 10) in the alternative to the claim preferred by appellant against respondent no. 1 \u2014 The Special Court constituted under the 1992 Act came to the conclusion that appellant-  - SCB had succeeded in proving that they had purchased 17% taxable NPCL bonds; that Hiten P. Dalal had not succeeded in proving that he was the owner of the suit bonds, and that appellant-SCB was entitled to file a suit for conversion against Hiten P.

Dalal was effected on 20.10.1995 vide a Chamber Summons \u2014 The case of the appellant is that it was during a meeting held on 07.11.1992 that they first learnt that the suit bonds had been misappropriated by Hiten P. Dalal and given to CMF \u2014 It is manifestly clear from examination of the deposition of PW-3 and PW-4 that a meeting did in fact occur on 07.11.1992-\u2014 The Special Court erred in coming to the conclusion that no meeting occurred on 07.11.1992 \u2014A perusal of the record prepared by PW-3, makes it amply clear that it was during this meeting on 07.11.1992 that CMF first admitted to SCB regarding the dummy sale involving the 9% NPCL bonds and 17% NPCL bonds \u2014 Thus, a meeting did in fact take place in the office of CMF on 07.11.1992, and that it was on this date that appellant-SCB found out about the dummy transaction that had taken place between CMF and Hiten P. Dalal regarding the 9% and 17% NPCL bonds \u2014 The period of limitation would start running only on 07.11.1992 \u2014 The period of limitation according to Article 91(a) of the Limitation Act for filing a suit for compensation for conversion of property is three years from the date on which the person having the right to possession of the property learns in whose possession it is \u2014 Accordingly, finding of fact recorded by the Special Court that the suit was barred by limitation set aside \u2014 Appellant entitled for decree of suit claim of the principal amount adjudged as on the date of the institution of the suit\u2014 Appellant also entitled to interest pendente lite and future interest \u2014 This transaction can be termed as a commercial transaction and s.34 CPC confers discretionary power upon this Court . to award interest at appropriate rate on the suit claim of the appellant \u2014 The suit in the instant case was instituted before the Special Court on 27.11.1992, but the respondent nos. 2- 10 were brought on record as parties to the suit by way of an amendment, which was allowed on 10.01.1996\u2014 Therefore, | it would be appropriate to award interest from the above said date during pendency of the proceedings before the Special Court and this Court and also for future rate of interest at 6% per annum till the date of realisation \u2014 Respondent nos. 2-10 directed to pay the adjudged principal sum of | Rs. 50, 18,61, 250.00 along with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from 10.01.1996 till the date of realisation with suit costs throughout for having converted the suit bonds - The above respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the same to the appellant "
