Competition Act, 2002 \u2013 ss.2,4,18,19,27,41,53B, 53T and 60 \u2013 Role and Duty of Commission \u2013 Held: The Preamble of the Act, read with the ss. 2,4,18,19,27,41,53B,53T and 60 would show that the Commission set up by the Competition Act certainly has a positive role to play \u2013 A perusal of s.18 and s.19 would show that it is a positive duty of the Commission to eliminate all practices which have an adverse effect on competition \u2013 Further the Commission should promote and sustain competition, apart from protecting the interest of consumers, so as to ensure freedom of trade carried on by all participants in markets all over India \u2013 Also, a positive role is given to the Commission to inquire, suo motu, into the dominant position of enterprises, and to prohibit anti competitive agreements \u2013 S.60 then gives the Act overriding effect over other statutes in case of a clash between the Act and such statues to effectuate the policy of the Act, keeping in view the economic development of the country as a whole.

        "HeadNote": "Mines and Minerals: Mining leases \u2013 Renewal of \u2013 Propriety \u2013 Appointment of Commission of Inquiry, pursuant to information regarding large\u0002scale illegal mining in contravention of provisions of relevant laws \u2013 After the report of the Commission, Govt. of Goa by order dated 10.9.2012 suspended all the mining operations in the State \u2013 Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) kept in abeyance the environmental clearances in the State of Goa by order dated 14.9.2012 \u2013 PIL was filed by Goa Foundation in Supreme Court seeking directions to Governments of Union and State of Goa to take steps to terminate the mining leases where mining was carried out in violation of various statutes \u2013 Writ petitions by mining lease\u0002holders before High Court seeking quashing of the orders dated 10.9.2012 and 14.9.2012, were transferred to Supreme Court \u2013 Supreme Court in *Goa Foundation case held that orders dated 10.9.2012 and 14.9.2012 were not liable to be quashed and would continue till decisions are taken to grant fresh leases and fresh environmental clearances for mining projects \u2013 Other writ petitions were filed before High Court by several mining lease-holders for consideration of their applications for second renewal of mining leases \u2013 High Court held that the decision in *Goa Foundation case was not an impediment in considering the applications for second renewal; and that renewal of a lease is also a fresh grant \u2013 High Court directed the State to execute the lease deeds u/s. 8(3) of MMDR Act in favour of the lease-holders who have already paid the stamp duty in accordance with Mineral Policy 2013 \u2013 Further directed the State to decide the renewal applications u/s. 8(3), of those who had not paid the stamp duty \u2013 State of Goa thereafter formulated Goa Grant of Mining Leases Policy 2014 \u2013 Central Government prepared draft of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2014 (amended Act) and uploaded the same on the website \u2013 The proposed amendment inter alia by introducing s. 10B provided for competitive bidding \u2013 Soon thereafter and till the date of promulgation of Amendment Ordinance, State of Goa granted second renewals to several mining lease-holders \u2013 Thereafter, the State requested MoEF to lift the abeyance order (dated 14.9.2012) on environmental clearances \u2013 Consequently MoEF by orders dated 20.3.2015 lifted the abeyance order in respect of 72 cases out of 139 \u2013 Held: The decision of State of Goa to grant second renewal of mining leases was erroneous and contrary to decision in *Goa Foundation case \u2013 State was obliged to grant fresh mining leases as declaration in *Goa Foundation case was explicitly to grant fresh leases \u2013 Grant of fresh lease is not the same as renewal of lease \u2013 State was not under any constitutional obligation to grant fresh mining leases through process of competitive bidding or auction \u2013 However, the second renewals were unduly hasty, without taking into consideration all relevant material and ignoring relevant material, was not in the interest of mineral development \u2013 The decision of renewal was only to augment the revenues of the State which is outside the purview of s. 8(3) of 1957 Act \u2013 Therefore, the second renewal granted by the State is liable to be set aside \u2013 MoEF was obliged to grant fresh environmental clearance in respect of fresh grant of mining leases in accordance with law and decision in *Goa Foundation case and not by merely lifting the abeyance order dated 14.9.2012 \u2013 High Court proceeded on the erroneous basis that it could direct the State to grant second renewal notwithstanding the direction in *Goa Foundation case \u2013 Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act, 1957 \u2013 s.8(3) \u2013 Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 \u2013 Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Auction: Natural Resource allocation \u2013 Through auction method \u2013 Whether mandatory \u2013 Held: There is no constitutional or otherwise mandate for allocation of natural resources (other than spectrum) through auction method \u2013 But, auction process should not be given a go-bye without any justification \u2013 The decision to give a go-bye is judicially reviewable and would attract Art. 14 \u2013 Review is permissible only when the allocation is for commercial pursuits of profit de hors any social or welfare purpose \u2013 It will not be permissible if such allocation is for a social or welfare purpose \u2013 Judicial Review \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14. Judicial Review: Judicial review of policy decision \u2013 In respect of disposal of natural resources \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: Judicial review of a policy is kept open if it does not serve the common good as understood in Art. 39(b) and if violates Art. 14 \u2013 However, the courts must be very cautious and circumspect in diluting or setting aside a policy and must do so only if it is constitutionally unavoidable \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 14 and 39(b) \u2013 Administrative Law. Lease: Renewal of lease vis-a-vis grant of fresh lease \u2013 Held: Grant of a fresh lease is not the same as the renewal of a lease \u2013 Therefore, renewal cannot be called amounting to grant of fresh lease. Environmental Law: The issues having impact on the environment and the people of a community or a region or the State are required to be looked at holistically \u2013 One or two violations may be wished away as inconsequential, but multiple violations by several persons can result in serious problems."

Chartered Accountants Act, 1949: ss.25, 29 \u2013 Auditing \u2013 Role of auditor \u2013 Violation of statutory provisions by MAFs \u2013 Need for separate oversight body \u2013 Held: Failure of auditors have resulted into scandals in the past \u2013 Absence of adequate oversight mechanism results in infringing public interest and rule of law which are part of fundamental rights under Arts.14 and 21 \u2013 The issue of separate oversight body for auditing work and updating existing legal framework is necessary \u2013 Therefore, auditing profession requires proper oversight and such oversight mechanism needs to be revisited from time to time. Chartered Accountants Act, 1949: ss.25, 29 \u2013 Illegal operation by MAFs in India \u2013 Lifting of corporate veil \u2013 As found by the Expert Committee in its report, there is a compliance by MAFs only in form and not in substance, by having got registered partnership firms with the Indian partners, the real beneficiaries of transacting the business of chartered accountancy remain the companies of the foreign entities \u2013 The principle of lifting the corporate veil has to apply when the law is sought to be circumvented \u2013 Protection of public interest being of paramount importance, if the corporate personality is to be used to evade obligations imposed by law, the real state of affairs needs to be seen \u2013 The same principle applies while overseeing the compliance of applicable ethics of not permitting profit sharing or complying with the ceiling limit for the business which is violated by using the technique of sub contracts for outsourcing \u2013 If the premises are same, phone number/fax number is same, brand name is same, the controlling entity is same, human resources are same, it will be difficult to expect that there is full compliance on mere separate registration of a firm \u2013 The prohibition under s.25 of the CA Act can be held to be defeated. Administrative law: Expert body \u2013 ICAI \u2013 Allegation that members of ICAI lending their names to the MAFs who are nonmembers and enabling them to illegally operate in the field of Chartered Accountancy and sharing fees and profits with them \u2013 Held: Being an expert body, ICAI should examine the matter further to uphold the law and give a report to concerned authorities for appropriate action \u2013 Though the Committee analysed available facts and found that MAFs were involved in violating ethics and law, it took hyper technical view that non availability of complete information and the groups as such were not amenable to its disciplinary jurisdiction in absence of registration \u2013 A premier professionals body cannot limit its oversight functions on technicalities and is expected to play proactive role for upholding ethics and values of the profession by going into all connected and incidental issues \u2013 Thus, a case is made out for examination not only by ED and further examination by the ICAI but also by the Central Government having regard to the issues of violation of RBI/ FDI policies and the CA Act by secret arrangements \u2013 Benami Transactions \u2013 Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 \u2013 ss.25, 29."

Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 s.21A \u2013 Non-obstante clause \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Whether s.21A can be said to prevail over State Debt Relief Act in the event of a clash between the two \u2013 Held: So far as relief of agricultural indebtedness is concerned, where there is State legislation on the same subject matter which directly clashes with s.21A, s.21A will have to give way to the State Debt Relief Act insofar as relief from agricultural indebtedness due to banks is concerned \u2013 The non-obstante clause in s.21A cannot override a State Debt Relief Act in this situation, as Parliament cannot give itself supremacy over State legislation where none exists under the Constitution \u2013 If this were not the case, the exclusive power of the States to make laws within List II would become illusory, and \u201cParliamentary paramountcy\u201d would trap many a beneficent State legislation made within its exclusive domain. Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List II, Entry 30 \u2013 Interpretation of Entry 30 \u2013 The expression \u201crelief of agricultural indebtedness\u201d does not take colour from the expression \u201cmoney lending and money lenders\u201d preceding it in Entry 30 List II \u2013 The two expressions are separated by a semicolon which shows that they are not inextricably connected \u2013 Thus, money lending is not restricted to the agricultural sector but includes within its scope money lent to all person including purely commercial transactions \u2013 Interpretation of Constitution. Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List I, Entry 45 \u2013 Banking \u2013 Whether s.21A of Banking Regulation Act trenches upon Entry 30, List II \u2013 Held: In pith and substance, the Banking Regulation Act fall within Entry 45, List I, but insofar as relief of agricultural indebtedness is concerned, s.21A certainly trenches upon Entry 30, List II \u2013 Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 s.21A \u2013 Doctrine of pith and substance. Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List I, Entry 45; List II Entry 18 and 30 \u2013 Agricultural indebtedness, relief of agricultural indebtedness and banking \u2013 How they all fall under different Entries \u2013 Held: Qua the general entry \u201cbanking\u201d under Entry 45, List I, which deals with banks of all kinds and the lending by banks as well as recovery of debts by banks generally, Entry 30, List II, which deals with relief of agricultural indebtedness, is special, for the reason that indebtedness itself is only one species of banking and agricultural indebtedness is a sub-species thereof \u2013 The species of indebtedness is within Entry 45, List I, whereas the sub-species of agricultural indebtedness is within Entry 18, List II \u2013 It is only relief of agricultural indebtedness, which is a sub-sub-species of indebtedness, which is relatable to Entry 30, List II. Constitution of India \u2013 Art.246 \u2013 Federal supremacy \u2013 Doctrine of pith and substance \u2013 Doctrine of incidental trenching and unoccupied field \u2013 Once the spheres of both the entries i.e. State List Entry and Union List Entry have been delineated, the doctrine of pith and substance comes in to test whether a particular legislation is referable, as a whole, to an entry in List I or to the competing entry in List II \u2013 Once it is found that the legislation as a whole is referable to an entry in List I, but it incidentally encroaches upon an entry in List II, there is no reason for the doctrine of unoccupied field not to apply to federal legislation \u2013 The expression \u201cwith respect to\u201d appears in all the sub-articles of Art.246, which expression, so far as sub-articles (1) to (3) are concerned, imports the twin doctrines of incidental trenching and unoccupied field, which applies, therefore, to legislation made under sub-articles (1) to (3) of Art.246, thus making it clear that incidental encroachment by Parliament cannot be tolerated when the exclusive field allotted to the State legislature is not unoccupied \u2013The paramountcy principle contained in Art.246, is only taken as a last resort after harmonious construction fails, and, that too, qua entries in competing lists \u2013 Once legislation is referable to one list or the other, the doctrine of incidental trenching and unoccupied field would apply equally to both Parliamentary and State legislations. Interpretation of Constitution \u2013 Harmonious construction \u2013 How Entry 45 of List I and Entry 30 List II to be harmonized \u2013 Scope of Art.246 \u2013 Where two entries in Union List and State List are irreconcilable \u2013 Held: Art.246 only states that where two entries in the Union List and the State List, respectively, have a head-on collision and are irreconcilable, then, as a last resort, the entry in the State List is to give way to the entry in the Union List \u2013 But, this is only as a last resort \u2013 First, it is incumbent upon the Court to harmonize the entries, if possible, by giving effect to both and not rendering any one of them otiose \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.246 \u2013 Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 s.21A. Precedent \u2013 Binding effect \u2013 ratio decidendi \u2013 Where a matter is not argued at all by the respondent, and the judgment is one of reversal, it would be hazardous to state that the law can be declared on an ex parte appraisal of the facts and the law, as demonstrated before the Court by the appellant\u2019s counsel alone \u2013 That apart, where there is a detailed judgment of the High Court dealing with several authorities, and it is reversed in a cryptic fashion without dealing with any of them, the per incuriam doctrine kicks in, and the judgment loses binding force, because of the manner in which it deals with the proposition of law in question \u2013 Also, the ratio decidendi of a judgment is the principle of law adopted having regard to the line of reasoning of the Judge which alone binds in future cases \u2013 Such principle can only be laid down after a discussion of the relevant provisions and the case law on the subject \u2013 If only one side is heard and a judgment is reversed, without any line of reasoning, and certain conclusions alone are arrived at, without any reference to any case law, such a judgment would not be binding upon apex court \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.141 \u2013 Doctrine of per incuriam."

K. Goel, J. (for himself and Navin Sinha, J.) Order framing charge is not purely an interlocutory order nor a final order\u2013 Jurisdiction of High Court is not barred either u/s.397 or u/s.482, CrPC or u/Art.227 of the Constitution \u2013 However, the said jurisdiction is to be exercised consistent with the legislative policy to ensure expeditious disposal of a trial without the same being in any manner hampered \u2013 Thus, challenge to an order of charge should be entertained in a rarest of rare case only to correct a patent error of jurisdiction and not to re-appreciate the matter \u2013 Even where such challenge is entertained and stay is granted, the matter must be decided on day-to-day basis so that stay does not operate for an unduly long period \u2013 Though no mandatory time limit may be fixed, the decision may not exceed two-three months normally \u2013 Mandate of speedy justice applies to the PC Act cases as well \u2013 Per R. F. Nariman, J. (Concurring) Inherent power of a Court set up by the Constitution is a power that inheres in such Court because it is a superior court of record, and not because it is conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 Section 19(3)(c) cannot be read as a ban on the maintainability of a petition filed before High Court u/s.482,CrPC \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 21, 215, 226 and 227 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss.397(2), 482 \u2013 Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 \u2013Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952 \u2013 Anti-Corruption Laws (Amendment) Act, 1964 \u2013 Stay.

[Per A.K. Goel, J. (for himself and Navin Sinha, J.)] Stay: Duration of, in civil and criminal cases \u2013 Held: Where stay against proceedings of a civil or criminal trial is operating, the same will come to an end on expiry of six months \u2013 Administration of justice. [Per A.K. Goel, J. (for himself and Navin Sinha, J.)] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.19(3)(c) r/w ss.4(4) and 22 \u2013 Cases under the Act \u2013 Disposal of \u2013 Held: S.19(3)(c) read with ss.4(4) and 22, make it clear that cases under the Act have to be decided with utmost despatch and without any glitches on the way in the form of interlocutory stay orders. (Per R.F. Nariman, J.) Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s. 482 \u2013 Inherent Powers of Court \u2013 Nature of \u2013 Discussed. (Per R.F. Nariman, J.) Interpretation of Statutes: In case of ambiguity \u2013 Held: If there is an ambiguity, and two views are possible, the view which most accords with the object of the Act, and which makes the Act workable, must necessarily be the controlling view.
