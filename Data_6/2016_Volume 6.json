Agreement-I and Agreement-II become an \"'international commercial arbitration\" within the meaning of s. 2(j) - Execution of Agreement-II did not result in substituting or rescinding or extinguishing Agreement-I - It recognized the existence of Agreement-I and resulted in its amendment by adding some nel;I' clauses and one party - It cannot be said that as a result of execution of Agreement-JI, novation of contract has come in to be inter se parties - Further. s. 45 shows that once it is found that the agreement is a legal and valid agreement, which is capable of being performed by the parties to the suit, the court has to pass an order by referring the parties to t!J.e arbitration in terms of the agreement - Trial court though allowed the application holding that the agreement was legal and proper and capable of being performed but did not pass any consequential order as required u/s. 45 by referring the parties to the arbitration and instead simply dismissed the suit - Thus, the order is modified to this extent."
