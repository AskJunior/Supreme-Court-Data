The ruleof purposive construction can be applied in such a situation- A purposive construction of an enactment is one whichgives effect to the legislative purpose by following the literalmeaning of the enactment where that meaning is inaccordance with the legislative purpose or by applying astrained meaning where the literal meaning is not inaccordance with legislative purpose - If in a case literalinterpretation appears to be in any way in conflict with thelegislative intent or is leading to absurdity, purposiveinterpretation will ..have to be adopted - Code of CriminalProcedure, 1973 - Chapter XXXVI.Doctrine of reasonable construction - Court wouldinterpret a provision which would help sustaining the validity of Jaw by applying the doctrine of reasonable constructionrather than applying a doctrine which would make theprovision unsustainable and ultra vires the Constitution.Heading of Chapter - Held: 'Heading' or 'title' prefixed tosections or group of sections have a limited role to play inconstruction of statutes - They may be taken as very broadand general indicators or the nature of the subject matter dealtwith thereunder but they do not control the meaning ofsections if the meaning is otherwise ascertainable by readingthe section in proper perspective along with other provisions.Maxims: Relevance of legal maxims in interpreting a provision -Held: Though legal maxims are not mandatory rules, but theyseNe as guiding principles - Maxims - (i) 'nu/furn tempus autlocus occurrit regi', (ii) 'vigilantibus et non dormientibus, jurasubveniunt', (iii) 'actus curiae neminem gravabit' -Applicability of."
