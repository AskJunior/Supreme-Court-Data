eviction tonon-resident Indian \u2013 Constitutional validity of s. 13-B \u2013 Held:Section 13-B is constitutional valid as also its extension andapplicability to the Union Territory of Chandigarh \u2013 East PunjabUrban Rent Restriction (Amendment) Act , 2001 \u2013 PunjabRe-organisation Act, 1966 \u2013 s. 87.s. 13-B \u2013 Issuance of Notification dated 09.10.2009, u/s. 87of the Re-organisation Act, extending Section 13-B in theAmendment Act to the Union Territory of Chandigarh by executiveaction \u2013 Validity of \u2013 Held: Extension of the Amendment Act to theUnion Territory of Chandigarh falls within the ambit of conditionaldelegat ion and is valid and permissible \u2013 Once a policy ofextension of laws has been laid down by the Parliament and isclear and permissible, it would only seem as an inevitable falloutthat the executive should be permitted to extend future amendmentsto the existing laws \u2013 Thus, the challenge predicated on thedoctrine of excessive delegation, separation of powers, doctrineof the law of agency, cannot be accepted \u2013 Administrative law \u2013Conditional delegation \u2013 East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 \u2013 Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 \u2013s. 87 s. 13-B \u2013 Amendments made vide the Amendment Act withregard to the rights of Non-Resident Indians by the State Legislatureof Punjab \u2013 Legislative competence of the State \u2013 Held:Amendment Act enacted by the State legislature was well within itscompetence \u2013 Amendment Act on its true construction and byreference to the doctrine of \u201cpith and substance\u201d is relatable tothe relat ionship of landlord and tenant for housing andaccommodation and falls under the Concurrent List \u2013 Dominantintention or \u201cpith and substance\u201d of the legislation is to regulatethe relationship between Non-Resident Indian landlords and tenantsfor housing and accommodation \u2013 Merely because the AmendmentAct to achieve its object touches upon the subject matter in respectof Non-Resident Indian landlords in the Rent Act, does not makethe Amendment or the Rent Act ultra vires the Constitution \u2013 In thecontext of the Union Territory of Chandigarh and as the subjectmatter falls within the Concurrent List, it would be immaterial todecide on the competence of the legislating body \u2013 Power to makelaws in respect of a Union Territory vests with the Parliament underArt.246(4) \u2013 In terms of s. 87 of the Re-organisation Act, the powerto extend laws to the Union Territory of Chandigarh vests with theCentral Government, that is the Parliament or the CentralExecutive, as the case may be, and is permissible \u2013 Constitutionof India \u2013 Art. 246(4) \u2013 East Punjab Urban Rent Restriction(Amendment) Act, 2001 \u2013 Punjab Re-organisation Act, 1966 \u2013s. 87. s. 13-B \u2013 Plea that s. 13-B creates a special class of NRIlandlords, however, does not afford any legal remedy to the tenants\u2013 Reasonability of \u2013 Held: By providing for a simplified procedureof eviction by the Non-Resident Indians, s. 13-B does not dilutethe rights of tenants \u2013 It gives a chance to the tenants on merits toestablish their case and when justified and necessary to take thematter to trial \u2013 Thus, s. 13-B cannot be held to be arbitrary andunreasonable.s. 13-B \u2013 s. 13-B classifying non-Resident Indian landlordsas a separate category \u2013 Validity of Section 13-B \u2013 Held: Section13-B cannot be treated as an arbitrary classification that infringesand violates Article 14 \u2013 It cannot be held to be unconstitutionalbecause it grants a right to claim eviction for bona fide need bysummary procedure to a certain group of landlords-Non-Resident Indians subject to and on the satisfaction of statutory conditionswhich incorporate a check on frivolous evictions \u2013 It rests withthe legislature to make laws and extend it to other similarly situatedpersons \u2013 Rent Act(s) invariably give similar rights by a controlledmechanism and alluded riders to various other classes/groups oflandlords, namely, government servants, members of armed forces,the retired or soon to retire employees of the Central and the StateGovernments, widows, etc \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14.s. 13-B \u2013 Restrictions and conditions imposed on landlordseeking eviction under \u2013 Purpose of \u2013 Held: In terms of Section13-B, the condition imposed upon the landlord is that he shouldhave been the owner of the premises for five years before theeviction petition is filed \u2013 Such landlord/owner is permitted to filean eviction petition only once during the lifetime and in respect ofone building \u2013 Landlord cannot sell or give the premises on leasefor a period of five years from the date of taking possession fromthe tenant \u2013 On breach of the same, the tenant has a right to seekrestoration of possession \u2013 In case the landlord does not occupythe premises for a continuous period of three months after gettingan eviction order or lets out the whole or any part of the premisesto a third person other than the tenant in contravention of theprovisions of s. 13 B(3), punishment is imposed-\u2013 Thus, theserestrictions and conditions are strong in-built checks to ensure thatthe need of the landlord should be genuine and bona fide and thetenant should not be subjected to frivolous and dubious evictionorder by relying on false assertions.s.18-A and s.13-B \u2013 Right of Non-Resident Indians to initiateeviction under the summary procedure \u2013 Nature of \u2013 Held: Is notan unfettered and absolute right \u2013 It is subject to satisfaction ofvarious pre-requisites and imperatives that ensure and checkpotential abuse by resorting to a short-circui t procedure \u2013Requirement should arise from a genuine need of the Non-ResidentIndian landlord or his dependent \u2013 Furthermore, thesepre-conditions and post possession restrictions stated thereinsuggest that s. 13-B serves a specific policy objective to ensurethe right of Non-Resident Indians to occupy their property in theUnion Territory of Chandigarh and the State of Punjab as the casemay be, after \u201creturning\u201d to their country \u2013 This right has to bebalanced with the right of the tenants to establish their case on merits by disproving the genuine requirement of the Non-ResidentIndians \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of Pith and substance \u2013Meaning of \u2013 Held: Pith and substance doctrine states that if thelegislation is covered by an entry, that is, it is within the permittedjurisdiction of the legislature, any incidental encroachment in therival field has to be disregarded \u2013 Only when wide constructionof an entry leads to heads-on-clash with another entry in the sameor different List, the principle of harmonious construction isapplied to reconcile the conflict and to give effect to each of them.Constitution of India: Art. 254 \u2013 Repugnancy \u2013 Whenattracted \u2013 Held: Repugnancy arises between a Central and a StateAct when there is a direct and irreconcilable conflict between thetwo enactments and in that case, the Central Legislation prevailsby virtue of Art. 254 \u2013 Such repugnancy or inconsistency is not tobe readily inferred as the entries in the three Lists permit incidentalencroachment \u2013 Thus, every attempt must be made to placate theconflict and only when and in case of oppugnant clash, the courtshould proceed to strike down the legislation as trespassing beyondits legitimate and legal confines.Legislature: Function of \u2013 Held: Primary function of thelegislature is to make laws for all or different groups or classes ofpersons \u2013 Lawmakers as elected representatives are in a betterposition to know the needs, requirements and expectations ofcitizens \u2013 Thus, the legislature possesses the power to distinguishand classify persons or things subjected to such laws \u2013 Such aclassification, however, must pass the muster of Art. 14 whichproscribe hostile and invidious discrimination \u2013 Art. 14 does notentirely prohibit classification by grouping certain persons withspecial peculiarities in a special category to meet certain specificends.Legislation: Rent control legislation \u2013 Object of \u2013 Stated"

cognizancecan be taken under s.49 \u2013 However, offences by a body corporateare to be covered by s.47, since in event offences by bodycorporates are not covered by s.47, the benefit of s.47(1)

CPC, and inthe same manner as if it were a decree of the Court \u2013 The raisond\u2019etre for s.36 is only to make it clear that when an arbitral awardis not susceptible to challenge, either because the time for makingan application to set it aside has expired, or such applicationhaving been made is refused, the award, being final and binding,shall be enforced under the CPC, as if it were a decree of the court\u2013 To read s.36 as inferring something negative, namely, that wherethe time for making an application under s.34 has not expired and,therefore, on such application being made within time, anautomatic-stay ensues, is to read something into s.36 which is notthere at all \u2013 Automatic stay of award is, therefore, not a rule \u2013Also, this construction omits to consider the rest of s.36, whichdeals with applications under s.34 that have been dismissed, whichleads to an award being final and binding when read with s.35which then becomes enforceable under the CPC, the award beingtreated as a decree for this purpose \u2013 This is also supported bythe language of s.9 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, which specificallyenables a party to apply to a Court for reliefs \u201c\u2026after the makingof the arbitration award but before it is enforced in accordancewith s.36.\u201d \u2013 These words in s.9 have not undergone any changeby reason of the 2015 or 2019 Amendment Acts \u2013 Further, s.36,even as originally enacted, was not meant to do away withArt.36(2) of the UNCITRAL Model Law, but is really meant to doaway with the two bites at the cherry doctrine in the context ofawards made in India, and the fact that enforcement of a finalaward, when read with s.35, is to be under the CPC, treating theaward as if it were a decree of the court \u2013 The amended s.36, being clarificatory in nature, merely restates the position that theunamended s.36 does not stand in the way of the law as to grantof stay of a money decree under the provisions of the CPC.Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2019: s.13 \u2013Removal of basis of *BCCI judgment by Amendment Act, 2019 \u2013Whether 2019 Amendment Act removes the basis of *BCCIjudgment of Supreme Court \u2013 Held: Argument that the question ofremoving the basis of a judgment cannot arise unless and until thejudgment is present in the mind of the legislature and expresslyreferred to in the concerned Statement of Objects and Reasons isrejected \u2013 What is important is to see whether in substance, thebasis of a particular judgment is in fact removed, and not whetherthat judgment is referred to in the Statement of Objects and Reasonsof the amending act which seeks to remove its basis \u2013 Furtherargument that s.87 is nothing but a rehash of s.26 is also rejected\u2013 The scheme of s.87 is different from that of s.26, and is explicitin stating that court proceedings are merely parasitical on arbitralproceedings \u2013 It is, therefore, clear that only arbitral proceedingshave to be looked at to see whether the 2015 Amendment Act kicksin \u2013 Argument that in the instant case there was a direct assaulton a judgment of this Court without first removing its basis is,therefore, rejected \u2013 Legislative competence \u2013 Arbitration andConciliation Act, 1996.Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.87 \u2013 Constitutionalvalidity of introduction of s.87 into the Arbitration Act, 1996, anddeletion of s.26 of the 2015 Amendment Act by the 2019 AmendmentAct \u2013 Held: The law on s.26 of the 2015 Amendment Act was laiddown in *BCCI with great clarity \u2013 After construing s.26, the Courtcautioned the Government that the immediate effect of enacting theproposed s.87 would be directly contrary to the Statement andObjects and Reasons of the 2015 Amendment Act, which made itclear that the law prior to the 2015 Amendment Act resulted indelay of disposal of arbitral proceedings and an increase ininterference by courts in arbitration matters which tends to defeata primary object of the Arbitration Act, 1996 \u2013 To thereafter deletethis salutary provision and introduce s.87 in its place would bewholly without justification and contrary to the object sought tobe achieved by the 2015 Amendment Act, which was enactedpursuant to a detailed Law Commission Report which found various infirmities in the working of the original 1996 statute \u2013 Theintroduction of s.87 and deletion of s.26 of the 2015 AmendmentAct was thus manifestly arbitrary having been enactedunreasonably, without adequate determining principle and contraryto the public interest sought to be subserved by the Arbitration Act,1996 and the 2015 Amendment Act \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation(Amendment) Act, 2015 \u2013 s.26.Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.34 \u2013 It is wellsettled law that an application under s.34 of the Act, 1996 is asummary proceeding not in the nature of a regular suit \u2013 As aresult, a court reviewing an arbitral award under s.34 does not sitin appeal over the award, and if the view taken by the arbitratoris possible, no interference is called for.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.3(7) \u2013Interpretation of term \u2018Corporate person\u2019 \u2013 Plea that for recoveryof money from Government Companies, the definition of \u2018corporateperson\u2019 contained in s.3(7) of the Insolvency Code should eitherbe read without the words \u201cwith limited liability\u201d contained in thethird part of the definition or have s.3(23)(g) of the InsolvencyCode, which is the definition of \u2018person\u2019 read into the said provision\u2013 Held: A statutory body which functions as an extended limb ofthe Central Government, and performs governmental functionscannot be taken over by a resolution professional under theInsolvency Code, or by any other corporate body \u2013 Nor can suchAuthority ultimately be wound-up under the Insolvency Code \u2013 Forsuch reasons, it is not possible to either read in, or read down,the definition of \u2018corporate person\u2019 in s.3(7) of the InsolvencyCode.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object of \u2013 Held:The Insolvency Code is not meant to be a recovery mechanism, theidea of the Code being a mechanism which is triggered in orderthat resolution of stressed assets then takes place.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.5(6) \u2013 Definitionof \u2018dispute\u2019 \u2013 Held: The definition of \u2018dispute\u2019 in s.5(6) of theInsolvency Code deals with a suit or arbitration proceedingsrelating to one of three things - (a) the existence of the amount ofdebt; (b) the quality of goods or service; or (c) the breach of arepresentation or warranty \u2013 Insofar as (a) is concerned, the definition of the word \u2018debt\u2019 contained in s.3(11) of the InsolvencyCode, refers to a liability or obligation in respect of a claim whichis due from any person \u2013 This necessarily postulates the existenceof a contractual or other relationship, which gives rise to a liabilityor obligation between parties in law \u2013 The same goes for (c), as abreach of a representation or warranty can only be by onecontracting party to another \u2013 Also, when the quality of goods orservice is referred to in (b), this again postulates some contractualor other relationship in law by which one party may sue the other\u2013 Therefore, a dispute must be between the parties as understoodunder the Insolvency Code, which does not contain an Or.VIII-ACPC type mechanism \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.VIIIA.Constitution of India: Art.32 \u2013 Writ jurisdiction, invocationof \u2013 Factual disputes between parties relating to exact quantumof arbitral awards in favour of petitioner company \u2013 Held: It issettled law that when exercising its jurisdiction under Art.32 of theConstitut ion, Supreme Court cannot embark on a detailedinvestigation of disputed facts \u2013 In the instant case, there wasfactual dispute between the parties relating to: (i) the exactquantum of the arbitral awards in favour of the Petitioner companydue from the Respondent PSUs; (ii) the amounts which may havealready been paid and/or deposited by the Respondent PSUs infavour of the Petitioner company under the said arbitral awards;and (iii) whether stay orders of competent Courts were passed inrespect of these arbitral awards, and if so, whether they were underthe automatic-stay mode or not \u2013 This Court cannot, therefore, inexercise of its jurisdiction under Art.32 undertake a detailedinvestigation to determine the status of monies paid/depositedpursuant to arbitral-awards in favour of the Petitioner company\u2013 Consequently, no directions in respect thereof can be made inthese proceedings."

One crore with the CPCB \u2013 Further, noting that theconstruction at the project site had been completed, the NGTappointed a five-member expert committee to study the impact ofthe appellant\u2019s expanded project and to suggest remedial measures\u2013 In the instant appeal challenge was made to this order of theNGT \u2013 Held: The entire scheme of the EIA Notification is to ensure that any new or additional environmental impact is assessed andcertified by the relevant regulatory authorities \u2013 The lower limitof Entry 8(a) of the Schedule is a built up area of 20,000 sq. mtrsand the upper limit is 1,50,000 sq. mtrs \u2013 No doubt, theenvironmental impact of a construction of 1,50,000 sq. mtrs wouldbe drastically more than construction of 20,000 sq. mtrs \u2013 It cannotbe disputed that as the size of the project increases, so does themagnitude of the project\u2019s environmental impact \u2013 There may existcertain situations where the expansion sought by a projectproponent is truly marginal or the environmental impact of suchexpansion is non-existent \u2013 However, it is not for this Court to laydown a bright-line test as to what constitutes a \u2018marginal\u2019 increaseand what constitutes a material increase warranting a fresh Form1 and scrutiny by the Expert Appraisal Committee \u2013 Thus, anexpansion within the limits prescribed by the Schedules would besubject to the procedure set out in paragraph 7(ii) \u2013 At the time ofthe second increase, the total construction area of the appellant\u2019sproject was enlarged to 40,480.88 sq.mtrs \u2013 As a result ofexpansion, appellant constructed sixteen addi tional flats \u2013Appellant did not comply with the procedure set out underparagraph 7(ii) of the EIA Notification but rather sought an\u2018amendment\u2019 to the EC \u2013 SEIAA did not require the appellant tosubmit an updated Form 1 nor was the proposal processed andevaluated by SEAC \u2013 The \u2018amendment\u2019 to EC dated 13.03.2014did not discuss the potential environmental impact of the increasein construction area \u2013 The procedure set out under paragraph 7(ii)of the EIA Notification exists to ensure that where a project isexpanded in size, the environmental impact on the surrounding areais evaluated holistically considering all the relevant factorsincluding air and water availability and pollution, management ofsolid and wet waste and the urban carrying capacity of the area\u2013 This was not done in the case of the appellant\u2019s project \u2013 It wasnot open to SEIAA to grant an \u2018amendment\u2019 to the EC withoutfollowing the procedure set out in paragraph 7(ii) of the EIANotification \u2013 Further, as on the date of the impugned orderconstruction at the project site had already been completed \u2013 Bycompleting the construction of the project, the appellant deniedSEIAA and SEAC, the ability to evaluate the environmental impact and suggest methods to mitigate any environmental damage \u2013 Atthis stage, only remedial measures may be taken \u2013 The NGT alreadydirected the appellant to deposit one crore and has set up an expertcommittee to evaluate the impact of the appellant\u2019s project andsuggest remedial measures \u2013 In view of these circumstances, thedirections of the NGT are upheld and the Committee is directed tocontinue its evaluation of the appellant\u2019s project so as to bring itsenvironmental impact as close as possible to that contemplated inEC dated 02.05.2013 and also suggest the compensatory exactionto be imposed on the appellant.Interpretation of Statutes: Interpretation of Notification \u2013 Ina case where the text of the provisions requires interpretation,Courts must adopt an interpretation which is in consonance withthe object and purpose of the legislation or delegated legislationas a whole \u2013 EIA Notification was adopted with the intention ofrestricting new projects and the expansion of new projects untiltheir environmental impact could be evaluated and understood \u2013Environmental law"

mining lease grantedby Government of Karnataka which was to expire \u2013 ResolutionProfessional sought benefit of deemed extension of lease \u2013 StateGovernment rejected the proposal for deemed extension of mininglease \u2013 The said order challenged by Resolution Professional \u2013NCLT set aside the order of State Government on the ground thatthe same was in violation of moratorium declared in terms of s.14(1)of IBC, 2016 and directed the State Government to execute LeaseDeeds in favour of Corporate Debtor \u2013 By impugned order, HighCourt granted stay of operation of directions contained in the orderof NCLT \u2013 Whether High Court ought to have interfered underArt.226/227 of the Constitution, with an order passed by NCLT inproceeding under the IBC, 2016, despite the availability of astatutory alternative remedy of appeal to NCLAT \u2013 Held: Thedecision of the State Government to refuse the benefit of deemedextension of lease, is in the public law domain and, therefore, thecorrectness of the said decision can be called into question onlyin a superior court which is vested with the power of judicial reviewover administrative action \u2013 The NCLT, being a creature of a specialstatute to discharge certain specific functions, cannot be elevatedto the status of a superior court having such powers \u2013 The NCLTis not even a Civil Court, which has jurisdiction to try all suits ofa civil nature excepting suits, of which their cognizance is eitherexpressly or impliedly barred \u2013 Therefore NCLT can exercise onlysuch powers within the contours of jurisdiction as prescribed bythe statute, the law in respect of which, it is called upon toadminister \u2013 Though NCLT and NCLAT have jurisdiction to enquireinto questions of fraud, they would not have jurisdiction to adjudicate upon disputes such as those arising under MMDR Act,1957 and the rules issued thereunder, especially when the disputesrevolve around decisions of statutory or quasi-judicial authorities,which can be corrected only by way of judicial review ofadministrative action \u2013 The moratorium provided for in s.14 couldnot have any impact upon the right of the Government to refusethe extension of lease \u2013 The purpose of moratorium is only topreserve the status quo and not to create a new right \u2013 Therefore,NCLT did not have jurisdiction to entertain an application againstthe State Government for a direction to execute Supplemental LeaseDeeds for the extension of the mining lease \u2013 Since NCLT choseto exercise a jurisdiction not vested in it in law, the High Courtwas justified in entertaining the writ petition, on the basis that NCLTwas coram non judice \u2013 Mines and Minerals (Development andRegulation) Act, 1957 \u2013 Insolvency and

\u2013 Discussed.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Whether thequestions of fraud can be inquired into by the NCLT/NCLAT in theproceedings initiated under the IBC Code \u2013 Held: NCLT hasjurisdiction to enquire into allegations of fraud \u2013 As a corollary,NCLAT will also have jurisdiction \u2013 Fraudulent initiation of CIRPcannot be a ground to bypass the alternative remedy of appealprovided in s.61.Constitut ion of India: Arts.226/227 \u2013 Exercise ofjurisdiction, exception \u2013 In cases where a statutory alternativeremedy of appeal is available, one of the exceptions to the selfimposed restraint of the High Court is the lack of jurisdiction onthe part of the statutory/quasi-judicial authority, against whoseorder a judicial review is sought \u2013 Traditionally, English courtsmaintained a distinction between cases where a statutory/quasijudicialauthority exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it in lawand cases where there was a wrongful exercise of the availablejurisdiction \u2013 The distinction between lack of jurisdiction andwrongful exercise of available jurisdiction, should certainly betaken into account by High Courts, when Art.226 is sought to be invoked bypassing a statutory alternative remedy provided by aspecial statute.Constitution of India: Arts.226/227 \u2013 Scope of jurisdictionand nature of the powers exercised by High Court under Art.226of the Constitution \u2013 Discussed.Constitution of India: Arts.226/227 \u2013 Scope of jurisdictionof High Court over private individuals \u2013 Held: In view of the useof the expression \u201cany person\u201d in Art.226 (1), the jurisdiction ofthe High Court extends even over private individuals, provided thenature of the duties performed by such private individuals, arepublic in nature \u2013 Therefore, the remedies provided under Art.226are public law remedies, which stand in contrast to the remediesavailable in private law.Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act,1957: Object of enactment \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013Seventh Schedule \u2013 Union List \u2013 Entry 54.Companies Act, 2013: ss.408, 410 \u2013 Jurisdiction and powersof NCLT \u2013 NCLT and NCLAT are constituted, not under the IBC,2016 but under ss.408 and 410 of the Companies Act, 2013 \u2013ss.420 and 424 of the Companies Act, 2013 indicate in broad terms,merely the procedure to be followed by the NCLT and NCLATbefore passing orders \u2013 However, there are no separate provisionsin the Companies Act, exclusively dealing with the jurisdiction andpowers of NCLT \u2013 In contrast, Sub-sections (4) and (5) of s.60 ofIBC, 2016 give an indication respectively about the powers andjurisdiction of the NCLT \u2013 Sub-section (4) of s.60 of IBC, 2016states that the NCLT will have all the powers of the DRT ascontemplated under Part III of the Code for the purposes of Subsection(2) \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.60.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: ss.60, 179 \u2013 Unders.179 (1), it is the DRT which is the Adjudicating Authority inrelation to insolvency matters of individuals and firms \u2013 This is incontrast to s.60(1) which names the NCLT as the AdjudicatingAuthority in relation to insolvency resolution and liquidation ofcorporate persons including corporate debtors and personalguarantors \u2013 The object of Sub-section (2) of s.60 is to avoid anyconfusion that may arise on account of s.179(1) and to ensure that whenever a CIRP is initiated against a corporate debtor, NCLT willbe the Adjudicating Authority not only in respect of such corporatedebtor but also in respect of the individual who stood as surety tosuch corporate debtor, notwithstanding the naming of the DRTunder s.179(1) as the Adjudicating Authority for the insolvencyresolution of individuals."

protection againsteviction under East Punjab Rent Act which cannot be taken awayunder the Religious Premises Act \u2013 Held: Vires of the ReligiousPremises Act, a special enactment concerning landlord and tenantrelationships, cannot be challenged on the ground that there arealready two other enactments governing general landlord andtenant relationships-Transfer of Property Act and East Punjab RentAct \u2013 Constitution confers the power and authority on the State toenact two separate enactments on a similar subject if they seek toachieve different objectives and protect and preserve different setsof rights and make necessary classification to serve such variedends \u2013 Religious Premises Act, unlike the East Punjab Rent Act andthe Public Premises Act, concerns itself with the administration ofpremises belonging to religious institutions and seeks to regulatetheir rights as landlords vis-a-vis the tenants in occupation \u2013Furthermore, the State legislature while enacting the ReligiousPremises Act was aware that it has enacted East Punjab Rent Act,an existing statute governing landlord and tenant relationship \u2013However, the State legislature in its wisdom deemed it appropriateto enact a law in respect of land and buildings belonging to\u201creligious institutions\u201d \u2013 East Punjab Urban Rent RestrictionsAct, 1949.Punjab Religious Premises and Land (Eviction and RentRecovery) Act, 1997 \u2013 Eviction proceedings against the tenants bythe Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee under the East Punjab RentAct \u2013 Subsequently, enactment of Religious Premises Act andejectment proceedings against the tenant under the Religious Premises Act \u2013 Plea of tenant that Religious Premises Act createsan artificial classification as tenants of land and buildingsbelonging to or owned by religious institutions are no longerentitled to protection under the East Punjab Rent Act though suchprotection continues to be available to other tenants \u2013 Held:Charitable or religious institutions or endownments fall into aseparate category and form a class by themselves \u2013 Tenantscoming under them also form a separate class and can be treateddifferently from others \u2013 Classification of properties of religiousinstitutions as a separate and distinctive class of properties wouldnot fall foul or be violative of Art. 14 \u2013 Granting exemption tobuildings belonging to charities, religious or secular institutions,from rent control legislation, would not offend the equal protectionclause of Art. 14 as it is a reasonable classification based onintelligible differentia and also satisfies the test of nexus as suchinstitutions not only serve public purpose but disbursement of theirincome is governed by the objects for which they are created \u2013Thus, the withdrawal of protection to the tenants of such buildingswas justified \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14 \u2013 East Punjab UrbanRent Restrictions Act,

deemed tobe in unauthorised occupation of any religious premises if he has,before or after commencement of the Religious Premises Act,entered into possession of a land or building belonging to areligious institution otherwise than under or pursuant to anyallotment, lease or grant \u2013 A person who enters into possessionof the land or building belonging to or owned by a religiousinstitution and has valid and subsisting allotment, lease or grantis clearly not an unauthorised occupant \u2013 Valid grants, leases andallotments are not construed and treated as unauthorisedoccupation \u2013 It is only when the terms of the grant, lease orallotment are not adhered to or have been determined or the periodof allotment, lease or grant as fixed has come to an end, that theperson in occupation is treated to be in unauthorised occupation\u2013 This is a pre-condition which confers the right on the religiousinstitution to seek eviction of a person in unauthorised occupationof the religious premises \u2013 Determinative factor in deciding the question of \u201cunauthorised occupation\u201d is the tenure of allotment,lease or the grant and terms and conditions as agreed or stated,and not payment of rent.Punjab Religious Premises and Land (Eviction and RentRecovery) Act, 1997 \u2013 ss. 4, 5 \u2013 Eviction under \u2013 Held: UnderSection 4, a

Onlya redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliamentand in public domain\u201d should be replaced by: \u201c The Governmenthas already shared the pricing details with the CAG. The report ofthe CAG is examined by the PAC in the usual course of business.Only a redacted version of the report is placed before theParliament and in Public domain\u201d.Rafale Fighter Jets Case \u2013 Judgment \u2013 Review of \u2013 It wascontended by the petitioner that in writ petition a prayer was madefor registration of an FIR and investigation by the CBI, which wasnot dealt with and the contract was reviewed prematurely by theJudiciary without the benefit of investigation and inquiry into thedisputed questions of facts \u2013 Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J.for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.) : Not a fair submission forthe reason that all counsels, including counsel representing thepetitioners in this matter addressed elaborate submissions on all the aspects \u2013 There was a prayer for registration of F.I.R andfurther investigation but then once all the aspects were examinedon merits, the Supreme Court did not consider it appropriate to issueany directions.Rafale Fighter Jets Case \u2013 Judgment \u2013 Review of \u2013 Pricingof the Jets \u2013 Held (Per Sanjay Kishan Kaul, J. for himself andRanjan Gogoi, CJI.) : It is not the function of the Supreme Courtto determine the prices nor for that matter can such aspects bedealt with on mere suspicion of persons who decide to approachthe Court \u2013 The internal mechanism of such pricing would takecare of the situation \u2013 The pricing of the basic aircraft had to becompared which was competitively marginally lower \u2013 As to whatshould be loaded on the aircraft or not and what further pricingshould be added has to be left to the best judgment of thecompetent authorities.Rafale Fighter Jets Case \u2013 Judgment \u2013 Review of \u2013 ContemptPetition \u2013 The contempt petition emanates from an allegationagainst the then President of the Indian National Congress onaccount of utterances made in the presence of several mediapersons that the Supreme Court was in consonance with what hisdiscourse was, i.e. that the prime Minister of India stole money fromthe Air Force and give it to a particular business group and PrimeMinister had indulged in corruption \u2013 Held (Sanjay Kishan Kaul,J. for himself and Ranjan Gogoi, CJI.): The matter wascompounded by filing a 20 page affidavit with a large number ofdocuments annexed rather than simply accepting the mistake andgiving an unconditional apology \u2013 However, a subsequent affidavitwas filed on 08.05.2019 with better wisdom \u2013 In view of thesubsequent affidavit, better sense having prevailed \u2013 The ContemptProceedings are closed with a word of caution for the contemnorto be more careful in future.Rafale Fighter Jets Case \u2013 Judgment \u2013 Review of \u2013 Thecomplaint is that the Supreme Court totally overlooked the reliefsought in Writ Petition (Criminal) No. 298 of 2018 \u2013 In the saidwrit petition, the petitioner had sought registration of an F.I.R. andinvestigation of the offences disclosed \u2013 The petitioners in the saidcase, premise their case on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Lalita Kumari v. Government of Uttar Pradesh and others \u2013 It iscontended that error is apparent in not even considering the impactof the Constitution Bench and requires to be redressed through theReview Petition \u2013 Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)) : Thefour writ petitions were heard together, the Court had proceededto focus on the merits of the matter itself undoubtedly from the standpoint of the limited judicial review which it could undertake in amatter of the nature in question \u2013 On basis of the said exercise,the Court has concluded that there were no materials for the Courtto interfere \u2013 But this is a far cry from holding that it will not followthe mandate of the Constitution bench of the Supreme Court inregard to the steps to be undertaken by the officer on receipt of acomplaint purporting to make out the commission of a cognizableoffence \u2013 The Supreme Court may declare that it was non-suitingthe petitioners seeking judicial review, having regard to the absenceof materials which would have justified holding the award of thecontract in question vulnerable \u2013 It would not mean it is eitherprecluded or that it was not duty-bound to still direct that the lawlaid down by the Constitution bench in Lalita Kumari be conformedto \u2013 Also, the Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari had consideredthe necessity for preliminary inquiry in of fences relating tocorruption \u2013 Therefore, the petitioners may not be justified inapproaching the Supreme Court seeking the relief of registrationof an F.I.R. and investigation on the same as such \u2013 This for thereason as there were allegations of corruption and the petitionerhad not sought relief of a preliminary inquiry \u2013 Furthermore, thepetitioners had filed complaint fully knowing that s. 17A of thePrevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act, 2018 constituted a barto any inquiry or enquiry or investigation unless there was previousapproval \u2013 The petitioners had requested approval u/s. 17A in thecomplaint but the same relief was not sought in the writ petition \u2013Even proceeding on the basis that on petitioners\u2019 complaint, an FIRmust be registered as it purports to disclose cognizable offencesand the Court must so direct, it will be a futile exercise havingregard to s.17A \u2013 In the instant case, the petitioners cannot succeedin the Review petition \u2013 However, the judgment sought to bereviewed, would not stand in the way of the first respondent-CBIfrom taking action on the complaint in accordance with law andsubject to obtaining previous approval u/s. 17A of the Act, 2018 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.137 \u2013 Review \u2013 Jurisdiction in \u2013Held (Per K.M. Joseph, J. (concurring)): The principle well-settledin regard to jurisdiction in review, is that a review is not an appealin disguise \u2013 The applicant, in a review, is, on most occasions, toldoff the gates, by pointing out that his remedy lay in pursuing anappeal \u2013 In the case of a decision rendered by the Supreme Court,it is to be noticed that the underpinning based on availability ofan appeal, is not available as the Supreme Court is the final Courtand no appeal l ies \u2013 While a review petit ion has not beenunderstood as an appeal in disguise and a mere erroneous decisionmay not justify a review, a decision which betrays an error whichis apparent, does entitle the Court to exercise its jurisdiction u/Art.137 of the Constitution.Constitution of India \u2013 Art.137 \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure,1908 \u2013 Or. XLVII, r.1 \u2013 Review \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 Held (PerK.M. Joseph, J.(concurring)): A Review Petition is maintainableif the impugned judgment of the Supreme Court discloses an errorapparent on the face of the record \u2013 For granting review u/Art.137 of the Constitution r/w. Or. XLVII, r.1 of the C.P.C., the errorcan be an error of fact or of law \u2013 Error has been described as apalpable error or glaring omission \u2013 As to what constitutes anerror apparent on the face of record, is a matter to be found incontext of the facts of each case.Police \u2013 Police officer \u2013 Power of \u2013 Power of police officerwider and different from that of writ Court \u2013 Held (Per K.M.Joseph, J.(concurring)): In the instant case, the CBI is the premierinvestigation agency of the country \u2013 It is equipped to undertakeall forms of investigations, be it technical or otherwise \u2013 TheSupreme Court held in the writ petitions filed before this ReviewPetitions, that it is neither appropriate nor with the Court\u2019sexperience to step into what is technically feasible or not \u2013 No suchlimitation applies to an investigator of a cognizable offence \u2013 Whatis important is that it is the duty of the investigating officer to collectall material, be it technical or otherwise and thereafter, submit anappropriate report to the Court concerned, be it a final report orchallan depending upon the materials unearthed \u2013 The Court hadrelied on absence of the substantial materials \u2013 However, this isnot the restriction on the Investigating Officer"

money from PW-2for providing electricity connection to his shed \u2013 On PW-2\u2019scomplaint, trap was laid on the fateful day \u2013 Currency notes weresubjected to chemical treatement \u2013 Raiding party along with PW-2, PW-3 and PW-5 proceeded to the DESU office \u2013 When PW-2approached appellant, he took him to a garment shop on hisscooter and went inside the shop where he asked PW-2 to give themoney \u2013 PW-2 gave currency notes to appellant in a polythene bagwhich was put in appellant\u2019s pant pocket as directed by theappellant \u2013 PW-3 (panch witness) present in the immediate vicinitygave signal to the raiding party \u2013 Inspector (PW-5) in the presenceof PW-2 and PW-3 recovered tainted money from the pant pocketof the appellant \u2013 Conviction of appellant by courts below \u2013Challenged on the ground that there were major contradictions onmaterial aspect in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses \u2013 Held:Minor discrepancy and inability of prosecution witnesses toremember the exact details of whether or not the handwash or pantwash was done would not justify acquittal of the appellant \u2013Deviations between the testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 would notmean that the demand and payment of bribe, the trap and seizureof the bribe money was not proved \u2013 The contradictions that creptin the testimonies of PW-2 and PW-3 on the question of the totalamount demanded were immaterial and inconsequential as it wasproved that the bribe was demanded and taken by the appellanton fateful day \u2013 The variations as highlighted would losesignificance in view of the proven facts on the recovery of bribemoney from the pant pocket of the appellant, on which depositionsof PW-2, PW-3 and PW-5 were identical and not at variance \u2013 The money recovered was the currency notes that were treated and notedin the pre- raid proceedings \u2013 The contradictions as pointed outwere insignificant when juxtaposed with the vivid and eloquentnarration of incriminating facts proved and established beyonddoubt \u2013 Given the time gap of five to six years, minor contradictionson some details were bound to occur and are natural \u2013 Thewitnesses are not required to recollect and narrate the entire versionwith photographic memory notwithstanding the hiatus and passageof time \u2013 Picayune variations do not in any way negate andcontradict the main and core incriminatory evidence of the demandof bribe, reason why the bribe was demanded and the actual takingof the bribe that was paid, which are the ingredients of the offenceunder ss. 7 and 13 of the Act, that have been proved andestablished beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 Documents preparedcontemporaneously affirmed the primary and ocular evidence \u2013Therefore, there was no good ground and reason to upset and setaside the findings recorded by the trial court that were upheld bythe High Court.Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.20 \u2013 Presumption asto acceptance of illegal gratification \u2013 In the case at hand, thecondition precedent to drawing a legal presumption that theaccused demanded and was paid the bribe money was proved andestablished by the incriminating material on record \u2013 Thus, thepresumption under s.20 of the Act was applicable for the offencecommitted by the appellant under s.7 of the Act \u2013 Appellant wasfound in possession of the bribe money and no reasonableexplanation was furnished that may rebut the presumption.Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.17 \u2013 Procedural lapse\u2013 Effect on prosecution case \u2013 Contention of appellant thatinvestigation was not conducted by the police officer by the rankand status of the Deputy Superintendent of Police or equal, butby Inspector (PW-5) and Inspector (PW-7) \u2013 Held: The contentionis rejected for the reason that while this lapse would be anirregularity and unless the irregularity has resulted in causingprejudice, the conviction will not be vitiated and bad in law \u2013Appellant did not allege or even argue that any prejudice wascaused and suffered because the investigation was conducted bythe police officer of the rank of Inspector Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.19 \u2013 Sanction forprosecution \u2013 Appellant challenged the validity of sanction order\u2013 Held: There was no error in the sanction order \u2013 What the lawrequires is the application of mind by the Sanctioning authority onthe material placed before it to satisfy itself of prima facie casethat would constitute the offence \u2013 Sanctioning authority in hiscross- examination was clear and categoric that he had receivedthe report of the Investigating Officer along with the kalandra oforal and documentary evidence \u2013 Sanctioning authority examinedand considered the relevant material in the form of oral anddocumentary evidence that were a part and parcel of the kalandra.Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988: s.19(1) \u2013 A mere error,omission or irregularity in sanction is not considered to be fatalunless it has resulted in a failure of justice or has been occasionedthereby \u2013 s.19(1) of the Act is matter of procedure and does notgo to the root of the jurisdiction and once the cognizance has beentaken by the court under the Code, it cannot be said that an invalidpolice report is the foundation of jurisdiction of the court to takecognizance and for that matter the trial"

murdered in hishouse \u2013 The alleged contract killer came as a courier boy wearingblack cap and goggles \u2013 The wife of the complainant identifiedhim in investigation \u2013 As per the version of son/nephew andbrothers of the deceased, the deceased had invested a substantialamount of money in committees run by accused-SCB and his sonaccused-SB which they were reluctant to return and were alsotrying to usurp share of the deceased in a factory \u2013 Statement ofanother brother of the deceased was that he and his son werereceiving threatening calls from accused-NM, accused-LM andtheir associates and that these accused were responsible for murderof deceased \u2013 NM, LM and accused-Advocate-RS were arrestedwhen they were travelling in a car and black photo frame, blackcap, black goggles and a photo of the deceased were recoveredfrom the car \u2013 NM got the Getz car recovered from the house inhis village, in which the contract killer \u2013 JSS allegedly travelledto the site of occurrence to murder the deceased \u2013 The unlicensedpistol along with two live cartridges were recovered from the officeof accused-SS \u2013 During investigation, the Call Detail Records ofthe accused were collected by the Investigating Officer \u2013 As perthe version of the prosecution, NM had asked his cousin brotherLM to carry out the murder \u2013 Af ter initial ly agreeing, LMsubsequently backed out \u2013 Thereafter, JSS was asked to executethe murder \u2013 F.S.L Report recorded that the lead recovered fromthe body of the deceased was fired from the pistol recovered fromthe office of SS \u2013 As per the report of the handwriting expert, thespecimen handwriting of JSS matched the writing on the envelopewhich allegedly was carried by JSS to the house of the deceased\u2013 NM borrowed a car, unlicenced pistol with five cartridges and took JSS to the place of occurrence and waited in the car for JSSwhile he went to murder the deceased and then helped JSS to getaway \u2013 NM was in continuous contact with accused-SB before andafter the incident \u2013 The records of the committees run by SCB wereallegedly destroyed by him \u2013 This would a strong suspicion aboutthe conduct of SCB \u2013 The destruction of the records of thecommittees, which would have revealed the substantial investmentsmade by the deceased was an incriminating factor \u2013 Thecircumstance of absconding of accused immediately after themurder would be also admissible as relevant \u2018conduct\u2019 under s.8of the Evidence Act \u2013 The contemporaneous Call Detail Records(CDRs) between SB and NM, who accompanied JSS would alsoconstitute strong material for framing the charge against all theaccused \u2013 Charge Sheet was filed against all the accused \u2013Sessions Court held that there was common intention between NMand JSS in the act of killing the deceased \u2013 However LM wasdischarged as there was not sufficient evidence to connect him withthe crime \u2013 With respect to RS, it was held that evidence was notsufficient to frame charges against him as he had only tenderedadvice to NM to the effect that he should not use his licensed pistolfor carrying out the murder \u2013 With respect to SS, the Sessions Courtheld that the unlicensed pistol along with two live cartridges wererecovered from his office and charged him only for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act for keeping an unlicensed firearm in hispossession \u2013 Sessions Court discharged SCB since the prosecutionhad collected evidence against him only in the form of disclosurestatements from the accused persons after arrest \u2013 Sessions Courtcharged SB for the offence u/S. 25 of the Arms Act, since he gotthe licensed pistol belonging to NM recovered from his factorypremises \u2013 Sessions Court held that the prosecution failed to makeout a prima facie case against RS, LM, SCB who were discharged\u2013 The State and the complainant filed Revision before the HighCourt \u2013 High Court held that NM, SB, JSS were to be charged u/s.302 read with s.34 IPC read with 120B IPC \u2013 The Judgment ofthe Sessions Court ordering discharge of SCB, SS, LM, RS wasaffirmed by the High Court \u2013 Hence the instant appeal by the Stateand the complainant \u2013 Held: The present case is one where theprosecution has alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy tomurder the deceased by all the accused \u2013 The crime was not committed at the spur of the moment, but was preceded bymeticulous planning where each of the accused played a separaterole to achieve the common illegal object of carrying out themurder of the deceased \u2013 The manner and circumstances in whichthe offence was committed, and the level of involvement of theaccused persons were relevant factors \u2013 Each conspirator playedhis separate part in one integrated and united effort to achievethe common purpose \u2013 Each one was aware that he has a part toplay in the general conspiracy, to accomplish the common object\u2013 Conspiracy is mostly proved by circumstantial evidence by takinginto account the cumulative effect of the circumstances indicatingthe guilt of the accused, rather than adopting an approach byisolating the role played by each of the accused \u2013 The acts orconduct of the parties must be conscious and clear enough to infertheir concurrence as to the common design and its execution \u2013 Incases of criminal conspiracy, better evidence than acts andstatements of co-conspirators is hardly ever available \u2013 There wasample material brought on record which created a grave suspicionabout the involvement of SCB, LM, SS in the murder of the deceased\u2013 Accordingly, Sessions Court is directed to frame charges againstSCB under s.302 r/w s.34 IPC and s.120B and s.201; LM unders.302 r/w s.34 and s.120B; and against SS under s.302 r/w s.34and s.120B and ss.25, 27, 54 and 59 of Arms Act \u2013 Penal Code,1860 \u2013 s.302 r/w s.34.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.227, 228 \u2013 Scope of\u2013 Held: The Court while considering the question of framingcharges under s.227 has the power to sift and weigh the evidencefor the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima faciecase has been made out against the accused \u2013 If the materialplaced before the court discloses grave suspicion against theaccused, which has not been properly explained, the court will befully justified in framing charges and proceeding with the trial \u2013At this stage, there cannot be a roving enquiry into the pros andcons of the matter, the evidence is not to be weighed as if a trial isbeing conducted.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.223, 386, 391 \u2013 Held:s.223 provides that persons accused of the same offence, committedin the course of the same transaction, must be jointly charged andtried \u2013 In the instant case, on account of the inconsistency in framing charges by the Sessions Court against the six accused, thetrial got truncated \u2013 The trial with respect to three accused i.e. SB,NM and JSS proceeded in the absence of the other three accusedviz. SCB, LM and SS \u2013 This was a case of criminal conspiracybased on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Since the trial in the instantcase got truncated, it is necessary that the trial of the remainingthree accused proceeds forthwith in accordance with law \u2013 Withrespect to the other three accused i.e. SB, NM and JSS the trialwas conducted in the absence of the other three alleged co-conspirators\u2013 The order of acquittal with respect to SB and NMis pending before the High Court \u2013 s.386 defines the powers ofthe appellate court in dealing with appeals \u2013 Under clause (a) ofs.386, the High Court may reverse the order of acquittal and directthat further enquiry be made, or the accused may be re-tried, ormay find him guilty and pass sentence thereon \u2013 As an appellateCourt, the High Court may take further evidence while consideringthe appeals under s.391, if it is considered necessary, and takeadditional evidence on record. The High Court may also permitrecording of statements under s.313 if considered necessary \u2013 HighCourt may take up the pending appeals in the case of SB, NM andJSS, after the conclusion of the trial of SCB, LM and SS, theremaining accused by the Sessions Court in this case"
