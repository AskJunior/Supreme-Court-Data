Appeal: Criminal appeal by State for enhancement of sentence E - Held: In such an appeal, accused can plead for his acquittal on establishing that there is no material on record to sustain \u00b7his conviction. Criminal Law: F Right of private defence - Hand of victim chopped off over a land dispute - Held: Exercise of right of private defence even if not specifically taken in statement uls 313, CrPC, it can always be gathered from facts and circumstances - In the instant case on the basis of evidence of record, a finding G has been returned by trial court that on the day of occurrence, possession of land in dispute was with the victim and others, and accused had no right to forcibly evict them - Further, victims were not armed with weapons and were peacefully carrying on their agricultural activities when accused personscame armed with weapons and attacked the - Injuries on assailants were a/so absolutely simple in nature :- Therefore, it cannot be said that the defence has been able to establish the plea of right of private defense, nor does the question of exceeding the said right arise.
