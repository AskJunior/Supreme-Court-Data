Two circumstances which are principally reliedupon by the prosecution are the recovery of a mobile phone whichwas allegedly used for making demands of ransom; and Seizureof 9 mm pistol. The first circumstance regarding mobile phoneis not proved at all. The mobile number was not subscribed bydeceased \u2018B\u2019 but was subscribed by \u2018S\u2019. No link between thesetwo persons has been established nor any bill in the name of said\u2018B\u2019 was produced on record. Since the evidence that the mobilenumber was subscribed by said \u2018S\u2019 was led by the prosecutionitself, it cannot be assumed that said mobile number was, in fact,subscribed by \u2018B\u2019. The connection which would link the accusedwith the murder of \u2018B\u2019, on this front is completely missing. Asregards the second circumstance, it is true that the bulletrecovered from the body of the deceased matched with theservice weapon which was allocated to PW11-Police Naik but thetheory that the weapon was snatched by the accused is notsufficiently established. No Test Identification Parade was heldand if held, no material in that behalf has been produced on record.The second circumstance, therefore, is not sufficiently establishedas against the accused. [Paras 9 and 15] [16-G-H; 19-B-D]2. Applying the principles as culled out in the SharadBirdhichand Sarda decision, which have stood the test of time,the matter is not free from doubt. The circumstances relied uponmust rule out every single hypothesis except the guilt of theperson accused of an offence. There are too many missing linksin the present matter and the material on record does notexclude every single hypothesis except the guilt of the man.13. Therefore, the benefit of doubt given to the Appellant. TheAppellant is acquitted of the charges levelled against him.[Paras 17, 18] [20-E-G]"

In absence of any medical examinationdone, the prosecution did not examine any doctor in the trial insupport of their case. It was not disputed that similar type ofcomplaints were being made in past by the complainant againstother persons also and such complaints were later found false. Itwas also not disputed that there was enmity between the appellantand the husband of the prosecutrix, due to which their relationswere not cordial. It had also come in evidence that the prosecutrixwas in the habit of implicating all the persons by making wildallegations of such nature against those with whom she or/andher husband were having any kind of disputes. There was no eyewitness to the alleged incident and the one, who was cited aswitness, i.e., PW-2 was a chance witness on whose testimony, acharge of rape could not be established. So far as PW-1, husbandof the complainant, is concerned, he admitted that he was awayand returned to village the next day morning of the incident. Inthe light of the aforementioned reasons, the prosecution has failedto prove the case of rape alleged by the Complainant (PW-3)against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The appellant isacquitted from the charges leveled against him. [Paras 11, 12and 14] [23-C-G; 24-B]"

The power toorder an audit is vested with the assessing officer. As anecessary incident of this power, sub-section (2C) imposes anobligation on the assessee to furnish the report to the assessingofficer within the period which is specified by the assessingofficer. The substantive part of sub-section (2C) places anobligation on the assessee to comply with the time schedule which [2019] 5 S.C.R. 2526 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.is prescribed by the assessing officer. The overall ceiling of timeappears in the proviso to sub-section (2C), which mandates thatthe aggregate of the time fixed and the extended period cannotexceed 180 days, after which there can be no further extensionof time. [Para 15] [38-C-E]1.2 The proviso was intended to deal with a situation wherean assessee, for valid reasons, may not be able to furnish theaudit report within the period that was fixed by the assessingofficer. The enactment of the proviso was necessary to give aremedy to an assessee who, for genuine reasons, is unable tocomply with the direction issued in the first instance by theassessing officer. Hence, the proviso stipulates that for good andsufficient reason, the assessing officer may extend time on anapplication submitted by the assessee. The \u201cgood and sufficientreason\u201d requirement is intended to ensure that an extension oftime cannot be demanded by the assessee as a matter of right.Indeed, the use of the expression \u2018may\u2019 indicates that whetheror not time should be extended is discretionary. [Para 17][38-G-H; 39-A-B]1.3 In determining whether the power to extend time vestsin the assessing officer in a situation where the assessee has notmade an application for extension, it is well to remember thatunder the substantive part of sub-section (2C), the assessingofficer can fix time for the submission of the audit report. Subjectto an overall limit of 180 days, the assessing officer is fully clothedwith the authority to determine the time within which the auditreport should be submitted. For instance, the assessing officermay in a given case consider the grant of 90 days as adequate forthe completion of the exercise. Though the assessing officer hasthe power, in the first instance, to fix an even longer periodsubject to the overall ceiling of time, she may fix a particularperiod within the limit. To then postulate that while theassessing officer could in the first instance have fixed a longertime limit but, having fixed a limit of time, is precluded fromextending time thereafter would be an absurd course ofinterpretation. The assessing officer while fixing time in the firstinstance will do so on an estimate of the reasonable time which islikely to be taken in completing the exercise and submitting an27audit report. The exigencies of the situation may howeverrequire an extension of time for genuine reasons or, as thestatute calls it, \u201cfor any good and sufficient reason\u201d. [Para 18][39-B-E]1.4 The proviso to sub-section (2C) creates a remedy foran assessee to apply for extension where, for a good andsufficient reason, the audit report could not be submitted.Otherwise, the assessee may face a penalty under Section 271apart from being subjected to a best judgment assessment underSection 144. By extending time at the behest of the assessee,the assessing officer allows the original order calling for an auditreport to be duly implemented. The creation of a remedy underthe proviso in favour of the assessee cannot be construed todetract from the authority which vests in the assessing officer,who has specified the time limit for the submission of an auditreport in the first instance, to extend time without an applicationby the assessee. To hold otherwise, and to construe the provisoto sub-section (2C) as foreclosing the authority of the assessingofficer to extend time without a request by the assessee, wouldlead to an absurd consequence. The assessee would then be incontrol of whether or not to seek an extension of time, where theaudit report has not been finalized. Even if the auditor, forgenuine reasons (not bearing on the default of the assessee),was unable to comply with the time schedule, having regard tothe nature or complexity of the accounts, the assessee wouldthen have a sole and unrestricted power to determine whetheran extension should be sought. Not seeking an extension wouldin effect defeat the underlying purpose and object of directingthe assessee to obtain a report of an auditor under sub-section(2A). The legislature could not have intended this consequence.An interpretation which would defeat the purpose underlyingsub-section (2A) must be avoided. The assessing officer who hasfixed the time in the first instance must necessarily, as anincident of the authority to fix time, be entitled to extend timewithout an application by the assessee. While extending time,the assessing officer will be subject to the overall ceiling of timefixed under the proviso to sub section 2C. Secondly, thealternate construction of the proviso is that the expression \u201candCOMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, NEW DELHI v. RAMKISHAN DASS28 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.for any good and sufficient reason\u201d should be read to mean \u201corfor any good and sufficient reason\u201d, as a matter of statutoryinterpretation. [Para 19, 20] [39-F-H; 40-A-E]1.5 The Notes on Clauses as well as the Memorandum tothe Finance Act do not indicate a contrary hypothesis. Thereason for the introduction of the amendment arose because ofthe element of ambiguity inherent in the erstwhile position as itstood before 1 April 2008. The ambiguity was precisely on thequestion as to whether the assessing officer was precluded fromgranting an extension of time of his own accord merely becausethe assessee was permitted to apply for an extension. Since thepurpose of the amendment was to remove this ambiguity, by theFinance Act, Parliament essentially clarified the position as itexisted prior to the amendment. Moreover, there exists apresumption of retrospective application in regard to amendmentswhich are of a procedural nature. [Para 22, 23] [42-D-G]Interpretation of Statutes by Maxwell 11th Edn,Sweet and Maxwell (1962) p 217 - referred to.1.6 It cannot be said that to adopt an interpretation whichis placed on the provisions of Section 142(2C) would enable theassessing officer to extend the period of limitation for making anassessment under Section 153B. Explanation (iii) as it stood atthe material time, provided for the exclusion of the period com\u0002mencing from the date on which the assessing officer had directedthe assessee to get his accounts audited under sub-section (2A)and ending on the day on which the assesee is required to fur\u0002nish a report under that sub-section. The day on which theassessee is required to furnish a report of the audit undersub-section (2A) marks the culmination of the period of exclu\u0002sion for the purpose of limitation. Where the assessing officerhad extended the time, the period, commencing from the date onwhich the audit was ordered and ending with the date on whichthe assessee is required to furnish a report, would be excludedin computing the period of limitation for framing the assessmentu/s.153B. The principle governing the exclusion of time remainsthe same. The act on which the exclusion culminates is the datewhich the assessing officer fixes originally, or on extension forsubmission of the report. [Para 24] [43-F-H; 44-A-B]291.7 The issue as to whether the amendment which has beenbrought about by the legislature is intended to be clarificatory orto remove an ambiguity in the law must depend upon thecontext. The Court would have due regard to the general scopeand purview of the statute; the remedy sought to be applied; theformer state of the law; and what power that the legislaturecontemplated. Interpretation is a matter of determining the pathon the basis of statutory context and legislative history.[Para 25] [44-B-C, E]1.8 The provisions of Section 142(2C), as they stood priorto the amendment which was enacted with effect from 1.04.2008by the Finance Act, 2008 did not preclude the exercise ofjurisdiction and authority by the assessing officer to extend timefor the submission of the audit report directed under sub-section(2A), without an application by the assessee. The amendmentwas intended to remove an ambiguity and is clarificatory innature. [Para 26] [44-G; 45-A-B]"

The concept underlying the enactment ofEmployees\u2019 Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act,1952 had been of providing for compulsory contributory providentfunds for safeguarding the future of industrial workers. Elaborateprovisions have been made in the Act for creation of a Fund, tobe settled in accordance with a Scheme to be framed by the CentralGovernment. However, the Act also provides for continuation ofsuch of the other provident funds, which are offering equal or [2019] 5 S.C.R. 61 6162 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.more advantageous terms to the employees concerned and areoperating efficiently. [Para 9.1] [75-F-H]2. There is no definition of an \u201cexcluded employee\u201d in theAct of 1952. In fact, this expression comes in operation for thepurpose of exclusion of certain employees from compulsion tojoin the Fund created under the Scheme of 1952. Therefore, thisexpression is defined only in the Scheme of 1952, in clause (f) ofparagraph 2 thereof. [Para 9.2.1] [79-E-F]3. Paragraph 26 of the Scheme of 1952 specifies the classesof employees entitled to, and required to, join the Fund as alsothe co-related aspects. The expression \u201cFund\u201d, as occurring inParagraph 26 refers to the Fund created under the Scheme of1952. In the scheme and structure of the Act of 1952, it is butclear that for the specified establishments or class ofestablishments, the Central Government was to frame a Scheme,to be called \u201cthe Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Scheme\u201d; and soonafter framing of such Scheme, a Fund was to be established, whichwas to vest in, and administered by, the Board constituted underSection 5A. The expression \u201cFund\u201d is defined in the Act of 1952to mean the provident fund established under a Scheme; and theexpression \u201cScheme\u201d is defined to mean the EmployeesProvident Fund Scheme framed under Section 5. Indisputably,the Scheme of 1952 is the one framed by the Central Governmentin exercise of the powers conferred by Section 5. [Paras 9.2.2and 11] [80-D; 85-C-E]4. By virtue of sub-section (1) of Section 17, anestablishment could be exempted from the operation of all orany of the provisions of any Scheme if: (a) in regard to theestablishment to which the Act applies, the appropriateGovernment is of opinion that the rules of its provident fund,with respect to the rates of contributions, are not less favourablefor the employees than those specified in Section 6 and theemployees are in enjoyment of other provident fund benefitswhich, on the whole, are not less favourable than the benefitsavailable under the Act or under the Scheme in relation to anyother establishment of similar character; and (b) in regard to anyother establishment, the appropriate Government is of opinion63that benefits in the nature of provident fund, pension or gratuity,as available to the employees of such establishment are, on thewhole, not less favourable than the benefits provided under theAct or any Scheme in any other establishment of similar character.[Para 12] [85-F-H; 86-A]5. When an exemption is granted to an establishment underclause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 17 of the Act of 1952,several duties are cast upon the employer as specified in sub\u0002section (1-A) thereof, with penal provisions in the event of default.The employees are expected to be covered by the Scheme framedunder Section 5 of the Act of 1952 with the exception being thatin case of availability of equivalent or more favourable benefits inan establishment, the appropriate Government could grantexemption. As per sub-section (2) of Section 17, even the Schememay make a provision for exemption but the basic requirementbeing again that the persons or the class of persons to beexempted are entitled to such benefits which are, on the whole,not less favourable than the benefits provided under the Act andthe Scheme thereunder i.e., the Scheme of 1952. All therequirements of Section 17 make the position undoubtedly clearthat the provisions are intended to ensure optimum benefits forthe employees and even the exemption is granted only on thesatisfaction of appropriate Government about existence ofequivalent or more favourable provident fund Scheme for theemployees concerned. [Para 12.1] [86-B-E]6. The provisions of the Scheme are generally madeapplicable, subject to the provisions of Sections 16 and 17 of theAct, to all the factories and other establishments to which theAct applies or is applied under sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section1 or under Section 3 of the Act. The provisions of the Scheme of1952 have been extended to various establishments from timeto time under clause (b) of sub-paragraph (3) of Paragraph 1thereof. As per Paragraph 26 of the Scheme of 1952, everyemployee employed in or in connection with the work of thefactory or other establishment to which this Scheme applies, isentitled to, and is obliged to, become a member of the Fund fromthe date the Scheme would come into force for such factory orMODERN TRANSPORTATION CONSULTATION SERVICES PVT.LTD. v. C.P.F. COMMNR. E.P.F.O.64 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.establishment, except the \u201cexcluded employees\u201d. Significantly,even an \u201cexcluded employee\u201d, on ceasing to be so i.e., on ceasingto be an \u201cexcluded employee\u201d, is entitled to, and is required to,become a member of the Fund from the date of such cessation.[Para 13] [86-F; 87-A-C]7. In the framework of the Scheme of 1952, exclusion isprovided under clause (i) of Paragraph 2(f) thereof to an employeewho had been a member of the Fund and had withdrawn full amountof his accumulations in the Fund under clause (a) or (c) ofParagraph 69(1). Clause (a) of the Paragraph 69(1) of the Schemeof 1952 refers to a member who would withdraw the full amountstanding to his credit in the Fund on retirement from serviceafter attaining the age of 55 years. A comprehensive look atvarious clauses of paragraph 69(1) makes it clear that referencetherein is to a member of the Fund who withdraws full amountstanding to his credit for different eventualities like regularretirement; retirement for disablement or incapacity; migrationfrom the country; termination of service; accepting a voluntaryretirement scheme; closure of the factory; transfer from a coveredfactory or establishment to another factory or establishment notcovered under the Act etc. [Para 13.1] [87-C-D, E-F]8. In the setup and structure of the Act of 1952, specificdistinction is maintained between the Fund, which is created bythe Central Government under Section 5(1) of the Act and anyother provident fund, which is created by an employer.Significantly, clause (f) of Paragraph 2 of the Scheme of 1952 refersto \u201cthe Fund\u201d and not to \u201cany Fund\u201d; and Paragraphs 26 and 69also refer to \u201cthe Fund\u201d and not to \u201cany Fund\u201d. The determiner\u201cthe\u201d, as occurring in Paragraph 2(f) as also Paragraph 69 beforethe expression \u201cFund\u201d makes it clear that the reference thereinis only to the Fund which is created under the Scheme of 1952and it is not a general reference to any Fund. The requirement ofjoining the Fund under Paragraph 26 is also of joining that Fundwhich is created under the Scheme of 1952. In other words,obviously and undoubtedly, the Fund referred to in Paragraphs2(f), 26 and 69 of the Scheme of 1952 is that Fund, which is createdunder the Scheme of 1952 and the reference is not to any other65Fund. Thus, to be covered under the expression \u201cexcludedemployee\u201d by virtue of clause (i) of paragraph 2(f) read with clause(a) of paragraph 69(1), the employee must be such who was amember of the Fund established under the Scheme of 1952 andwho had withdrawn full amount of his accumulations in the saidFund on retirement from service after attaining the age of 55years. [Para 14.1] [88-B-E]9. Therefore, the retired Railway employees, who hadwithdrawn their accumulations in General Provident Fund or anyother Fund of which they were members, could not have beentreated as \u201cexcluded employees\u201d for the purpose of the Schemeof 1952 for the reason that such a withdrawal had not been fromthe Fund established under the Scheme of 1952. In fact, therewas no occasion for them to make any withdrawal from the Fundestablished under the Scheme of 1952 because they were neverthe members of the said Fund. In other words, the employees inquestion were not answering to the requirements of clause (i) ofparagraph 2(f) read with clause (a) of paragraph 69(1) of theScheme of 1952 and hence, were not the \u201cexcluded employees\u201d.[Para 14.2] [88-F-H; 89-A]10. The provisions of the Act and the stipulations of theScheme of 1952 are mandatory in character and the applicationthereof could not have been averted by the appellants or the saidemployees except on certain eventualities as mentioned inSection 17 of the Act as also Paragraph 26 of the Scheme of 1952.Such eventualities are indeed non-existent in the present matter.So far the aspect relating to age is concerned, the operation andeffect of the Act and the Scheme of 1952 are not restricted withreference to any age limit of the employee. Such a suggestionrelating to the age of the employees had been entirely baselessand has rightly been disapproved. [Para 15] [89-C-D]11. So far as the plea of the appellants that they had appliedfor exemption and no decision was taken on their representationis concerned, it is noticed that the appellant had not made anysuch submission that they had any better and beneficial schemefor their employees. In any case, there is no concept of anyholidaying in payment of contribution by the employer by merelyMODERN TRANSPORTATION CONSULTATION SERVICES PVT.LTD. v. C.P.F. COMMNR. E.P.F.O.66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.moving an application for exemption; and when there was no orderof exemption under Section 17 by the competent authority, theappellant-company was under the liability to make payment of itscontribution. [Para 15.1] [89-E-F]12. The observations by the Single Judge of High Courtthat clause (i) of Paragraph 2(f) of the Scheme of 1952 has to beapplied in relation to the withdrawal from any Provident Fundand else, an employee may keep on successively deriving benefits,remain rather unwarranted because the principle underlying theenactment and the Scheme of 1952 is to provide financial securityto the employees. The concept of exclusion from the Scheme of1952 is limited to the class/es of employees mentioned inParagraph 2(f) only; and the area of operation of this exclusionclause cannot be expanded by way of an assumption about thealleged extra advantage likely to be driven home by an employee.In fact, even the assumption of the Single Judge does not appearapt in the framework of the Act and the Scheme of 1952. Whateveran employee gets by virtue of the Act of 1952 is basically theaccumulation in his provident fund account, where he and hisemployer do contribute. The order passed by the Single Judge,being based on entirely irrelevant considerations, has rightly beendisapproved by the Division Bench of High Court. [Para 16][89-G-H; 90-A-D]13. The framework and setup of the Scheme of 1952, theconcept remains plain and clear that if a person is member of theFund created thereunder i.e., under the Scheme of 1952 andwithdraws all his accumulations therein, he may not be obliged tobe a member of the same Fund under the Scheme of 1952 overagain and could be treated as an \u201cexcluded employees\u201d. However,such is not the relaxation granted in relation to an employee whowas earlier a member of any other Fund but later on joins such anestablishment where he would be entitled to membership of theFund created under the Scheme of 1952. This framework of theprovisions and stipulations appears to be best serving the interestof employees, while providing them with continued financialsecurity. [Para 17] [90-E-G]"

The act of directing remand of an accused is held tobe a judicial function and the challenge to the order of remand isnot to be entertained in a habeas corpus petition. In the instantcase, as on the date when the matter was considered by the HighCourt and the Order was passed by it, not only were thereorders of remand passed by the Judicial Magistrate as well asthe Special Court, Gurugram but there was also an order ofextension passed by the Central Government on 14.12.2018. Thelegality, validity and correctness of the order or remand couldhave been challenged by the original Writ Petitioners by filingappropriate proceedings. However, they did not raise suchchallenge before the competent Appellate or Revisional Forum.The orders of remand passed by the Judicial Magistrate and theSpecial Court, Gurugram had dealt with merits of the matter andwhether continued detention of the accused was justified or not.After going into the relevant issues on merits, the accused were93remanded to further police custody. These orders were not putin challenge before the High Court. It was, therefore, not opento the High Court to entertain challenge with regard tocorrectness of those orders. The High Court, however,considered the matter from the standpoint whether the initialOrder of arrest itself was valid or not and found that such legalitycould not be sanctified by subsequent Order of remand.Principally, the issue which was raised before the High Courtwas whether the arrest could be effected after period ofinvestigation, as stipulated in said order dated 20.06.2018 hadcome to an end. The supplementary issue was the effect ofextension of time as granted on 14.12.2018. The arrest waseffected when the period had expired but by the time the HighCourt entertained the petition, there was as order of extensionpassed by Central Government on 14.12.2018. Additionally, therewere judicial orders passed by the Judicial Magistrate as well asthe Special Court, Gurugram, remanding the accused to custody.The High Court was not justified in entertaining the petition andpassing the Order.

Soon after the arrest, the accused were producedbefore the Judicial Magistrate, Gurugram on 11.12.2018, whoremanded them to custody till 14.12.2018 and directed that theybe produced before the Special Court, Gurugram on 14.12.2018.Accordingly the accused were produced before the Special Court,Gurugram, who thereafter remanded them to custody first till18.12.2018 and later till 21.12.2018. The Special Court, Gurugramwould be competent to deal with the matter in terms of Section436. Petitioners, however, submitted that since the accused werearrested in Delhi, were kept in custody in Delhi, and the SFIOoffice being in Delhi, the High Court of Delhi was competent toentertain and consider the writ petitions so preferred by the writpetitioners. [Para 21] [123-E-H; 124-A-B]Navinchandra N. Majithia v. State of Maharashtra andOthers (2000) 7 SCC 640 : [2000] 3 Suppl. SCR 82;Dashrath Rupsingh Radhod v. State of Maharashtraand Another (2014) 9 SCC 129 : [1999] 3 Suppl. SCR271 - referred to.1.3 In the instant case, it cannot be said that the High Courtcompletely lacked jurisdiction to entertain the petition. However,since the challenge was with respect to the detention pursuantto valid remand orders passed by the Judicial Magistrate andthe Special Court, Gurugram, the High Court should not haveentertained the challenge. If the act of directing remand isfundamentally a judicial function, correctness or validity of suchorders could, if at all, be tested in a properly institutedproceedings before the appellate or revisional forum. In thecircumstances even if the arrests were effected within thejurisdiction of the High Court, since the accused were producedbefore a competent court in pursuance of Sections 435, 436 of2013 Act, the High Court ought not to have entertained the writpetition. However, since the High Court considered the matterfrom the standpoint whether the initial Order of arrest itself wasvalid or not and then found that such illegality could not besanctified by subsequent Order of remand. [Para 24] [125-G-H;126-A-C]1.4 Reading of the provisions of 2013 Act shows thatcertain Sections in Chapter XXIX prescribe punishment for95offences such as fraud, false statement, false evidence andwithholding of property under Sections 447, 448, 449 and 452respectively. The punishment for fraud involving an amount of atleast Rs.10 lakhs or 1 per cent of the turnover of the Company,is imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years. Theoffence of fraud in relation to the affairs of a Company isconsidered to be a grave offence and the writ petitioners wereallegedly guilty of such offence. Chapter XIV of 2013 Act dealswith Inspection, Inquiry and Investigation. Under Section 210,investigation into the affairs of a Company can be undertaken.Section 211 contemplates establishment of Serious FraudInvestigation Offence (SFIO) which is to be headed by aDirector and is to consist of Experts with ability, integrity andexperience in fields like Banking, Corporate Affairs, Taxation,Forensic Audit, Capital Market, Information Technology, Law orsuch other fields. SFIO headed by a Director is thus a compactand competent unit consisting of experts in various domains.Section 212 empowers the Central Government to assign theinvestigation into the affairs of a Company to SFIO. Upon suchassignment the Director SFIO may designate such number ofinspectors under sub-Section (1) and shall cause the affairs ofthe Company to be investigated by an Investigating Officerunder sub-Section (4). The expression used in sub-Section (1) is\u201cassign the investigation\u201d. Sub-Section (2) incorporates animportant principle that upon such assignment by the CentralGovernment to SFIO, no other investigating agency of theCentral Government or any State Government can proceed withinvestigation in respect of any offence punishable under 2013Act and is bound to transfer the documents and records inrespect of such offence under 2013 Act to SFIO. [Para 26][132-C-H]1.5 Under sub-Section (3) where the investigation is soassigned by the Central Government to SFIO, the investigationmust be conducted in the manner and in accordance with theprocedure provided in the Chapter and a report has to besubmitted to the Central Government within such period as maybe specified. This provision contemplates submission of a reportwithin the period as may be specified. The subsequentprovisions then contemplate various stages of investigationSERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v. RAHUL MODI96 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.including arrest under sub-Section (8) and that SFIO is to submitan interim report to the Central Government, if it is so directedunder sub Section (11). Further, according to sub-Section (12),on completion of the investigation, SFIO is to submit the\u201cinvestigation report\u201d to the Central Government. This reportunder sub-Section (12) may lead to further follow up actions.Under sub-Section (13) a copy of the \u201cinvestigation report\u201d couldbe obtained by any concerned person by making an application inthat behalf to the Court while under sub-Section (14) on receiptof said \u201cinvestigation report\u201d the Central Government maydirect SFIO to initiate prosecution against the Company. The\u201cinvestigation report\u201d under sub-Section (12) is to be submittedon completion of the investigation whereas report undersub-Section (11) is in the nature of an interim report and is to besubmitted if the Central Government so directs. The provisionsof Section 43(2) of 2008 Act do not postulate any such period andthe assignment in the present case to SFIO was under theconcerned provisions of 2013 Act as well as under 2008 Act.[Para 27] [133-A-F]1.6 Section 212(3) of 2013 Act by itself does not lay downany fixed period within which the report has to be submitted.Even under sub-Section (12) which is regarding \u201cinvestigationreport\u201d, again there is no stipulation of any period. In fact such areport under sub-Section (12) is to be submitted \u201con completionof the investigation\u201d. There is no stipulation of any fixed periodfor completion of investigation which is consistent with normalprinciples under the general law. If the investigation proceedsfor a longer period, under Section 167 of the Code certain rightsmay flow in favour of the accused. But it is certainly not the ideathat in case the investigation is not over within any fixed period,the authority to investigate would come to an end. Sub-Section(2) of Section 213 of 2013 Act does not speak of any period forwhich the other Investigating Agencies are to hold their hands,nor does the provision speak of any re-transfer of the relevantdocuments and records from SFIO back to said InvestigatingAgencies after any period or occurring of an event. [Para 28][133-F-H; 134-A-C]971.7 The very expression \u201cassign\u201d in Section 212(3) of 2013Act contemplates transfer of investigation for all purposeswhereafter the original Investigating Agencies of the CentralGovernment or any State Government are completely denudedof any power to conduct and complete the investigation inrespect of the offences contemplated therein. The idea undersub-Section (2) is complete transfer of investigation. Thetransfer under sub-Section (2) of Section 213 would not standrevoked or recalled in any contingency. If a time limit isconstrued and contemplated within which the investigation mustbe completed then logically, the provisions would have dealt withas to what must happen if the time limit is not adhered to. TheStatute must also have contemplated a situation that a validinvestigation undertaken by any Investigating Agency of CentralGovernment or State Government which was transferred to SFIO,must then be re-transferred to said Investigating Agencies. Butthe Statute does not contemplate that. The transfer isirrevocable and cannot be recalled in any manner. Once assigned,SFIO continues to have the power to conduct and completeinvestigation. If that be so, can such power stand curtailed ordiminished if the investigation is not completed within aparticular period. The Statute has not prescribed any period forcompletion of investigation. The prescription in the instant casecame in the order of 20.06.2018. [Para 29] [134-D-G; 135-A]Kazi Lhendup Dorji v. State of Sikkim & Ors (1994) 2Suppl. SCC 116 - referred to.1.8 It is well settled that while laying down a particularprocedure if no negative or adverse consequences arecontemplated for non-adherence to such procedure, the relevantprovision is normally not taken to be mandatory and isconsidered to be purely directory. Furthermore, the provisionhas to be seen in the context in which it occurs in the Statute.There are three basic features which are present in this matter;absolute transfer of investigation in terms of Section 212(2) of2013 Act in favour of SFIO and upon such transfer all documentsand records are required to be transferred to SFIO by every otherSERIOUS FRAUD INVESTIGATION OFFICE v. RAHUL MODI98 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.Investigating Agency; for completion of investigation,sub-Section (12) of Section 212 does not contemplate anyperiod; and under sub-Section (11) of Section 212 there could beinterim reports as and when directed. In the face of the salientfeatures it cannot be said that the prescription of period withinwhich a report is to be submitted by SFIO under sub-Section (3)of Section 212 is for completion of period of investigation and onthe expiry of that period the mandate in favour of SFIO mustcome to an end. If it was to come to an end, the legislation wouldhave contemplated certain results including re-transfer ofinvestigation back to the original Investigating Agencies whichwere directed to transfer the entire record under sub-Section (2)of Section 212. In the absence of any clear stipulation, aninterpretation that with the expiry of the period, the mandate infavour of SFIO must come to an end, will cause great violence tothe scheme of legislation. If such interpretation is accepted, withthe transfer of investigation in terms of sub Section (2) of Section212 the original Investigating Agencies would be denuded ofpower to investigate and with the expiry of mandate SFIO wouldalso be powerless which would lead to an incongruous situationthat serious frauds would remain beyond investigation. That couldnever have been the idea. The only construction which is,possible therefore, is that the prescription of period within whicha report has to be submitted to the Central Government undersub-Section (3) of Section 212 is purely directory. Even after theexpiry of such stipulated period, the mandate in favour of theSFIO and the assignment of investigation under sub-Section (1)would not come to an end. The only logical end as contemplatedis after completion of investigation when a final report or\u201cinvestigation report\u201d is submitted in terms of sub-Section (12)of Section 212. It cannot therefore, be said that the mandate cameto an end on 19.09.2018 and the arrest effected on 10.12.2018under the orders passed by Director, SFIO was in any way illegalor unauthorised by law. In any case, extension was granted in theinstant case by the Central Government on 14.12.2018. But thatis completely besides the point since the original arrest itselfwas not in any way illegal. The High Court completely erred inproceeding on that premise and in passing the order underappeal, and thus, is set aside. [Para 30, 31] [135-B-H; 136-A-D"

[2019] 5 S.C.R. 139 139140 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.Allowing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1. The controversy before this Court is now in anarrow compass, on account of the subsequent judicialpronouncement in SRD Nutrients Pvt. Ltd. v. Commissioner ofCentral Excise, Guwahati. The issue of the Education Cess andthe Secondary & Higher Education Cess, is covered against theDepartment in view of this judgment and that is how, also, theDepartment appears to have understood now, in view of thewritten synopsis placed before this Court. In the facts of thatcase, there was an initiative for development of industries in theNorth-Eastern States of Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram,Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, etc. A Notificationexempting goods from payment of excise duties was issued inrespect of those States. Education Cess and Secondary & HigherEducation Cess, as imposed under the Finance Acts of 2004 and2007, respectively were also sought to be levied on the appellanttherein. The gravamen of the reasoning of this Court is thatsince these cesses are a surcharge levied and collected on thetotal value of the excise duty, and the excise duty itself isexempted, there cannot be any question of any recovery of thesecesses, as the substratum does not exist. Not only that, thisCourt also took into account how the Department itself had viewedthe situation regarding Education Cess and Secondary & HigherEducation Cess, which are payable as surcharge on the exciseduty, once the excise duty is exempted. The Circular dated10.08.2004 issued by the Department also clarified this position.Therefore, the result of the aforesaid discussion is that theappellant is not liable to pay Education Cess and Secondary &Higher Education Cess. [Paras 12, 13 and 24] [146-G; 151-A]3. The real bone of contention which survives forconsideration is the NCCD. The reason for this is that while thetwo cesses discussed aforesaid were in the nature of levy on theexcise duty payable, the NCCD is levied on the product itself, asper Section 136 of the Finance Act, 2001. It is this aspect, interalia, which was canvassed by the Department to persuade thisCourt to take a different view from the one taken qua the othertwo cesses. [Para 16] [149-A-B]1414. On a proper appreciation of the judicial pronouncementin SRD Nutrients Pvt. Ltd., this Court is not inclined to take adifferent view from the one taken for Education Cess andSecondary & Higher Education Cess, even while considering theissue of NCCD. [Para 21] [150-C]5. In SRD Nutrients Pvt. Ltd. gave its imprimatur to theview expressed by the Rajasthan High Court in Banswara SyntexLtd. The rationale is that while there may be surcharges underdifferent financial enactments to provide the Government withrevenue for specified purposes, the same have been notified asleviable in the nature of a particular kind of duty. In the case ofNCCD, it is in the nature of an excise duty. It has to bear thesame character as those respective taxes to which the surchargeis appended. NCCD will not cease to be an excise duty, but isthe same as an excise duty, even if it is levied on the product.Thus, when NCCD, at the time of collection, takes the characterof a duty on the product, whatever may be the rationale behind it,it is also subject to the provisions relating to excise duty,applicable to it in the manner of collection as well as theobligation of the taxpayer to discharge the duty. Once the exciseduty is exempted, NCCD, levied as an excise duty cannotpartake a different character and, thus, would be entitled to thebenefit of the exemption notification. The exemptionnotification also states that the exemption is from the \u201cwhole ofthe duty of excise or additional duty of excise.\u201d Thus, theappellant would not be liable to pay the NCCD.

The clauseinterdicts raising claim for compensation by the contractor if theemployer poses hindrance to the work. If work gets delayed onaccount of the contractor himself, it is axiomatic that he cannotclaim compensation as it would amount to a person takingadvantage of his own wrong. Delay from any cause cannot founda claim for compensation. It may also happen that the work mayget delayed not due to the fault of the employer. There may benatural causes such as natural calamities which may cause delayin carrying out the work. Even in such cases, Clause 59 cast anembargo against a claim by the contractor.

SUPERINTENDING ENGR T.B.P.H.L.C.156 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.whatsoever\u2019. Equally, if there is hindrance to the work from anycause whatever, a claim for compensation would not lie. Whilecompensation on account of delay and hindrance is impermissible,what Clause 59 provides however, is that reasonable extensionof time be allowed. Request for extension of time must arisefrom causes beyond the control of the contractor.[Paras 26, 27] [171-C-G]1.2 Claim No.1 relates to claim for extra lead for carryingout the work of quarrying stone and metal from a quarry locatedat a greater distance from the work site. As far as the said claimis concerned, it cannot be associated with a delay to the work forany cause whatever within the meaning of Clause 59. The claim,on the other hand is, on account of the appellant carrying outwork of quarrying from a site which was located further away thanthe site which was specified under the contract. [Paras 29, 30][172-D-E; 173-D]1.3 The claim for Rs.15/- per cu.m. was based on abnormalincrease in transport charges due to increase in cost of fuel,automobile spare parts etc. If escalated rates are claimed then itmay attract the wrath of Clause 59. The claim of extra lead cannotbe denied. The claim of Rs.15/- per cu.m., if it is over and abovethe amount which is already received will be in the teeth of thecontractual provision which is relied on by the sub Court for whichhe has not taken any exception to in which case the amount asordered by the sub Court is to be awarded to him under thisclaim. This means the amount is to be worked out as provided inthe letter dated 13.11.1982. In other words, the amount must beawarded on the basis of the cost of conveyance being calculatedat the rate of Rs.13.75 and the amount must be calculated andpaid by exercising power under Article 142 to sustain the decisionof the Sub Court under this claim. [Para 41] [177-G-H; 178-A-C]2. Non-supply of food grains as per the conditions of theagreement2.1 The original tender conditions contemplated supply ofwheat at Rs.115/- per quintal, if available. The appellant was to157supply the food grains only if the food grains were made availableby the Government. Therefore, it is totally untenable for theappellant to set up a case that attracted by the clause whichresulted from the representation and negotiation, he submittedhis tender. May be at the time of entering into the contractfollowing his representation and negotiation the clause wasincorporated which provided for supply of rice or wheat and otherterms. In other words, at the time when appellant submitted histender which may have been lesser than the estimated rate byabout 10 to 12%, the negotiated clause was not there. On thisscore, the case sought to be built up around the clause beingattractive cannot be accepted. [Para 53] [184-G-H; 185-A-B]2.2 As regards the supply of food grains, the appellant isnot correct in having contended that the appellant was duty boundto supply food grain even if the food grains were not supplied bythe department. A perusal of the clause relating to supply of foodgrain would show that food grains would be supplied, if available.Again, the words \u201cif offered\u201d is conspicuous. The words in theclause which provided that the appellant shall supply food grainto the labourers is not to be considered in isolation.[Para 54] [185-B-D]2.3 The sub Court was right in holding that thecorrespondence referred to by the arbitrator did not show thatthe food grains were actually available with the department anddepartment was only trying to get the food grains from theadministration with which the food grains was available. No doubtthe contractual provision which provides that the appellant is tokeep accounts and produce accounts relating to receipts anddistribution may assume relevance when appellant receives foodgrains from the department and distributes. But at the sametime the appellant is putting up the claim for compensation andthat too a claim which runs into a fairly large sum. There wouldcertainly be material to evidence the actual purchase and furtheractual supply to the workers or payment as alleged. Evenassuming everything that the appellant says is correct about thefact of the negotiated settlement, there is virtually no materialSRI K. MARAPPAN (D) THR.SOLE LR.BALASUBRAMANIAN v. SUPERINTENDING ENGR T.B.P.H.L.C.158 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.except the appellants statement that the appellant paid for theprice of food grains to the workers. Further, the claim involvespayment of price of rice at escalated rates for period beyond thecontract also and it invites the wrath of Clause 59. The award ofthe claim by the arbitrator cannot be sustained. [Para 63][188-G-H; 189-A-C]3. Reimbursement of short supply of cement.3.1 The claim is not hit by Clause 59 as the appellant wasnot claiming compensation for any delay. The Sub-Court whilesetting aside the award had held that Cement is a controlledcommodity and it could not be purchased from outside, withoutvalid permit. It was found that the appellant did not produce anydocument to show that cement was actually purchased fromoutside. The source was not mentioned. The appellant did notproduce any permission from the Department for purchasingcement from outside. Even if purchased, it was to be checked bycheck measure but there was no check measurement. The tabularstatement shown by the appellant, only represents the theoreticalrequirement in the quantity of cement. In the letters of theOfficers, there is no reference about the use of cement by theappellant which was brought from outside. The letters written bythe appellant also complained only of inadequacy of supply ofcement and there is no mention of use of cement which he broughtfrom outside. More importantly, he referred to the contractualprovision to find that the Government is entitled to recover thecost of theoretical quantity which is not used and use of any lesseramount in comparison to theoretical amount would only enure tothe Department. The contract provides that cement will besupplied at cost by the Department inter alia and the cost of cementissued will be recovered from the contractor\u2019s bill at the ratespecified. The contract also contains the theoretical requirementof important materials which include cement. The rate of recoveryis shown as Rs.416/- per metric tonne.[Paras 67-69] [191-A-G]3.2 A perusal of the contractual provisions yields thefollowing inevitable result. Cement is a scarce material to besupplied by the Department. The appellant was to maintainseparate ledger for the item for which cement was supplied bythe Department. The issue price was Rs.416/- per metric tonne.159The cost of cement at the said rate was to be recovered from theappellant\u2019s bill at the issue rate. Thus, if the value of the work isRs.100/- and the value of the cement is Rs.5/-, the appellant wouldget only Rs.95/-. There are theoretical requirements in regardto the use of cement. It is not unnatural for the Department toprescribe for the theoretical requirement. This is to ensure thatit is used exactly as per the theoretical requirement so that thestructure on the one hand is built in a safe manner and at thesame time nothing in excess is used so as to avoid wastage ofscarce material. There are three situations which arecontemplated. In the first situation, it is provided that if materialsare drawn according to the schedule and are short used then theexcess quantity is to be returned to the Department in goodcondition and for the same the contractor will not get any payment.Furthermore, if the short-used material is not returned to theDepartment, their cost will be recovered at the market rate or atthe issue rate which is greater plus wastage charges and salestax. The second situation is where the materials are drawn inexcess of theoretical requirements. The contract contemplatesthat in such a situation, the excess drawn quantity must bereturned to the Department in good condition and otherwise therewill be recovery at the issue rate plus 100% surcharge or marketrate whichever is higher plus storage and taxes. The thirdsituation contemplated is that if the materials are short drawn orshort used it is specifically provided that in such a situation, thesaving due to short drawal/ use should be secured to theGovernment by recovering the cost thereto at issue rate fromthe contractor. Further, the contract contemplates that if materialsare required to be procured by the contractor, he must maintainseparate ledger for each of the item which are so required to beprocured by the contractor. [Paras 71-74] [193-C-H; 194-A-E]3.3 In respect of short used material, though, properlydrawn the recovery would be in addition to the recovery for thecost of materials which is returned. This would mean that if theappellant had indeed secured cement from outside, the appellantwas obliged under the Contract to maintain a separate ledger.Further the Contract contemplates that there could be recoveryfrom the bill of the Contractor for the cost of cement which isSRI K. MARAPPAN (D) THR.SOLE LR.BALASUBRAMANIAN v. SUPERINTENDING ENGR T.B.P.H.L.C.160 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.actually not supplied to the contractor and it will be based on thetheoretical requirement. Thus, the mere fact that there has beenexcess recovery meaning thereby that without issuing the cementto the appellant the amounts have been recovered would not meanthat the appellant would be able to substantiate his claim thatthere was inadequate supply of cement. That is a matter whichmust be substantiated with reference to other material. Fromthe correspondence, it would appear that the officers proceededon the basis that there is a shortage of cement. Therefore, thisappears to be a case where sufficient cement may not have beensupplied to the appellant. However, under Clause 10 of theagreement no right to compensation lies for short supply ofcement. There is no indication in any of the letters written by theappellant which the other sources were from which he wasprocuring cement. The most important obstacle for the appellantis the clause in the contract namely, for procuring cement by thecontractor, he must maintain ledger and which may be open toscrutiny by the officer as and when demanded. In this case, theappellant has not produced any ledger showing purchase ofcement from other sources. There is no written permissionproduced to purchase cement from other sources. No voucherhas been produced by the appellant to establish purchase ofcement from outside. [Paras 74, 75, 80, 82] [174-D, F-H;196-F-G; 197-D-F]3.4 A party is supposed to produce the best evidence orrather the evidence which under the contract is contemplated.The failure on the part of the appellant to produce the ledger hasfatal consequences. The matter becomes further aggravated bythe failure on the part of the appellant to even produce vouchersor bills in support of the claim to purchase the cement from outsidesources. A contractor may have without written permission butfor the purpose of the work purchased cement from outside. Butcertainly, the fact that there are neither vouchers nor any ledgerentries nor bills produced to hold that the matter may warrantinterference with the award under Section 30. The claim is notaccepted. [Para 86] [198-G-H; 199-A-C]4. Claim on account of stock of materials accumulated bythe contractor for work in the project.161As regards this claim, the claim appears to be that appellantcollected materials and it was lying at the site. Admittedly, theappellant has not used this material for the purpose of doing thework. Only the case set up by the appellant is that he was givenan assurance that he will be permitted to carry out the work andtherefore, since he has spent money for the same, he must getthe amount which is claimed for having spent on the material.Insofar as the appellant has not used any of the materials to carryout the work and sets up the claim only on the basis of assurancewhich has not been admitted, the action of the appellant inpurchasing the materials cannot result in establishing his claimfor compensation. The appellant raised a claim for enhancedcompensation. He alleged that there was delay on the part of therespondent on various grounds. This is apart from alleging otherfactors like breakout of malaria, unfavourable weather and delayin taking decision by the departmental officers, which contributedto escalation in cost. Correspondence was exchanged with theExecutive Engineer and the Superintending Engineer, theSuperintending Engineer and the Chief Engineer and finallybetween the Chief Engineer and the Government. It appearsthat at that stage appellant invoked the arbitration clause and apanel of arbitrators gave their award. In fact, the work itself wasstopped. Clause 59 prevents the Court from awardingcompensation on account of any factor relating to the delay whichmay be due to any cause whatsoever. In such circumstances, theappellant has also not made out any cause for compensation inregard to this claim. [Para 87] [199-C-H]5. Interest of 18% per annum under the Interest Act.As far as the question relating to interest is concerned, thearbitrator has awarded interest at 12% from the date of the claimbut excluded interest from commencement of proceeding till dateof award. As long as the agreement between the parties doesnot prohibit grant of interest and the matter is referred to thearbitrator, arbitrator would have power to grant interest pendentelite. The sub Court was not justified in setting aside interest andthe interest as awarded by the arbitrator is restored.[Paras 88, 89] [200-A-C; 201-C]"

On 24 October, 1980 section 170B was inserted intothe provisions of the MP Land Revenue Code 1959 by MP Act15 of 1980. Pursuant thereto, predecessor-in-interest of appellantinitiated proceeding u/s.170B of the code, which was ordered inhis favour. Writ petition challenging the said order in wasdismissed. Thereafter, predecessor-in-interest of respondent filedsuit to declare the said order u/s. 170B as null and void, whichwas also dismissed by the Trial Court. However, in the first appealorder of the Trial Court was set aside. The second appeal filed bythe appellant was dismissed. Hence, present Special LeavePetition.Allowing the appeal, the CourtHELD: The basic issue which falls for consideration iswhether it was open to the respondent to institute a suit tochallenge the order passed by the Collector, when an earlierchallenge to the legality of the order had culminated in the finaljudgment of the High Court in writ proceedings on 16 February1987. The answer to that issue must lie in the negative. Theorder of the Collector was placed in issue before the High Courtin writ proceedings. The order which has been extracted in theearlier part of the judgment indicates that the challenge was onthe ground that the notice of the appeal before the Collector hadnot been served on the original respondent. The judgment ofthe High Court enquired into the legality of the order passed bythe Collector. The High Court came to the conclusion that theorder was in accordance with law. The writ petition was dismissed.Once the order of the Collector was affirmed in the final judgmentand order of the High Court dated 16 February 1987, it was notopen to a civil court to arrive at a conclusion to the contrary. TheHigh Court, in second appeal has manifestly erred in ignoringthe clear effect of the earlier order dated 16 February 1987.[Para 13] [209-C-E]"

The sum insured was Rs.75,000/-. Term of the policy wastwenty five years. Policy envisaged the payment of quarterlypremium of Rs 775/-, spread over hundred quarters during theterm of the policy. Last premium was payable in August, 2018and the policy was to mature in Nov. 18. In 2001, the appellanttook loan of Rs.15,000/- by pledging the policy. In August, 2001the appellant stopped paying the premium and applied for therefund of the surrender value. The Corporation offered surrendervalue of Rs.2268/-, after deducting the loan amount andoutstanding interest. Appellant filed complaint before the DistrictConsumer Forum, which was allowed. The State Commissionaffirmed the said decision, which was reversed by NationalCommission in revision. Hence, the present appeal.Dismissing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 There are popular misconceptions about theconcept of \u2018surrender value\u2019 in the sphere of life insurance. In aANANDRAO RAMCHANDRA SALUNKE v. L I.C. OF INDIA212 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.policy of fire insurance, a policy holder has no expectation of asurrender value. In contrast, a holder of a policy of life insurancemay believe (as the appellant in this case does) that theirsurrender value will be equal to the total amount paid as premium.This expectation is misconceived. Life insurance operates onthe basis of the law of averages. Premium is collected from allpolicy holders in order to create a common fund. Payouts fromthe fund are received only by those who suffer the peril which isinsured. The economic loss suffered by few is divided amongstmany. Premia are fixed by the insurer on the basis of expectedmortality rates. Hypothetically, if mortality rates of all individualswere to be equal irrespective of age and everyone paid the samepremium, the discontinuance of a policy during its term wouldnot entitle the insured to a surrender value since the commonfund would be depleted on a regular basis. In reality, the mortalityrates increase with age. Actuarial tables provide a guide to theinsurer. Hence, when an insurer initially collects premium fromindividuals of a younger age, the amount it collects is higher thanthe amount it pays out towards claims. The difference betweenthem is the \u2018reserve\u2019. Thus if a policy holder wishes to discontinuea policy before the end of the term, they will only be entitled totheir share of the \u2018reserve\u2019 as a surrender value. Since the valueof the \u2018reserve\u2019 is the amount which the insurer collects aspremium from policy holders from which it deducts the amountof the claims it pays out, the surrender value payable to a policyholder can never be equal to the premia paid by them. Incomputing the surrender value of any subsisting bonus, referenceought to be made to the stipulations contained in Section 113,Insurance Act, 1938. The first proviso to Section 113(1) providesthat the requirement of the addition of the surrender value of thebonus attaching to the policy at surrender is deemed to havebeen fulfilled where the method of calculating the guaranteedsurrender value makes provision for the surrender value of thebonus attaching to the policy. The second proviso stipulates thatthe requirement of showing the guaranteed surrender value on apolicy is deemed to have been complied with where the insurershows on the policy the guaranteed surrender value by means ofa formula which is accepted by the authority as satisfying the213requirements under the third proviso. The requirement ofshowing the guaranteed surrender value shall not take effect untilsix months have expired from the date of publication of thenotification in the Official Gazette. [Paras 11, 13 and 16][220-D-G; 221-C; 223-B-C]1.3 Condition 7 of the policy document specifically providesthat the surrender value is equal to 30% of the total premiumspaid, excluding premiums for the first year and all extra premiumsand/or additional premiums for accident benefits that may havebeen paid. The paid up value of the policy on that basis wascomputed by taking into account the premiums that were paid bythe insured. The paid up value of the policy worked out to Rs23,250/-. The factor of 32.92% has been duly explained on thebasis of the actuarial table governing surrender values which hasbeen placed on record. The vested bonus which accrued, stoodat Rs 42,187/- at the rate of Rs 562.5 per Rs 1,000/-, according tothe bonus chart for endowment policies as on 31 March 2001.There was no error on the part of the respondent in computingthe surrender value of the subsisting bonus, on the basis on whichit has been computed. The surrender value of the subsisting bonusattached to the policy cannot be the bonus which would have beenpayable had the policy continued to its full term. In deducing thesurrender value of the bonus which was payable to the appellant,the respondent applied the surrender value factor of 32.92% tothe total paid up value of the policy. The total paid up valuecomprised of the paid up value (Rs 23,250/-) and the vested bonus(Rs 42,187/-). Hence, the total paid up value of the policy wasRs. 65,437/- to which the surrender value factor of 32.92% wasapplied. This resulted in a surrender value of Rs 21,542/-. Whatwas payable to the insured was computed after deducting theloan which was taken against the policy together with theoutstanding interest. The method by which the computation wascarried out was in accordance with the accepted and duly approvedformula. It was consistent with the provisions of Section 113 ofthe Act as they stood at the material time as well as condition 7 ofthe policy document. [Paras 17-20] [223-D-H; 224-A-E]"

Spouse of the first complainant entered theswimming pool with his brother. All of sudden, he becameunconscious and sank into the pool. It was alleged that aforeigner who was in the vicinity lifted him out of water. Later,spouse of the first complainant died. An FIR was registered and [2019] 5 S.C.R. 225 225226 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.thereafter a complaint was filed before the NCDRC. The NCDRCheld that there was a deficiency of service on the part of themanagement of the hotel. Appellant has filed this appeal againstthe order of the NCDRC.Disposing of the appeals, the CourtHELD: 1. Existence of a duty of careIn the instant case, the deceased and the complainant wereguests in the hotel run by the appellant. Since the facility of aswimming pool was available for use by the guests of the hotel,there was a close and proximate relationship between themanagement involving the maintenance of safe conditions in thepool and guests of the hotel using the pool. A hotel which providesa swimming pool for its guests owes a duty of care. The duty ofcare arises from the fact that unless the pool is properlymaintained and supervised by trained personnel, it is likely tobecome a potential source of hazard and danger. Every guestwho enters the pool may not have the same level of proficiencyas a swimmer. The management of the hotel can reasonablyforesee the consequence which may arise if the pool and itsfacilities are not properly maintained. The observance of safetyrequires good physical facilities but in addition, human supervisionover those who use the pool. Allowing or designating a lifeguardto perform the duties of a Bartender is a clear deviation from theduty of care. Mixing drinks does not augur well in preservingthe safety of swimmers. The appellant could have reasonablyforeseen that there could be potential harm caused by the absenceof a dedicated lifeguard. The imposition of such a duty upon theappellant can be considered to be just, fair and reasonable. Thefailure to satisfy this duty of care would amount to a deficiency ofservice on the part of the hotel management. [Para 15][234-B-E]2. Breach of dutyIn the present case, it is an admitted position of the factthat the lifeguard on duty was also functioning as the Bartender,and that a foreigner was the first one to notice the deceaseddrowning in the swimming pool. The breach of the duty of carelies in the fact that while the hotel had made the facility of a227swimming pool available for its guests, it ought to have assigneda lifeguard who would perform his duties only in that capacity.The reasoning of the NCDRC to the effect that a lifeguard onduty should not be distracted by virtue of being assigned otherduties, is eminently fair and proper. Hence, there is no difficultyin holding that there was a breach of the duty of care owed by theappellant. [Paras 19, 20] [236-E-F, G]3. Consequential DamagesThat leaves this Court with the question of damages.Appeals have been filed against the decision both by the KTDCas well as by the original complainants. The deceased was 35years old. He was a partner in a firm engaged in the business oftrading in consumer goods and office automation along with twoother persons. The income tax return for the assessment year2005-06 indicated that he had a gross income of Rs.1,91,000/-The NCDRC has justifiably borne in mind the fact that thedeceased had ample future prospects. Material was producedon the record to indicate that the deceased was carrying onbusiness and also had agricultural income. The young childrenhave been deprived of the support and affection of their father.Their mother has lost the companionship of a spouse. The natureof the loss is incapable of being fully compensated in monetaryterms. Therefore, taking into account the social status of theparties, the income of the deceased, the nature of the business,the prospects for future earnings, the loss of companionship fora spouse and of the guidance and support for the children, theassessment of compensation in the amount of Rs.62,50,000/- bythe NCDRC cannot be faulted.

The appellant had filed application for divorceand custody of minor children in the US Court and order came tobe passed by the US Court. Despite that interim order, theappellant came to India and within 20 days of her arrival in India,filed an application for custody of minor children, in the FamilyCourt in India concealing her application for custody filed in theUS Court. She also did not disclose that an order came to bepassed by the US Court against her. In the given facts andcircumstances, the opinion of the High Court that the minorchildren were not ordinary residents of India as envisaged underSection 9(1) of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, is upheld.Resultantly, the application for custody of minor children filedbefore the Family Court in India is rightly rejected by the HighCourt in exercise of power under Order 7 Rule 11 of CPC. At thesame time, when the orders have been passed by the US Court,the parties cannot disregard the proceedings instituted beforethe US Court filed at the instance of the appellant who issupposed to participate in those proceedings. [Para 31][265-E-H]2.1 Child rights may be limited but they should not beignored or eliminated since children are in fact persons whereinall fundamental rights are guaranteed to them keeping in mindthe best interest of the child and the various other factors whichplay a pivotal role in taking decision to which reference has beenmade taking note of the parental autonomy which courts do noteasily discard. [Para 50] [276-B]LAHARI SAKHAMURI v. SOBHAN KODALI242 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.2.2 It is true that this Court has to keep in mind the bestinterest of the child as the paramount consideration. Theobservations of the US Court clearly show that principle of welfareof the children has been taken into consideration by the US Courtin passing of the order as it reiterates that both the parties arenecessary for proper upbringing of the children and the ultimatedecision of custody and guardianship of the two minor childrenwill be taken by the US which has the exclusive jurisdiction totake the decision as the children happened to be the US citizensand further order been passed on the respondent\u2019s emergencypetition with special release in custody on 9th March, 2018permitting the respondent to apply for US passports on behalf ofthe minor children without appellant being mother\u2019s consent. Theappellant cannot disregard the proceedings instituted at herinstance before the US Court and she must participate in thoseproceedings by engaging solicitors of her choice to espouse hercause. [Para 48] [275-D-F]2.3 The crucial factors which have to be kept in mind bythe Courts for gauging the welfare of the children equally for theparent\u2019s can be inter alia, delineated, such as (1) maturity andjudgment; (2) mental stability; (3) ability to provide access toschools; (4) moral character; (5) ability to provide continuinginvolvement in the community; (6) financial sufficiency and lastbut not the least the factors involving relationship with the child,as opposed to characteristics of the parent as an individual.[Para 49] [285-G]2.4 The expression \u201cbest interest of child\u201d which is alwayskept to be of paramount consideration is indeed wide in itsconnotation and it cannot remain the love and care of the primarycare giver, i.e., the mother in case of the infant or the child who isonly a few years old. The definition of \u201cbest interest of the child\u201dis envisaged in Section 2(9) of the Juvenile Justice (Care &Protection) Act, 2015, as to mean \u201cthe basis for any decisiontaken regarding the child, to ensure fulfilment of his basic rightsand needs, identify, social well-being and physical, emotional andintellectual development\u201d. [Para 43] [273-D-E]2432.5 It is not in dispute that both the minor children, fromthe very inception of their birth, till removal from the US wereliving with their parents in US. This fact was admitted by theappellant also in the guardianship petition filed before the FamilyCourt in India and also in the divorce and custody petition filedby her in US and only after hearing counsel for the parties, orderwas passed by the US Court on 22nd May, 2017 on the emergencycustody petition granting temporary physical custody of thechildren with further direction to the appellant to return alongwith the children to the jurisdiction of US Court on 2nd June, 2017.In case she was aggrieved by the order dated 22nd May, 2017passed by the US Court after affording an opportunity of hearingwhich she contested through her Attorney, all the courses wereavailable to her to assail the order of the Court. Since theappellant failed in returning the children to the jurisdiction of theUS Court despite order dated 22nd May, 2017, there was no optionleft with the respondent but to file a Habeas Corpus Petition andpray that the children be repatriated back to US in compliance ofthe order of the US Court. [Para 47] [274-G-H; 275-A-C]2.6 The best interest of the children being of paramountimportance will be served if they return to US and enjoy theirnatural environment with love, care and attention of their parentsincluding grandparents and to resume their school and be withtheir teachers and peers. [Para 56] [277-F-G]2.7 The doctrines of comity of courts, intimate connect,orders passed by foreign courts having jurisdiction in the matterregarding custody of the minor child, citizenship of the parentsand the child etc., cannot override the consideration of the bestinterest and the welfare of the child and that the direction to returnthe child to the foreign jurisdiction must not result in any physical,mental, psychological, or other harm to the child. Taking a holisticconsideration of the entire case, the Court is satisfied that all thecriteria such as comity of courts, orders of foreign court havingjurisdiction over the matter regarding custody of the children,citizenship of the spouse and the children, intimate connect, andabove all, welfare and best interest of the minor children weighLAHARI SAKHAMURI v. SOBHAN KODALI244 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.in favour of the respondent and that has been looked into by theHigh Court in the impugned judgment in detail. That needs nointerference under Article 136 of the Constitution of India.[Para 51] [276-C-E]3. The judicial resolution of a custody dispute maypermanently affect or even end the parties\u2019 legal relationship butthe social and psychological relationship will usually continue andit seems appropriate that a negotiated resolution between theparents is preferable from the child\u2019s perspective for severalreasons. A child\u2019s future relationship with each of his parentsmay be better maintained and his existing relationship is lessdamaged by a negotiated settlement than by one imposed by acourt after adversarial proceedings. In the present case, there isevery possibility that the parties may reconcile and start overtheir relationship afresh, at least for the sake of happiness oftheir own off-spring if for no other reason. The parties are indeedmature and sensible enough to understand that the ordinary wearand tear of married life has to be put up in within the largerinterests of their own happiness and of the healthy, normal growthand development of their offspring, whom destiny has entrustedto their joint parental care. Spouses must come over thetemperamental disharmony which usually exists in every marriage,rather than magnifying it with impulsive desires and passions.Parents are not only caretakers, but they are instrumental in thedevelopment of their child\u2019s social, emotional, cognitive andphysical well-being and work harmoniously to give their childrena happy home to which they are justly entitled to.[Para 54, 55] [277-B-E]4. The appellant is directed to return to US along with boththe children, within a period of six weeks. Further respondent isdirected to make all arrangements of stay and travelexpenses(including air tickets) of the appellant and both thechildren as well as her companion, if any, in their own house or ifshe is not willing to stay for any personal reasons, make allarrangements for stay at the place of her choice at reasonablecost. In case the appellant reports that she is not inclined totravel to US along with the minor children, or do not show any245interest to accompany the children, the respondent shall deposita sum of Rs. 15 lakhs in the bank account of the appellant andproof of deposit shall be placed in the Registry of the High Courtwho shall thereupon call upon the Consulate General of the USat Hyderabad to take the custody of the minor children, alongwith their passports and other travel documents from theappellant and hand over the same to the respondent with acondition for taking the custody of the minor children for beingtaken to US and hand over to the jurisdictional Court in US untilfurther orders are passed in the pending proceedings by the USCourt. The appellant will be at liberty to utilize the moneydeposited by the respondent in connection with her visit to US, ifso desired, in future and the respondent shall not take anycoercive steps against her which in any manner may result inadverse consequences.[Para 57] [277-G-H; 278-A-D]"

In a situation like the one arising in the case,the High Court instead of going into the merits of the issue, shouldhave set aside the order dated 11.08.2000 passed by theSettlement Commission and remanded the case to the SettlementCommission for deciding the issue relating to waiver of interestpayable under Sections 234A , 234B, and 234C of the Act afreshkeeping in view the scope and the extent of powers of theSettlement Commissioner in relation to waiver of interest aslaid down in the Commissioner of Income Tax, Mumbai vs. AnjumM.H. Ghaswala & Ors., (2002) 1 SCC 633 and the other wasrendered on 21.10.2010 in Brij Lal & Ors. vs. Commissioner ofIncome Tax, Jalandhar, (2011) 1 SCC 1. [Para 22] [285-E]2. The High Court, however, committed a jurisdictionalerror when it observed that they (High Court) adopt the directionscontained in the order of the Settlement Commission dated11.10.2002 and then went on to make the said directions as apart of the impugned order in relation to waiver of interest. Thisapproach of the High Court is wholly without jurisdiction.[Para 23] [285-F-G]3. The High Court failed to see that the order dated11.10.2002 of the Settlement Commission was already set asideby the High Court itself in the first round vide order dated03.03.2014 passed in S.C.A. Nos. 15097 & 15101 of 2004 in thelight of law laid down by this Court in Brijlal wherein it is laiddown that the Settlement Commission has no power to pass ordersunder Section 154 of the Act. [Para 24] [285-G-H]4. Since the order dated 11.10.2002 of the SettlementCommission was already held bad in law on the ground that itwas passed under Section 154 of the Act, the same was neither inexistence for any purpose and nor it could be relied upon by theHigh Court much less for making it a part of their order for issuinga writ. [Para 25] [286-A-B]5. Therefore, the impugned order and the order dated11.08.2000 passed by Settlement Commission are set aside tothe extent it decided the issue in relation to waiver of interest281and remand the case to the Settlement Commission to decidethe issue relating to waiver of interest payable by the assessee(appellants herein) afresh keeping in view the law laid down bythis Court in Ghaswala and Brijlal after affording an opportunityto the parties concerned.

Theconcern as to what would be the situation if the employees werefinally allocated to the newly carved State of Andhra Pradesh andthe employees by that time had attained the age of 58 years, was289dealt with in newly inserted Section 3A in Andhra Pradesh StateReorganization Act, 2014. The principle was to re-induct them inthe services under the State of Andhra Pradesh without any breakin service. Further, if the employee had not attained the age of60 years, he would be re-inducted; and in case he had attainedthe age of 60 years, what would in such cases be conferred uponthe employees was notional advantage for the purpose ofcalculation of his pensionary benefits as if he had rendered servicein the State of Andhra Pradesh. [Para 11] [309-A-C]1.2 After the policy decision was taken on 05.08.2015 toraise the age of superannuation from 58 years to 60 years inrespect of employees of Society, that decision was kept inabeyance by Resolution dated 18.06.2016. This Resolution statedthat the Government had taken stock of all the developmentsand had decided that the issue regarding enhancement of age ofsuperannuation in respect of employees of the entities andinstitutions listed in IX and X Schedule of 2014 Act would betaken only after the issue of division of assets and liabilities ofthe concerned institutions between the two States was settledand the allotment of employees was finalized. This was followedby GO dated 28.06.2016 which dealt with issues like how afterre-induction of the employees pursuant to enhancement of ageof superannuation, the period that the employees were out ofemployment, was to be dealt with. Such period was referred toas the interregnum period or gap period, and was then dealt withunder various heads. These developments are indicative that itwas always in contemplation that if an employee hadsuperannuated on attaining the age of 58 years and was thereafterre-inducted in service with superannuation age being 60 years,he would not be entitled to any salary or normal emoluments forwhat was referred to as the interregnum period or gap period,but would be entitled to certain notional benefits stipulatedtherein. [Para 12] [309-D-G]1.3 GO dated 08.08.2017 modified the earlier decision dated27.06.2017 to the extent it had made such decisions prospectiveand now gave retrospective effect from 02.06.2014. It thusundoubtedly relaxed conditions as regards the requirement to K. ANANDA RAO v. SRI S.S. RAWAT, IAS AND ORS.290 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.have the rules and regulations amended after due approval bythe Government. It further stated that if an employee was retiredon attaining age of 58 years, he/she shall be reinstated andcontinued upto 60 years. However, this GO dated 08.08.2017did not in any way depart from or dilute the principles as to whatwould be the situation in case of interregnum period or gap periodas was specifically referred to and dealt with in memo dated28.06.2016. The situation becomes quite clear by furtherinstructions issued on 11.06.2018 which again referred to gapperiod. [Para 13] [310-B-D]1.4 Benefit of enhancement of the age of superannuationfrom 58 years to 60 years came to be conferred under policydocuments and finally by the GO dated 08.08.2017. Thus, thesource was in those policy documents and naturally the extent ofbenefits was also spelt out in those instruments issued by theGovernment. The Circular dated 28.06.2016 which was more orless adopted in proceedings dated 11.06.2018 must be taken tobe the governing criteria in respect of such employees. Unlessand until that governing criteria was departed from specifically,mere expression \u201cconsequential benefits\u201d would not entitle theconcerned employees anything greater than what wascontemplated in the policy documents issued by the StateGovernment. Therefore, no violation of the orders passed bySupreme Court is found. Every employee, who is similarly situatedwould be entitled to the benefits conferred by policy documentsreferred to above but not for salary and other emoluments forthe period they had not actually worked.

Supreme Court of India through Secretary General andOrs. (2017) 9 SCC 766 \u2013 Held: Second review petition is barred byOr.XLVII, r.5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2013 \u2013 Even otherwise, itis settled law that an Art.32 petition does not lie against the judgmentof the Supreme Court \u2013 Supreme Court Rules, 2013 - Or.XLVII, r.5.Dismissing the Writ Petition, the CourtHELD: 1. When contempt is committed in the face of theCourt, judges\u2019 hands are not tied behind their backs. The majestyof this Court as well as the administration of justice both demandthat contemptuous behavior of this kind be dealt with sternly. Anearly judgment of this Court in Sukhdev Singh Sodhi v. ChiefJustice S. Teja Singh, proceeded cautiously, but made it clear thatwhere a judge is personally attacked, it would be proper for thejudge to deal with the matter himself, in cases of contempt in theface of the Court. [Para 9] [334-E-F] 313[2019] 5 S.C.R. 313314 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.2. In Leila David (2) v. State of Maharashtra, two learnedJudges differed on whether contempt in the face of the Court canbe dealt with summarily, without any need of issuing notice to thecontemnors, and whether punishment can be inflicted upon themthere and then. Pasayat, J. held that this is, indeed, the duty ofthe Court. Ganguly, J. differed. A three-Judge Bench of thisCourt, in Leila David (6) v. State of Maharashtra, settled the law,making it clear that Pasayat, J.\u2019s view was the correct view inlaw. [Para 10] [335-D-E]3. Conduct of this kind deserves punishment which issevere. Though this Court could have punished the advocate bythis order itself, in the interest of justice, notice issued to advocatein question as to the punishment to be imposed upon him forcommitting contempt in the face of the Court. [Para 13][339-B-C]4. Insofar as the Writ Petition is concerned, the WritPetition, in essence, seeks a second review of the judgmentreported in Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India throughSecretary General and Ors. Even otherwise, it is settled law thatan Article 32 petition does not lie against the judgment of thisCourt. Further, Section 16(2) of the Advocates Act, 1961 is aprovision which cannot be said to be unconstitutional and thedesignation of Senior Advocate cannot be as a matter of bountyor as a matter of right.

The question involved in these appeals is theimplementation of the amendment to Rule 5(g) of Tamil NaduRevenue Subordinate Service Rules (TNRSS) and Annexure-III,item(ii) coupled with the judgment of the Supreme Court in M.Rathinaswami v. State of T.N. in and by which the Supreme Courtupheld the amendment to the rule qua Promotee non-graduateAssistants and read down the rule insofar as the Promoteegraduate Assistants. [Para 10] [351-C-D] A. RAJAGOPALAN v. THE DISTRICT COLLECTOR,THIRUCHIRAPALLI DISTRICT342 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.2. The State of Tamil Nadu issued G.O. No.884 wherebydirections were issued to amend Rule 5(g) and Annexure-III,item(ii) of TNRSS Rules retrospectively i.e. with effect from04.12.1978. Accordingly, G.O. No.133 dated 07.02.1995 wasissued providing amendment to the statutory Rules. The validityof the amendment to Rule 5(g) and Annexure-III item (ii) to theTNRSS Rules in G.O. Nos. 884 and 133 dated 12.08.1992 and07.02.1995 has been upheld by the Supreme Court inRathinaswami. While upholding the amendment to the Rule, theSupreme Court read down into the Rule to the extent that it givespreference to the Direct Recruit Assistants over the PromoteeAssistants who are graduates. The Supreme Court held that theamended rule giving preference to the Direct recruit Assistantswould be applicable only to the Promotee non-graduate Assistantsand Rule would be inapplicable to the Promotee Assistants whoare graduates. [Para 11] [351-D-G]3. The Division Bench of the High Court erred in directingthe State to treat the Promotee non-graduate Assistants,Promotee graduate Assistants and Direct recruit Assistants asone category and draw revised seniority list for the purpose ofpromotion to the post of Deputy Tahsildar. The Division Benchfailed to notice that the amendment to Rule 5(g) of TNRSS Rulesby G.O. No.133 dated 07.02.1995 has been upheld by the SupremeCourt and has attained finality. The direction of the DivisionBench to treat all three categories viz. Promotee non-graduateAssistants, Promotee graduate Assistants and Direct recruitAssistants as one group for the promotion to the post of DeputyTahsildar virtually amounts to reversing the judgment of theSupreme Court. The direction of the Division Bench in theimpugned judgment is wholly misconceived. [Para 15] [353-C-E]4. The classification of the \u201cPromotee graduate Assistants\u201don par with Direct recruit Assistants is only by virtue of the orderof the Supreme Court in Rathinaswami dated 08.04.2009. Asrightly pointed out by the appellants and the State, theimplementation of the order with effect from 04.12.1978 wouldcreate unprecedented confusion and upset the settled positionof Direct recruit Assistants who had been promoted from 1995till 2009 by virtue of the amended Rule conferring preferential343treatment on the Direct recruit Assistants. If such a course ofaction is permitted, it would seriously prejudice the rights of thoseof the Direct recruit Assistants who have been promoted from1995. [Para 17] [354-D-G]5. In the result, the impugned judgment of the High Courtis set aside and these appeals are allowed with the followingobservations and directions:-(i) Promotions of the Direct recruit Assistants effected between07.02.1995 and 08.04.2009 and their seniority in theirrespective positions as on date, shall not be disturbed;(ii) The benefit extended to the graduate promotee Assistantsby placing them on par with Direct recruit Assistants is tobe given effect to prospectively from the date of judgmentof this Court dated 08.04.2009 rendered in the case of M.Rathinaswami v. State of T.N. reported in (2009) 5 SCC 625;(iii) After 08.04.2009, the promotion to the post of DeputyTahsildar from its feeder category, i.e., Direct recruitAssistants and Promotee graduate Assistants, shall bestrictly in accordance with the judgment of this Courtreferred above, i.e., treating Promotee graduate Assistantson par with Direct recruit Assistants. Such promotion shallbe given effect to, without reference to any interim order(s)passed by the High Court;(iv) If any panels are prepared, and promotions are given, after08.04.2009 for promoting the Assistants to the post ofDeputy Tahsildars in Tamil Nadu Revenue SubordinateService contrary to the judgment of this Court dated08.04.2009, such panels and promotions have to be revisedso as to bring in conformity with the judgment of this Courtreferred above;(v) By virtue of the judgment of this Court dated 08.04.2009,referred above, Promotee graduate Assistants are placedon par with Direct recruit Assistants. So far as Promoteenon-graduate Assistants are concerned, the amended ruleholds the field, which gives preferential treatment to Directrecruit Assistants, over Promotee non-graduate Assistants; A. RAJAGOPALAN v. THE DISTRICT COLLECTOR,THIRUCHIRAPALLI DISTRICT344 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.(vi) Promotee non-graduate Assistants, who are impleaded asparty respondents in these appeals, are not entitled to anydirections in their favour, as much as, all these appeals arepreferred by Direct recruit Assistants;(vii) While implementing the above directions, if the seniorityand promotion, of the persons who are already retired ordead, is affected in any manner, payments made on accountof such seniority and promotion earlier granted to themduring the interregnum period, i.e., from 08.04.2009 tillthis date shall not be recovered.(viii) So far as Promotee non-graduate Assistants are concerned,it is open for them to pursue with the Government forappropriate amendment to the Rules, in which event it isopen to Government to consider such request on its ownmerits.

[Para 6.1] [366-E-F]2. At the outset, it is required to be noted that theproceedings before the inventory court as well as the High Courtwere under the provisions of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012/Portuguese Civil Code, which shall be continued on enactmentof the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012, as if those proceedingswere/are initiated under the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012 (inview of Section 460 of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012). It isrequired to be noted that the proceedings before the inventorycourt and the High Court were not at all with respect to GoaDaman & Diu Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act,1968. The proceedings were not between the landlord and thetenant. The provisions of Goa Rent Act shall be applicable withrespect to dispute between the landlord and the tenant. As perthe preamble of the Goa Rent Act, it has been enacted for controlof rents and evictions. At the cost of repetition, it is observedthat the dispute was neither under the provisions of the Goa RentAct nor between the landlord and the tenant and therefore both,the inventory court as well as the High Court have erred inconsidering the provisions of the Goa Rent Act, more particularlySection 2(o) of the Goa Rent Act. The only question which wasbefore the inventory court and the High Court was in respect ofthe rights of succession of a married daughter in the \u201cleasepremises\u201d under the provisions of the Portuguese Civil Codeand subsequently under the provisions of the InventoryProceeding Act, 2012. Therefore, what is required to beconsidered is whether under the provisions of the PortugueseCivil Code and on enactment of Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012,whether the married daughter would have a right of successionin the \u201clease premises\u201d or not? [Para 9] [368-H; 369-A-E]3. Considering the relevant provisions of the InventoryProceeding Act, 2012, first of all, it is required to be noted that359so far as rights of successor, i.e., heirs and legatees, as providedunder Section 5 of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012, as such,there is no classification between the daughter married orunmarried and son. It cannot be disputed that a daughter, maybe a daughter married or unmarried, would have a right ofsuccession in the properties of the parents including the lease.Section 399 of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012 provides forlist of assets which can be thrown to succession and it includesmovable and immovable assets including mortgages, easements,leases and other encumbrances. Even, as admitted by theadvocate appearing on behalf of the respondents, so stated inthe additional written submissions, it is not disputed to theproposition, whether Portuguese Civil Code, 1867 makes nodistinction as to the gender of the child or as to the order of birthor as to the status of being single or married to discriminate inmatters relating to succession. It is also admitted that this legalposition has not been changed pursuant to the enactment andenforcement of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012, brought intoforce with effect from 19.09.2016. Even otherwise, as per Section68 of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012, all the children andtheir descendants succeed to their respective parents and otherascendants, without distinction of sex or age. Thus, under theprovisions of the erstwhile Portuguese Civil Code, 1867 and/orunder the provisions of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012, thereis no further classification between a daughter married orunmarried and son. Therefore, considering the scheme and theprovisions of the erstwhile Portuguese Civil Code and as per theprovisions of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012, which has comeinto effect with effect from 19.09.2016, even the married daughterwould have a right of succession in the \u201clease premises\u201d. Asobserved hereinabove, Section 399 of the Inventory ProceedingAct, 2012 provides for list of assets which includes movablesand immovables assets including mortgages, easements, leasesand other encumbrances. [Para 10] [369-E-H; 370-A-D]4. Insofar as the submission on behalf of the respondentsthat in view of the subsequent development of the inventory courtpronouncing the final order and has drawn the final chart ofpartition in Regular Inventory Proceeding No. 11/2013/C, which UMA MAHESH BANDEKAR v. VIVEK SADANAND MARATHE .360 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.does not include the \u201clease premises\u201d and the appellants havingsigned and accepted the same, the present proceedings havebecome infructuous is concerned, the aforesaid has no substanceand the same is required to be rejected outright. It is requiredto be noted that the final order has been pronounced by theinventory court during the pendency of the present proceedings,excluding the \u201clease premises\u201d in the list of assets in theinventory proceedings which are under challenge. As the leasepremises was not included in the list of assets in the inventoryproceedings, naturally, the same would not be in the final chart ofpartition, and therefore, whatever order is passed by the inventorycourt, the appellants would have to sign and accept the same.However, as the present proceedings were pending and duringthe pendency of the present proceedings, the inventory courthas pronounced the final order and has drawn the final chart ofpartition, it cannot be said that the challenge to the exclusion ofthe \u201clease premises\u201d from the list of assets in the inventoryproceedings has become infructuous. As the present proceedingswere pending, the right of the appellants to challenge the exclusionof the \u201clease premises\u201d from the list of assets in the inventoryproceedings would continue and once it is held that appellantno.1 being a married daughter would have a right of successionin the \u201clease premises\u201d, and the same was wrongly excludedfrom the list of assets in the inventory proceedings, despite thefinal order being passed in the inventory proceedings and thefinal chart being drawn, the same can be amended with the aid ofSection 446 of the Inventory Proceeding Act, 2012.

Banumathi, J.:1.1 Tiruchanur village in Tirupati Rural Mandal, ChittoorDistrict is a minor Inam village and therefore, it attracts theprovisions of the Andhra Pradesh Inams (Abolition & Conversioninto Ryotwari) Act, 1956 (Inams Abolition Act). The entire landmeasuring acres 113.67 \u00bd comprised in Survey No.234 ofTiruchanur village, Tirupati Rural Mandal is classified as\u201cPeddacheruvu Poramboke\u201d (Tank Poramboke). All thecommunal government poramboke lands falls under Section 2-Aof the Inams Abolition Act. These lands are not available forgrant of ryotwari patta to any individual under the Act. Since thevillage is an Inam village, the then Inams Deputy Tahsildar,Collector\u2019s Office, Chittoor has declared entire land measuringacres 113.67 \u00bd as \u201cTank Poramboke\u201d and brought under Section2-A of Inams Abolition Act and the same was published in theDistrict Gazette No.9 dated 03.09.1984 at Page No.20. The InamsDeputy Tahsildar, Chittoor bonafidely ignoring the above fact,has by mistake, mentioned the Survey No.234 acres 54-00 as\u201cInam Dry\u201d at Page No.19 of the District Gazette, Chittoor No.9dated 03.09.1984 which is stated to be invalid. [Para 8] [380-D-G]1.2 The District Collector rightly held that the entire landin Survey No.234 of Tiruchanur village that is 113.67\u00bd wasSARVEPALLI RAMAIAH (D) AS PER LRS. v. DISTT.COLLECTOR CHITTOOR DISTRICT374 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.classified as \u201cPeddacheruvu Tank\u201d under Section 2-A of the InamsAbolition Act published in the official District Gazette No.9 dated03.09.1984. The District Collector has also pointed out that arecent order was passed by the Inams Deputy Tahsildar in IDTRef. No.1/83 dated 11.05.1993 declaring the total extent in SurveyNo.234 as Tank in pursuance of the order of the High Court dated13.04.1992 in WA Nos.941/88 and 1070/88 which has thus attainedfinality so far as classification of land. As rightly held by the DistrictCollector, when the entire extent of land in Survey No.234 wasclassified as Tank, no extent is available for grant of ryotwaripatta under the provisions of Inams Abolition Act and the questionof implementation of ryotwari patta does not arise. The learnedSingle Judge and the Division Bench rightly held that the land isclassified as \u201cPeddacheruvu Tank\u201d vested with the governmentand there is no question of issuance of ryotwari patta in view ofthe bar contained in Section 2-A of the Inams Abolition Act.[Para 11] [381-F-H; 382-A-B]1.3 Even though, in his order the District Collector referredto the Gazette Notification dated 03.09.1984, the appellants didnot challenge the said Gazette Notification. The Division Benchin its order elaborately also referred to the conduct of theappellants as to how they withheld the crucial part of the GazetteNotification viz. Page No.20 which contains the classification ofthe land as \u201cPeddacheruvu- Tank Poramboke in Survey No.234.The High Court rightly declined to quash the order of the DistrictCollector. No infirmity is found in the impugned order warrantinginterference.[Para 13] [382-G-H; 383-A-B]Per Indira Banerjee, J. (Concurring):1.1 The Andhra Pradesh (Andhra area) Inams (Abolitionand Conversion into Ryotwari) Act 1956, was enacted to abolishInam lands and to convert certain Inam lands to ryotwari lands inthe Andhra area of the State of Andhra Pradesh. Inam lands hasbeen defined in Section 2(c) of the 1956 Act. Section 2A of the1956 Act was inserted by amendment, by Act 20 of 1975.[Paras 5-7] [383-G-H; 384-D]3751.2 Even though the 1956 Act received the assent of thePresident of India on 10th December, 1956, was published in theofficial gazette on 14th December, 1956, and came into force atonce, the appellants and/or their predecessors in interest didnot apply for ryotwari patta soon thereafter. It was only in or around1980 that \u2018SR\u2019, since deceased, applied for grant of ryotwari pattafor the two plots of land. By a notification in the Chittoor DistrictGazette dated Monday, September 3, 1984 entire Survey No.234at Tiruchanoor was notified as Peddacheruvu Poramboke (tank)pursuant to the order of the Inams Deputy Tehsildar under sub\u0002section (3) and the final decision of the Revenue Court undersub-section (4) of Section 3 of the 1956 Act. The appellants and/or their predecessor in interest late \u2018SR\u2019 did not challenge thenotification. It appears that some others challenged thenotification in the Andhra Pradesh High Court, but the High Courtdid not set it aside. [Paras 9, 12 and 13] [385-B-C, E-F]1.3 The Single Bench rightly refused to entertain the writpetition as the Collector had questioned the genuineness of thepurported ryotwari pattas on the ground that there were no entrieswith regard to the pattas in the relevant register. The grant ofSaswatha Patta and execution of the takeed by the Mahanth ofthe Mutt in 1940 were also disputed. There were seriousallegations of illegal grant of pattas against the Inams DeputyTehsildar who had purportedly issued the two ryotwari pattas.Moreover, the pattas had purportedly been issued without anynotice of enquiry in the prescribed form, as required under Section7 of the 1956 Act read with the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area)Inam (Abolition and Conversion into Ryotwari) Rules 1957 framedunder Section 17 of the 1956 Act. Moreover, the entire SurveyNo.234 had been declared Tank poramboke and brought underSection 2A and, therefore, inalienable. Administrative decisionsare subject to judicial review under Article 226 of the Constitution,only on grounds of perversity, patent illegality, irrationality, wantof power to take the decision and procedural irregularity. Excepton these grounds administrative decisions are not interfered with,in exercise of the extra ordinary power of judicial review. In thiscase, the impugned decision, taken pursuant to orders of Court,was based on some materials. It cannot be said to be perverse,SARVEPALLI RAMAIAH (D) AS PER LRS. v. DISTT.COLLECTOR CHITTOOR DISTRICT376 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.to warrant interference in exercise of the High Court\u2019s extraordinary power of judicial review. A decision is vitiated byirrationality if the decision is so outrageous, that it is in defianceof all logic; when no person acting reasonably could possibly havetaken the decision, having regard to the materials on record.The decision in this case is not irrational.[Paras 22-24][387-F-H; 388-A-D]1.4 A decision may sometimes be set aside and quashedunder Article 226 on the ground of illegality. This is when thereis an apparent error of law on the face of the decision, which goesto the root of the decision and/or in other words an apparenterror, but for which the decision would have been otherwise.Judicial review under Article 226 is directed, not against thedecision, but the decision making process. Of course, a patentillegality and/or error apparent on the face of the decision, whichgoes to the root of the decision, may vitiate the decision makingprocess. In this case there is no such patent illegality or apparenterror. In exercise of power under Article 226, the Court doesnot sit in appeal over the decision impugned, nor does itadjudicate hotly disputed questions of fact. The decision of theCollector was based on materials and thus not liable to beinterfered with. The High Court very rightly did not interferewith the decision. It was not for the High Court, exercising itsextra ordinary power of judicial review, to reanalyse the evidenceon record and adjudicate the disputed question of whether theMahanth of the Mutt had at all granted Saswatha Patta to thepredecessors in interest of the appellants, whether the takeedwas duly executed by the Mahanth, whether the ryotwari pattaswere genuine or otherwise valid or not. Nor was it for the HighCourt to adjudicate the disputed fact of whether the land inquestion was in fact a water body or the dried bed of a waterbody. Cultivation is often carried out on the dried bed of waterbodies. That does not denude the land of its character as a waterbody.[Paras 25- 27] [388-D-H; 389-A]1.5 The High Court rightly based its decision on thedeclaration of the entire survey area as water body and held, ineffect, that the plots in question had vested in the governmentfree from all encumbrances under Section 2-A of the 1956 Act.377The respondents could not, therefore, be compelled to grantryotwari pattas in respect of the said plots. In this case reliefunder Article 226 was also liable to be refused on the grounds ofdelay, laches, acquiescence and/or omission of the appellants toassert their right, if any, within a reasonable time after thecommencement of the 1956 Act. The appellants and/or theirpredecessors were tardy and lethargic. The application for pattawas made over two decades after the commencement of the 1956Act, when the statute required that such an application be madesoon after its commencement. The Single Bench as also theDivision Bench of the High Court rightly held that it was wellsettled that poramboke (tank) cannot be alienated. No patta canbe granted in respect of tanks and water bodies including thosethat might have dried up or fallen into disuse. The appellantsand/or their predecessor in interest had not challenged thegazette notification of 3rd September, 1984 notifying the entireSurvey No.234 at Tiruchanoor as \u201cPeddacheruvu Poramboke\u201dthat is tank.

\u2013Andhra Bank officers\u2019 Service Regulations, 1982 \u2013 Appellants wereemployees of the respondent-Bank, viz., Andhra Bank, who resignedfrom service during the window period of 1991 and 1993 \u2013Thereafter, Pension Regulations, 1995 were introduced and it wasmade applicable for employees, who retired on or after 01.01.1986but before 01.11.1993 \u2013 Appellants sought benefit of these pensionRegulations \u2013 Writ petition by appellants \u2013 High Court rejected the393writ petition \u2013 On appeal, held: Rule 2(y) under pensionRegulations, 1995 had brought in \u2018voluntary retirement\u2019 in thedefinition of \u2018retirement\u2019, but had not considered it appropriate tobring in the concept of \u2018resignation\u2019 \u2013 Service jurisprudence,recognising the concept of \u2018resignation\u2019 and \u2018retirement\u2019 asdifferent, and in the same regulations these expressions being usedin different connotations, left no manner of doubt that the benefitcould not be extended, especially as resignation was one of thedisqualifications for seeking pensionary benefits, under theRegulations.Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018Voluntary Retirement\u2019 and \u2018Resignation\u2019 \u2013 Discussed.Answering the reference, the CourtHELD: C.A. No.14739 of 20151.The undisputed fact is that as on the date whenrespondent was revolving the thought in his mind of voluntaryretirement, there was no such provision in the Life InsuranceCorporation of India (Staff) Regulations, 1960 applicable. Thus,his repeated communications setting forth a thought process for\u2018voluntary retirement\u2019 had no legal backing on that date. It is inthese circumstances that no response was forthcoming to hisletters, when he talked about a concept which did not exist.Conscious of this aspect and wanting to leave the services of theappellant-LIC, the respondent took recourse to what waspermissible on that date, i.e., \u2018resignation\u2019. Section 3 of the StaffRegulations has a heading \u2018Termination\u2019. The other expressionused before the relevant Regulation 18 is \u2018Determination ofService\u2019. The Regulation itself uses the expression \u2018leave ordiscontinue\u2019 service. In whatever manner these expressions areunderstood, in legal and common parlance, they amount to, firsta unilateral act on the part of an employee, desirous of notcontinuing with her/his service with the employer and then,theacceptance of the same by the employer, subject to a noticeperiod, which, in the present facts, had been waived at therequest of the employee. Thus, on the relevant date he took aconscious decision to dis-engage himself from the services ofthe appellant, on the terms & conditions as prevalent on thatSENIOR DIVISIONAL MANAGER, L.I.C. OF INDIA LTD. v.SHREE LAL MEENA394 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.date. As to what happened five years hence, would have nobearing on any benefit, which can accrue to such employee as arespondent, except to the extent which is specifically madeapplicable to him. [Para 17] [403-D-H]2. It is trite to say that statutory provisions must be giventheir clear meaning unless there is ambiguity in the wordings.There is no ambiguity in the Life Insurance Corporation of India(Employees) Pension Rules, 1995 in question as to require anyimport to be given that is different from its plain words. ThePension Rules have been brought into force from aretrospective date of 1.11.1993. Thus, they would logically applyto all employees in service on or after 1.11.1993. Therespondent was not such a person. There is only one furthertwist to the Pension Rules. Rule 3(1)(a) of the Pension Rulesrefers to applicability of these Pension Rules even to such of theemployees who \u201cretired\u201d on or after 1.1.1986 and before1.11.1993. Even for such of the employees, there is arequirement for an option to be exercised, in writing, that withina period of time of 120 days from the notified date they becomemember of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (Employees)Pension Fund, and refund within 60 days thereafter, the entireamount of LIC\u2019s contribution to the Provident Fund, includinginterest accrued thereon. This is so, as employees who retiredduring this period of time had availed of the contributoryprovident fund benefit under the then existing Staff Regulations,and would have to surrender the benefits under thoseRegulations to the extent they were contributed for by the LIC,for the new Pension Rules to be made applicable to them. Theexpression used in Rule 3(1)(a) is clear andunequivocal\u2013 \u2018retired\u2019. It has not used any alternativeexpression also, for determination of the relationship ofemployer-employee, like \u2018resignation\u2019. In the same Rules,expressions like \u2018resignation\u2019, \u2018dismissal\u2019, \u2018removal\u2019 have beenused, more specifically in Rule 23 of the Pension Rules. Whendifferent expressions are used in the same Rules, in differentcontexts then all of them cannot be given the same meaning.[Para 18] [404-A-F]3953. What is most material is that the employee in this casehad resigned. When the Pension Rules are applicable, and anemployee resigns, the consequences are forfeiture of service,under Rule 23 of the Pension Rules. Attempting to apply thePension Rules to the respondent would be a self-defeatingargument. As, suppose, the Pension Rules were applicable andthe employee like the respondent was in service and sought toresign, the entire past service would be forfeited, andconsequently, he would not qualify for pensionary benefits. Tohold otherwise would imply that an employee resigning duringthe currency of the Rules would be deprived of pensionarybenefits, while an employee who resigns when these Rules werenot even in existence, would be given the benefit of these Rules.[Para 19] [405-A-C]4. There are some observations on the principles of publicsectors being model employers and provisions of pension beingbeneficial legislations. When the Legislature, in its wisdom,brings forth certain beneficial provisions in the form of PensionRegulations from a particular date and on particular terms andconditions, aspects which are excluded cannot be included in itby implication. The provisions will have to be read as they readunless there is some confusion or they are capable of anotherinterpretation. It is also to be noted that while framing suchschemes, there is an important aspect of them being of a con\u0002tributory nature and their financial implications. Such financialimplications are both, for the contributors and for the State. Thus,it would be inadvisable to expand such beneficial schemesbeyond their contours to extend them to employees for whomthey were not meant for by the Legislature. [Para 25] [411-C-E]C.A. No.10904 of 20165. In the year 2011, this Court in Sheel Kumar Jain v. NewIndia Assurance Company Limited gave benefit of GeneralInsurance (Employees\u2019) Pension Scheme, 1995 to certainemployees. The judgment was delivered on 28.7.2011. Onceagain, almost after two years, the appellant made arepresentation dated 4.4.2013 seeking pension on the basis ofSENIOR DIVISIONAL MANAGER, L.I.C. OF INDIA LTD. v.SHREE LAL MEENA396 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.the 1995 Scheme, resting his case on the aforesaid judgment.There was no response to this representation, resulting in theappellant filing a writ petition before the Bombay High Court.The Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, in terms of theimpugned judgment dated 07.04.2016 rejected the same. Thereasoning of the Division Bench was that the case of theappellant was of resignation and not of voluntary retirement. Theappellant had tendered his resignation before 1.11.1993, whilethe conditions for availing of the benefit were: (i) the employeesmust have retired on or after 1.11.1993, and before the notifieddate; and (ii) the employee must have exercised the option tovoluntarily retire within120 days from the notified date, tobecome a member of the General Insurance Corporation(Employees\u2019)Pension Fund while refunding the amount ofProvident Fund contributed by the insurance company. Thesetwo aspects were stated to be absent in the case of the appellant,who had never opted for voluntary retirement within therequisite period nor refunded the amount, which werepre-requisites for availing the benefit of the new pension scheme.The opinion of the Division Bench was also based on a relevantfact, that the condition in terms of clause 4(4A) requiredcompletion of 55 years of age, while the appellant was not of 55years of age on the date of his resignation or its acceptance.[Paras 28, 29] [412-C-H; 413-A]6. Mere categorisation by the appellant himself of hisresignation as \u201cpremature retirement\u201d is of no avail. Theprinciple of forfeiture of service, would be applicable here andthe appellant did not have the requisite age when he resignedeven were the General Insurance (Termination, Superannuationand Retirement of Officers and Development Staff) Scheme, 1976to be made applicable. [Para 35] [414-G-H]7. Also that the appellant remained silent for years togetherand that this Court,taking a particular view subsequently, in SheelKumar Jain, would not entitle stale claims to be raised on thisbehalf, like that of the appellant. In fact the appellant slept overthe matter for almost a little over two years even after thepronouncement of the judgment. [Para 36] [415-A-B]397Civil Appeal Nos. 3138-3141 of 2019 @ SLP(C) Nos.5716-5719of 20168. It is relevant to note that M.R. Prabhakar & Ors. dealtwith a similar scheme for employees of the Canara Bank, and theplea was that such of the employees who had resigned must beconstrued as voluntarily retired, thus, entitling them topensionary benefits. Suffice to say that, once again, the principlewas of differentiation between the concept of \u2018voluntaryretirement\u2019 and \u2018resignation\u2019. Regulation 2(y)as applicable tothe employees of Canara Bank, being pari materia to Rule 2(y)under the Pension Regulations of 1995,had brought in \u2018volun\u0002tary retirement\u2019 in the definition of \u2018retirement\u2019, but had notconsidered it appropriate to bring in the concept of \u2018resignation\u2019.Service jurisprudence, recognising the concept of \u2018resignation\u2019and \u2018retirement\u2019 as different, and in the same regulations theseexpressions being used in different connotations, left no mannerof doubt that the benefit could not be extended, especially asresignation was one of the disqualifications for seekingpensionary benefits,under the Regulations.

Such general restrictions areessentially to remind the Appellate Court that an accused ispresumed to be innocent unless proved guilty beyond reasonabledoubt and a judgment of acquittal further strengthens suchpresumption in favour of the accused. However, such restrictionsneed to be visualised in the context of the particular matter beforethe Appellate Court and the nature of inquiry therein. The samerule with same rigour cannot be applied in a matter relating tothe offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act,1881, particularly where a presumption is drawn that the holderhas received the cheque for the discharge, wholly or in part, ofany debt or liability. Of course, the accused is entitled to bring onrecord the relevant material to rebut such presumption and toshow that preponderance of probabilities are in favour of hisdefence but while examining if the accused has brought about aprobable defence so as to rebut the presumption, the AppellateCourt is certainly entitled to examine the evidence on record inorder to find if preponderance indeed leans in favour of theaccused. [Para 11.1] [432-B-F]1.2 The appellant could not deny his signature on thecheques in question that had been drawn in favour of thecomplainant on a bank account maintained by the accused for asum of Rs. 3 lakhs each. The said cheques were presented to the419Bank concerned within the period of their validity and werereturned unpaid for the reason of either the balance beinginsufficient or the account being closed. All the basic ingredientsof Section 138 as also of Sections 118 and 139 NI Act are apparenton the face of the record. The Trial Court had also consciouslytaken note of these facts and had drawn the requisite presumption.Therefore, it is required to be presumed that the cheques inquestion were drawn for consideration and the holder of thecheques i.e., the complainant received the same in discharge ofan existing debt. The onus, therefore, shifts on the appellant toestablish a probable defence so as to rebut such a presumption.On the aspects relating to preponderance of probabilities, theaccused has to bring on record such facts and such circumstanceswhich may lead the Court to conclude either that the considerationdid not exist or that its non-existence was so probable that aprudent man would, under the circumstances of the case, act uponthe plea that the consideration did not exist. Though there maynot be sufficient negative evidence which could be brought onrecord by the accused to discharge his burden, yet mere denialwould not fulfil the requirements of rebuttal as envisaged underSection 118 and 139 of the NI Act. [Paras 14, 16] [434-D-F;435-H; 436-A-B]1.3 In the case at hand, even after purportedly drawing thepresumption under Section 139 of the NI Act, the Trial Courtproceeded to question the want of evidence on the part of thecomplainant as regards the source of funds for advancing loan tothe accused and want of examination of relevant witnesses whoallegedly extended him money for advancing it to the accused.This approach of the Trial Court had been at variance with theprinciples of presumption in law. After such presumption, the onusshifted to the accused and unless the accused had dischargedthe onus by bringing on record such facts and circumstances asto show the preponderance of probabilities tilting in his favour,any doubt on the complainant\u2019s case could not have been raisedfor want of evidence regarding the source of funds for advancingloan to the appellant. The aspect relevant for consideration hadbeen as to whether the appellant has brought on record suchfacts/material/circumstances which could be of a reasonablyprobable defence. In order to discharge his burden, the accused ROHITBHAI JIVANLAL PATEL v. STATE OF GUJARAT420 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.put forward the defence that in fact, he had had the monetarytransaction with the said Shri \u2018J\u2019 and not with the complainant.Apart from making certain suggestions in the cross-examination,the appellant has not adduced any documentary evidence to satisfyeven primarily that there had been some monetary transaction ofhimself with Shri \u2018J\u2019. Shri \u2018J\u2019 was cross-examined on variousaspects as regards the particulars in the writing on the stamppaper and the date and time of the transactions. The statementof \u2018J\u2019 does not make out any case in favour of the appellant. [Paras17, 18, 18.3 & 18.4] [437-D-H; 438-G; 439-G-H]1.4 The appellant could not deny his signatures on the saidwriting but attempted to suggest that his signatures wereavailable on the blank stamp paper with Shri \u2018J\u2019. This suggestionis too remote and too uncertain to be accepted. No cogent reasonis available for the appellant signing a blank stamp paper. It isalso indisputable that the cheques as mentioned therein with allthe relevant particulars like cheque numbers, name of Bank andaccount number are of the same cheques which form the subjectmatter of these complaint cases. The said document bears thedate 21.03.2007 and the cheques were post-dated, starting from01.04.2008 and ending at 01.12.2008. No reason to discard thiswriting from consideration. [Para 18.6] [440-E-F]1.5 The present one was clearly a case where the decisionof the Trial Court suffered from perversity and fundamental errorof approach; and the High Court was justified in reversing thejudgment of the Trial Court. The observations of the Trial Courtthat there was no documentary evidence to show the source offunds with the respondent to advance the loan, or that therespondent did not record the transaction in the form of receiptof even kachcha notes, or that there were inconsistencies in thestatement of the complainant and his witness, or that the witnessof the complaint was more in know of facts etc. would have beenrelevant if the matter was to be examined with reference to theonus on the complaint to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt.These considerations and observations do not stand in conformitywith the presumption existing in favour of the complainant byvirtue of Sections 118 and 139 of the NI Act. The result of such421presumption is that existence of a legally enforceable debt is tobe presumed in favour of the complainant. When such apresumption is drawn, the factors relating to the want ofdocumentary evidence in the form of receipts or accounts or wantof evidence as regards source of funds were not of relevantconsideration while examining if the accused has been able torebut the presumption or not. The other observations as regardsany variance in the statement of complainant and witness; or wantof knowledge about dates and other particulars of the cheques;or washing away of the earlier cheques in the rains though theoffice of the complainant being on the 8th floor had also been ofirrelevant factors for consideration of a probable defence of theappellant. Similarly, the factor that the complainant alleged theloan amount to be Rs. 22,50,000/- and seven cheques being ofRs. 3,00,000/- each leading to a deficit of Rs. 1,50,000/-, is noteven worth consideration for the purpose of the determination ofreal questions involved in the matter. Significantly, the specificamount of loan (to the tune of Rs. 22,50,000/-) was distinctly statedby the appellant in the aforesaid acknowledgment dated21.03.2017. The Trial Court appears to have proceeded on amisplaced assumption that by mere denial or mere creation ofdoubt, the appellant had successfully rebutted the presumptionas envisaged by Section 139 of the NI Act. In the scheme of theNI Act, mere creation of doubt is not sufficient. The High Courthas conscientiously and carefully taken into consideration theviews of the Trial Court and after examining the evidence onrecord as a whole, found that the findings of the Trial Court arevitiated by perversity. Hence, interference by the High Courtwas inevitable; rather had to be made for just and proper decisionof the matter. [Paras 19-21] [441-D-H; 442-A-D, F]1.6 The findings of the High Court convicting the appellantfor offence under Section 138 of the NI Act are confirmed. In thetotality of the circumstances of this case and the nature of offencewhich is regulatory in nature, the punishment as regards monetaryterms calls for no interference but then, the sentence ofimprisonment deserve to be modified. The common judgmentand order dated 08.01.2018 in R/Criminal Appeal No. 1187/2017 ROHITBHAI JIVANLAL PATEL v. STATE OF GUJARAT422 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.connected with R/Criminal Appeal Nos. 1191/2017 to 1196/2017by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad is maintained asregards conviction of the appellant for the offence under Section138 of the NI Act, 1881 for dishonour of 7 cheques in the sum ofRs. 3 lakhs each, as drawn by him in favour of the complainant\u0002respondent No. 2; however, the sentence is modified in themanner that in each of these 7 cases, the appellant shall pay fineto the extent of double the amount of each cheque (i.e., a sum ofRs. 6 lakhs in each case) within 2 months from today with thestipulation that in case of default in payment of fine, the appellantshall undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year. Onrecovery of the amount of fine, the complainant-respondent No.2 shall be compensated to the tune of Rs. 5.5 lakhs in each case.In the event of imprisonment for default in payment of fine, thesentences in all the 7 cases shall run concurrently.

Keeping in view the law laid down by this Courtin the case of Union of India v.

The HighCourt failed to see that it is not the function of the Courts toframe any Scheme but it is the sole prerogative of the Governmentto do it. [Paras 14, 15 and 16] [450-F-H]2. All that the High Court, in exercise of its extraordinarypower under Article 226 of the Constitution, can do is to directthe Government to consider for framing an appropriate Schemehaving regard to the facts and circumstances of any case whichthis Court did in the case of Union of India but not beyond it. Itis only in an exceptional case where the Court considers it properto issue appropriate mandatory directions it may do so but nototherwise. [Para 17] [451-A-B]3. It is not in dispute that the appellant-Union of India hasnow framed a welfare scheme for all such casual workers. Thesalient features of the welfare scheme and the benefits which arebeing extended to all such casual workers are set out in Para 14(i) to (xii) of the petition. [Para 18] [451-B-C]"

The hospital is a branch of the respondent(Ramakrishna Mission) and is subject to its control. The activitiesundertaken by the Mission are voluntary, charitable and non-[2019] 5 S.C.R. 452 452453profit making in nature. These activities are not closely relatedto those performed by the State in its sovereign capacity nor dothey partake of the nature of a public duty. [Para 19] [461-C-F]2. The Governing Body of the Mission is constituted bymembers of the Board of Trustees of Ramakrishna Math and isvested with the power and authority to manage the organization.The properties and funds of the Mission and its managementvest in the Governing Body. Any person can become a memberof the Mission if elected by the Governing Body. Members onroll form the quorum of the annual general meetings. TheManaging Committee comprises of members appointed by theGoverning Body for managing the affairs of the Mission. Underthe Memorandum of Association and Rules and Regulations ofthe Mission, there is no governmental control in the functioning,administration and day to day management of the Mission. Theconditions of service of the employees of the hospital aregoverned by service rules which are framed by the Missionwithout the intervention of any governmental body. [Para 20][461-G-H; 462-A-B]3. Even if the body discharges a public function in a widersense, there is no public law element involved in theenforcement of a private contract of service. In running thehospital, Ramakrishna Mission does not discharge a publicfunction. Undoubtedly, the hospital is in receipt of some elementof grant. The grants which are received by the hospital coveronly a part of the expenditure. The terms of the grant do notindicate any form of governmental control in the management orday to day functioning of the hospital. The nature of the workwhich is rendered by Ramakrishna Mission, in general,including in relation to its activities concerning the hospital inquestion is purely voluntary. [Para 30] [467-C-F]4. Before an organisation can be held to discharge a publicfunction, the function must be of a character that is closelyrelated to functions which are performed by the State in itssovereign capacity. There is nothing on record to indicate thatthe hospital performs functions which are akin to those solelyperformed by State authorities. Medical services are providedby private as well as State entities. The character of the RAMAKRISHNA MISSION v. KAGO KUNYA454 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.organisation as a public authority is dependent on thecircumstances of the case. In setting up the hospital, theMission cannot be construed as having assumed a publicfunction. The hospital has no monopoly status conferred ormandated by law. That it was the first in the State to provideservice of a particular dispensation does not make it an\u2018authority\u2019 within the meaning of Article 226. State Governmentsprovide concessional terms to a variety of organisations in orderto attract them to set up establishments within the territorialjurisdiction of the State. The State may encourage them as anadjunct of its social policy or the imperatives of economicdevelopment. The mere fact that land had been provided on aconcessional basis to the hospital would not by itself result in theconclusion that the hospital performs a public function. In thepresent case, in absence of State control in the management ofthe hospital the hospital does not come within the ambit of apublic authority. [Para 31] [467-F-H; 468-A-C]5. Regulation by a statute does not constitute the hospitalas a body which is constituted under the statute. Individuals andorganisations are subject to statutory requirements in a wholehost of activities. That by itself cannot be conclusive of whethersuch an individual or organisation discharges a public function.Thus, contracts of a purely private nature would not be subjectto writ jurisdiction merely by reason of the fact that they arestructured by statutory provisions. The only exception to thisprinciple arises in a situation where the contract of service isgoverned or regulated by a statutory provision.[Paras 32, 33] [468-E-F; 469-C-D]6. The Clinical Establishments (Registration andRegulation) Act 2010 was enacted to provide for the regulationand registration of clinical establishments with a view to prescribeminimum standards of facilities and services. The Act, inter alia,stipulates conditions to be satisfied by clinical establishmentsfor registration. However, the Act does not govern contracts ofservice entered into by the Hospital with respect to itsemployees. These fall within the ambit of purely private contracts,against which writ jurisdiction cannot lie. The sanctity of thisdistinction must be preserved. [Paras 32, 34] [468-B; 469-E-F]4557. The Division Bench of the High Court was not justifiedin coming to the conclusion that the appellants are amenable tothe writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution as anauthority within the meaning of the Article. Neither theRamakrishna Mission, nor the hospital would constitute anauthority within the meaning of Article 226 of the Constitution.[Paras 35, 36] [469-F-H]"

The Railway Boardformulated policy for offering employment to persons displacedby the acquisition of land for railway projects. Employment noticefor recruitment of Gangmen in Group \u2018D\u2019 posts in the EngineeringDepartment of the Sambalpur Division. Land oustess of theSambalpur-Talcher Rail Link Project allowed to apply, if otherwiseeligible. O.As were filed before the Central AdministrativeTribunal, Cuttack Bench by the displaced persons. The Tribunalfound fault with the Railway for initiating selection process forfilling up 511 vacancies in Group \u2018D\u2019 posts, holding that recourseto direct recruitment was not justified without accommodatingall the land oustees and observed that it would be enough if theyare found suitable for the post by recruitment committee. Inchallenge by the Union of India, the High Court affirmed the saiddecision. Hence, the present appeals.Allowing the appeals, the CourtHELD: 1.1 The policy of the Railway Board envisaged thatappointments are to be made only on the fulfillment of theconditions specified in the instructions (Clause 1 of the letterdated 8 December 1989). The instructions stipulated that thedispensation to give preferential treatment to land oustees inemployment is to be limited to recruitments made from outsidein direct recruitment categories, subject to the terms andconditions stipulated. The instructions also stipulated thatcandidates must fulfill the qualifications for the post and shouldbe found suitable by the appropriate recruitment committees. Inview of the terms and conditions, stipulated in the relevant473instructions and circulars, it is not possible to accede to the viewof the Tribunal that the land oustees are not required to undergothe process of selection. Though the instructions provided forthe grant of preferential treatment, this was subject to thefulfillment of all other terms and conditions, stipulated in theinstructions. While laying down a policy for preferential treatment,the Union Government was entitled to stipulate the conditionssubject to which a claim for appointment in Group \u2018C\u2019 and Group\u2018D\u2019 posts for the land oustees could be considered. The Tribunalexceeded the limits of its adjudicatory authority by virtuallysubstituting its own directions for the policy which was formulatedby the Union Government. Such an exercise, by its very nature,is impermissible. The terms on which a policy of offeringemployment to the land oustees should be framed is a matter tobe decided by the Ministry of Railways. Once this exercise hasbeen carried out, it was neither appropriate nor proper for theTribunal to trench upon that area. Out of 9,036 families whichwere covered by the Sambalpur-Talcher Rail Link Project, 2,805persons had applied for employment. 652 persons wereshortlisted, out of whom 553 persons appeared for the writtentest. 110 persons cleared the written test, out of whom76 were offered employment. 66 persons joined service.[Paras 18-20] [480-G-H; 481-A-E]1.2 It would be extremely technical to reject the applicationswithout sufficient opportunity to the land oustees to comply withthe terms and conditions, including the submission of proof ofbeing land oustees. As a matter of fact, the policy which hasbeen formulated by the Ministry of Railways contemplated thatas land acquisition is done through the civil authorities, the villagesarpanch or tehsildar should be associated with the verificationof the claim of the oustees. Placing the entire burden on the landoustees would result in a deprivation of the benefit of the policy.Having laid down a salutary policy, it is necessary that the Ministryof Railways must coordinate its activities with the localadministration so as to ensure due verification of the claims madeby the applicants. Notwithstanding the earlier rejection of theclaims of 2,153 land oustees, steps should be taken for re- UNION OF INDIA & ORS. v. SHANKAR PRASAD DEEP474 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.verification of all the claims of persons who were rejected in thepast. Sufficient opportunity shall be granted to them to submitapplications afresh along with requisite certificates. Freshapplications be called within a period of three months. Anadvertisement shall be issued for that purpose with due publicityin the area. The applications submitted in pursuance to theadvertisement by land oustees of the Sambalpur-Talcher LinkRail Project shall be reconsidered as against the 82 vacanciesand in addition thereto, against any other vacancies that maypresently exist in respect of the Sambalpur Division and thosewhich may arise in the next two years. The selection processshall be completed within the next six months.[Paras 22, 23] [482-B-G]1.3 Applicants would be entitled to an age relaxation of 15years. The applications of other land oustees apart from 2,153land oustees reflected in the tabulated chart shall also be dulyconsidered by the Divisional Manager. However, applicants wouldbe required to fulfill all other prescriptions, including educationalqualifications, appearing at the written test, minimum agerequirements and medical fitness. The written test shall be heldexclusively for the applicants from among the land oustees. It isclarified that there shall be no displacement of the candidateswho were appointed in the process of direct recruitment. Thejudgments of the High Court and the Tribunal are set aside.[Paras 24, 25] [482-G-H; 483-A-B]"

CREATIONS486 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.its own WTPSG Policy. ECGC paid Rs. 6 lakhs to PNB asprovisional payment. First respondent submitted two claims ofRs.22.87 lakhs to ECGC against the overdue amounts fromSICOREP. ECGC rejected the claim of the first respondent.Complaint filed by the first respondent before the StateCommission, which was allowed. National Commission confirmedthe said order. Hence, the present appeal.Allowing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 The first respondent was unable to producethe relevant documents or to indicate that there was anacceptance of the documents, in terms as required under theapproval of the sales contract by ECGC. It was in this backgroundthat ECGC rejected the claim of the first respondent on 3 October2002. [Para 22, 23] [492-E-F]1.2 In terms of the exclusion contained in the insurancepolicy, the insurer was not to be held liable for any loss from anyact or default on the part of the collecting bank. Evidently, thecollecting bank, as its communication dated 22 November 2002indicates, handed over the original documents, but then soughtto justify its action by contending that the bank was in the housingsector and could not accept the shipment for payment. If this wasthe position, there was no reason or justification on the part ofthe collecting bank to hand over the original documents to aperson representing SICOREP without acceptance. There was,therefore, clearly a default on the part of the collecting bank.The State Commission and the National Commission held againstECGC inter alia on the ground that by honoring its commitmentto PNB under WTPSG Policy, ECGC had in turn admitted itsliability to the first respondent. There is a fallacy in this hypothesis.The guarantee which ECGC furnished to PNB, similar to those itfurnishes to other bankers, was to secure their exposure againstthe risks involved in the advances which the bank had made inrespect of export contracts to its constituent. This guaranteewhich ECGC issued to PNB would not conclude the issue as towhether the claim made by the first respondent under a distinctinsurance policy was sustainable. Consequently, the basis onwhich the State Commission and National Commission heldagainst the appellant is erroneous. [Paras 25-26] [493-A-E]4871.3 The order passed by the State Commission was dulyexecuted and in compliance, the amount due and payable hasbeen paid over by ECGC to the first respondent. There is noallegation that the first respondent was in any way connected withor colluded with SICOREP. From the record, it appears that thefirst respondent was itself a victim of SICOREP having retiredthe documents without making payment for the exportconsignments. No submission has been urged on behalf of ECGCto indicate the complicity of the first respondent. In the exerciseof our jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution, it isdirected that no recoveries should be made from the firstrespondent. [Para 27] [493-F-H]"

Admittedly, the cheques wereissued under and in pursuance of the agreement to sell.

Recourse to thejurisdiction of the High Court under Section 482 was a clear abuseof process. [Paras 13, 14] [502-G-H; 503-A-C]"

STATE OF TAMIL NADU538 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.by the Trial Court as well as by the High Court, and strengthenedthe evidence of PWs 1 and 2 regarding the identification of thebody \u2013 Though a DNA test would have helped the Courts immenselyin determining the reliability of the identification of the body of thedeceased, in the presence of other reliable evidence on record infavour of the prosecution version on this aspect, the contentionthat the non-conducting of a DNA test and the reliance on evidenceregarding identification through superimposition is improper isrejected \u2013 This is all the more true since no material was forthcomingto the effect that the parents of the deceased were alive during therelevant period, so as to conduct comparative DNA tests \u2013Superimposition test.Dismissing the appeals, the CourtHELD: 1. The argument for the appellants that the incidentof murder in the case in hand is merely a continuation of an earlieroffence relating to the abduction of PW1 and the deceased whichoccurred has no force. The crime of abduction commenced whenthe victims (PW1 and the deceased) were forced into captivityand was completed on the same day immediately after the victimswere released. In respect of the said incident, the first informationwas lodged by PW1. During the investigation of the said case,the accused brought the deceased, PW1 and her family membersto Tirunelveli. The crime in question was committed after twodays, whereby PW1 and her husband were taken away in a car,and on the direction of Accused No.1, Accused Nos. 2 to 4, 6 and7 forcibly took away the deceased by separating him from hiswife, committed his murder and threw away his body in the forestarea. The time and place of occurrence of the two incidents weredifferent. It is evident that unity of purpose and design betweenthe two offences was also absent. [Para 15] [550-F; 551-B-D, F]1.2 The facts and circumstances of the matter clearlyindicated that the offence of abduction committed by the appellantsand the offence of murder were two different and distinct offences,and therefore, there is no question of further investigation to bemade in the crime of abduction by the investigating agencyrelating to the offence of murder which was committed duringthe subsistence of the investigation relating to abduction. Further539investigation, as envisaged under Sub-section 8 of Section 173of the Cr.P.C, connotes investigation of the case in continuationof an earlier investigation with respect to which the chargesheethas already been filed. In case a fresh offence is committed duringthe course of the earlier investigation, which is distinct from theoffence being investigated, such fresh offence cannot beinvestigated as part of the pending case, and should instead beinvestigated afresh. The separate first information lodged in thiscase is just, legal and proper. [Paras 18, 20] [554-A-C; 556-A]Awadesh Kumar Jha v. State of Bihar (2016) 3 SCC 8 ;State of A.P. v. Cheemalapati Ganeswara Rao [1964] 3SCR 297 ; T.T. Antony v. State of Kerala (2001) 6 SCC181: [2001] 3 SCR 942; Rameshchandra NandlalParikh v. State of Gujarat (2006) 1 SCC 732; NirmalSingh Kahlon v.

State of Gujarat(2010) 12 SCC 254 : [2010] 10 SCR 651 \u2013 relied on.2.1 There was no direct evidence in the instant matter andthe whole case rests on circumstantial evidence. In matters restingon circumstantial evidence, the Judge while deciding shouldalways tread cautiously so as to not allow conjectures or suspicion,however strong, to take the place of proof. If the allegedcircumstances are conclusively proved before the Court byleading cogent and reliable evidence, the Court need not lookany further before affirming the guilt of the accused. PW-1 deposedin detail as to how Accused No.1 wanted to marry her and how heoften tried to lure her through undue favours. She meticulouslydeposed about the role of each of the appellants in the crime. Inthe cross-examination, she also explained the delay in lodgingthe first information by deposing that she could not file thecomplaint before 20.11.2001 though her husband was abductedon 26.10.2001 because she was under the constant surveillanceof Accused No. 1 and his henchmen and could only free herselfafter 06.11.2011. Also, in the first incident (being the incident ofabduction), her husband was spared by Accused No. 1, and on asubsequent occasion also, he was spared by Accused No. 2. Thus,she was hopeful that her husband would escape on this occasion PATTU RAJAN v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU540 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.as well. Though PW1 was cross-examined at length, the defencecould not discredit her evidence on material particulars. Minorvariations pointed out by the defence, as such neither affectedthe prosecution version nor PW1\u2019s evidence in its entirety.[Paras 22, 24] [556-D-F; 558-G-H; 559-A-D]2.2 PW1 deposed about the aspect of motive, the last seencircumstance as well as the identification of the personalbelongings of the deceased and his dead body. She was the witnesswho saw the deceased in the company of the accused for the lasttime before his death. The evidence of PW1 was fully supportedby the evidence of PW2, the mother of PW1. [Paras 25, 26]3. The testimony of PW7, the Village Administrative Officerworking in the office of the Tehsildar, is also relevant andsignificant. In his presence, Accused No.2 confessed to theInspector of Police, that if taken to Kodaikanal, he would showthe spot at Tiger-Chola where the dead body of PW\u2019s husbandwas thrown. Accordingly, Accused No.2 was taken to the saidplace and he pointed out the place of disposal of the body, andalso identified the dead body of the deceased from thephotographs available with the police. Nothing material worthconsidering in favour of the defence was extracted from the cross\u0002examination of PW7. [Para 27] [560-E-G; 561-A]4. There cannot be any dispute that a confession made bythe accused in police custody is an inadmissible confession. Theconfession herein cannot even be called an extra-judicialconfession because of the presence of the police. If a confessionis made by the accused before the police and a portion of theconfession leads to the recovery of any incriminating material,such portion alone is admissible under Section 27 of the IndianEvidence Act. Since only such portion of the confession relatingto the recovery of certain material objects was admitted inevidence and relied upon, such reliance was in accordance withlaw. [Para 27] [561-B-C]5. During the course of investigation, the records of thevarious hotels in which the accused had stayed along with thedeceased, PW1 and her family were collected. PW36, the541handwriting expert compared the handwritings in the hotelrecords with the handwritings of the accused and opined theformer to belong to Accused Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 8. This supportedthe conclusion that the accused in fact took PW1 and her familymembers to various places as deposed by them. [Para 30][562-H; 563-A-B]6. DNA evidence is also in the nature of opinion evidenceas envisaged in Section 45 of the Evidence Act. Undoubtedly, anexpert giving evidence before the Court plays a crucial role,especially since the entire purpose and object of opinion evidenceis to aid the Court in forming its opinion on questions concerningforeign law, science, art, etc., on which the Court might not havethe technical expertise to form an opinion on its own. Undoubtedly,it is the duty of an expert witness to assist the Court effectivelyby furnishing it with the relevant report based on his expertisealong with his reasons, so that the Court may form its independentjudgment by assessing such materials and reasons furnished bythe expert for coming to an appropriate conclusion. However,the opinion evidence is advisory in nature, and the Court is notbound by the evidence of the experts. It cannot be said thatabsence of DNA evidence would lead to an adverse inferenceagainst a party, especially in the presence of other cogent andreliable evidence on record in favour of such party.

The superimposition test was conducted in the instantcase for identifying the deceased. There cannot be any disputethat evidence on superimposition is also based on experts\u2019 PATTU RAJAN v. STATE OF TAMIL NADU542 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.opinion. The High Court was justified in observing that asuperimposition test cannot be taken as a conclusive one for theidentification of a dead body, because by itself it may notconclusively establish identification. However, the High Courtrightly accepted the expert testimony on this aspect since in theinstant case, the superimposition test was merely one piece ofevidence relied upon by the prosecution to corroborate theevidence of PWs 1 and 2 in order to strengthen its case.Moreover, it is evident from the testimony of PW34, whoconducted the superimposition test, that the test was conductedby using three different methods, i.e. video superimposition, visualobservation, and dental trait superimposition, and in spite ofchallenges to the reliability of such evidence, the Courts, aftercarefully assessing the methodology adopted, accepted the findingreached by PW34 regarding the identification of the body, andthere was no error in such conclusion reached by the Courts.Therefore, the scientific evidence of PW34 was rightly believedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court, and strengthenedthe evidence of PWs 1 and 2 regarding the identification of thebody.

It is evidentfrom the depositions that the recovery of the dead body was madefrom the Tiger-Chola forest area, which was the same place towhich Accused No. 2 led the investigation team based on his543confession about disposal of the dead body. At this juncture thatmerely because the actual recovery of the body happened beforethe accused lead the police to the scene, it does not, in the factsand circumstances of this case, negate the validity of the recoverybased on a confession, in terms of Section 27 of the EvidenceAct. The recovery of the body of the deceased at the instance ofAccused No. 2 and the identification of the body as that of herhusband by PW1, her family as well as by the accused, on thebasis of photographs, the clothes and belongings of the deceased,and his scar, stood proved beyond all reasonable doubt.[Paras 39, 40] [566-C-G]Rohtash Kumar v.State of Haryana (2013) 14SCC 434 : [2013] 3 SCR 884 ; Trimukh Maroti Kirkanv.

This isvery crucial evidence to show that the Tata Sumo in which theaccused were travelling along with the deceased had in fact gonetowards Kodaikanal, as is evident from the fact that fuel was filledfrom a petrol pump enroute to Kodaikanal at Palani on the relevantdate. The overwhelming, consistent and reliable testimonies ofPWs 1 and 2, along with the corroborative evidence, conclusivelyproved the prosecution case. There was no embellishment orexaggeration in the evidence of these witnesses. Moreover, theevidence of the other prosecution witnesses was homogeneous,consistent and reliable, and corroborated the testimony of PWs1 and 2, which led to conclude that the chain of circumstanceswas complete and points solely at the guilt of the accused.[Paras 42, 43] [567-G-H; 568-A-C]Inder Singh v.

The said can hardly be a ground to convertthe conviction from Section 302 IPC to Section 304 Part I IPC. [2019] 5 S.C.R. 569569570 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.Applying the law laid down by this Court in the said decisions tothe facts of the case on hand and the reasoning given by the HighCourt while converting the conviction from section 302 to Section304 Part I, the reasons stated in the impugned Judgment andOrder, the judgment of the High Court is manifestly perverseand is totally contrary to the evidence on record. As per PW15, afracture of 4 cm length was found in the parietal and occipital. Healso stated that the said head injury was sufficient to cause deathin the ordinary course of nature. Thus, the accused used a deadlyweapon-axe on the vital part of the body-head, which proved tobe fatal. [Para 6.2, 7] [575-E; 576-G-H; 577-B-C]Arun Raj v. Union of India (2010) 6 SCC 457 : [2010]7 SCR 1; Ashokkumar Magabhai Vankar v. State ofGujarat (2011) 10 SCC 604 ; State of Rajasthan v. LeelaRam alias Leela Dhar 2019 (1) SCALE 544 \u2013 reliedon.Vijay Ramkrishan Gaikwad v. State of Maharashtra(2012) 11 SCC 592 \u2013 referred to.1.2 Another reason given by the High Court is that therewas no repeated injury, can hardly be a ground to convert theconviction from section 302 to section 304 Part I IPC. A singleblow on the vital part of the body like head and that too by deadlyweapon-axe and used with force which proved to be fatal, wassufficient to hold that it was a case of murder within the definitionof Section 300 IPC. [Para 8][577-C-D]1.3 Another reason given by the High Court is that in themorning on the day of the incident, there was an altercationbetween the accused and the deceased and so it can be said thatin the circumstances of the case there was no intention to causedeath on the part of the accused but the fact by which the deathwas caused appears to hold down that the intention of causingsuch bodily injury as was likely to cause death. The said is contraryto the evidence on record. It is not a case on behalf of the accusedthat there was an altercation between the accused and thedeceased at the time of commission of the offence. The altercation,if any, had taken place, in the morning and much earlier than thetime of incident. Merely because the altercation might have takenplace much earlier and not immediately prior to and/or at the571time of commission of the offence, it cannot be inferred that therewas no intention on the part of the accused to cause death of thedeceased. Thus, the judgment of the High Court is manifestlyperverse and is totally contrary to the evidence on record. TheHigh Court committed a grave error in altering the convictionfrom Section 302 IPC to Section 304 Part I IPC and thereforethe interference of this Court is warranted to obviate a completefailure of interest of justice. The impugned judgment of the HighCourt is set aside and that of the trial court convicting the accusedunder Section 302 IPC is restored. [Para 8.1, 9][577-E-H;578-A-C"

It is settled by **SBP & Co.\u2019s case that Section 16 ofthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 Act has full play onlyafter the arbitral tribunal is constituted, without intervention ofthe Court under Section 11. In view of the law laid down by seven\u0002Judge Bench, it is difficult to accept the submission that Section16 makes it clear that an arbitration agreement has anindependent existence of its own, and must be applied whiledeciding an application under Section 11 of the 1996 Act. It willbe seen that neither in the Statement of Objects and Reasonsnor in the Law Commission Report is there any mention of SMSTea Estates\u2019s case. This is for the very good reason that theSupreme Court or the High Court, while deciding a Section 11application, does not, in any manner, decide any preliminaryquestion that arises between the parties. The Supreme Court orthe High Court is only giving effect to the provisions of amandatory enactment which, no doubt, is to protect revenue. SMSTea Estates case has taken account of the mandatory provisionscontained in the Stamp Act and held them applicable to judicialauthorities, which would include the Supreme Court and the HighCourt acting under Section 11. A close look at Section 11(6A)would show that when the Supreme Court or the High Courtconsiders an application under Section 11(4) to 11(6), and comesacross an arbitration clause in an agreement or conveyance whichis unstamped, it is enjoined by the provisions of the Stamp Act tofirst impound the agreement or conveyance and see that stampduty and penalty (if any) is paid before the agreement, as a whole,can be acted upon. The Stamp Act applies to the agreement orconveyance as a whole. Therefore, it is not possible to bifurcatethe arbitration clause contained in such agreement or conveyanceso as to give it an independent existence. It is clear, therefore,that the introduction of Section 11(6A) does not, in any manner,deal with or get over the basis of the judgment in SMS TeaEstates\u2019s case, which continues to apply even after the amendmentof Section 11(6A). [Para 15, 16][602-G-H; 604-E-H; 605-A-D]1.2 When an arbitration clause is contained \u201cin a contract\u201d,it is significant that the agreement only becomes a contract if it is581enforceable by law. Under the Stamp Act, an agreement does notbecome a contract, namely, that it is not enforceable in law, unlessit is duly stamped. Therefore, even a plain reading of Section11(6A), when read with Section 7(2) of the 1996 Act and Section2(h) of the Contract Act, would make it clear that an arbitrationclause in an agreement would not exist when it is not enforceableby law. This is also an indicator that SMS Tea Estates case has, inno manner, been touched by the amendment of Section 11(6A).[Para 19][606-B-C]1.3 In the facts of the instant case, it is clear that thearbitration clause that is contained in the sub-contract would not\u201cexist\u201d as a matter of law until the sub\u2013contract is duly stamped.The argument that Section 11(6A) deals with \u201cexistence\u201d, asopposed to Section 8, Section 16, and Section 45, which deal with\u201cvalidity\u201d of an arbitration agreement is answered by this Court\u2019sunderstanding of the expression \u201cexistence\u201d in United IndiaInsurance Co.\u2019s case as followed by this Court. [Para 24][612-B-C]United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ors. v. HyundaiEngineering and Construction Co. Ltd. and Ors.2018SCC OnLine SC 1045 \u2013 relied on.1.4 It was submitted that the 60-day period under section11(13) would be breached if a document were to be impounded atthe stage of a section 11(6) application. Stamp duty, when paidwith penalty (if any), would require adjudication by the stampauthorities, which would take far more than the 60-day periodthat is laid down by Section 11(13). Undoubtedly, Section 11(13),which was also introduced by Amendment Act 3 of 2016, wasenacted keeping one of the important objectives of the 1996 Actin mind, namely, speedy disposal of disputes by the arbitraltribunal, and appointment of an arbitrator having to be made asexpeditiously as possible. Thus, a harmonious construction needsto be given to the provisions of the Maharashtra Stamp Act andSection 11(13) of the 1996 Act by which, if it is possible, bothprovisions ought to be subserved. Under the Maharashtra StampAct, the object of impounding an instrument that is unstamped isto ensure that stamp duty and penalty (if any) must be paid onGARWARE WALL ROPES LTD. v. COASTAL MARINECONSTRUCTIONS & ENGINEERING LTD.582 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.such instrument before it is acted upon by any authority. Likewise,under Section 11(13) of the 1996 Act, an application made underSection 11 for appointment of an arbitrator should be disposed ofas expeditiously as possible, and, in any event, an endeavourshall be made to dispose of such application at least within a periodof 60 days from the date of service of notice on the oppositeparty. [Para 26][613-C-F]1.5 The doctrine of harmonious construction of statutes isstrongly imbedded in the interpretative canon. One reasonableway of harmonising the provisions contained in Sections 33 and34 of the Maharashtra Stamp Act, which is a general statute insofaras it relates to safeguarding revenue, and Section 11(13) of the1996 Act, which applies specifically to speedy resolution ofdisputes by appointment of an arbitrator expeditiously, is bydeclaring that while proceeding with the Section 11 application,the High Court must impound the instrument which has not bornestamp duty and hand it over to the authority under theMaharashtra Stamp Act, who will then decide issues qua paymentof stamp duty and penalty (if any) as expeditiously as possible,and preferably within a period of 45 days from the date on whichthe authority receives the instrument. As soon as stamp dutyand penalty (if any) are paid on the instrument, any of the partiescan bring the instrument to the notice of the High Court, whichwill then proceed to expeditiously hear and dispose of the Section11 application.

[2019] 5 S.C.R. 618618619Allowing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Once an order had been passed by theDepartment, it was open to the respondent to challenge the saidorder by way of a Writ Petition, but the Contempt Jurisdictioncould not be invoked. The Contempt Court is to ensure that theorder of the Court is complied with. The order of the Court on23.10.2008 was to consider the case of the respondent forregularization of his services and for payment of minimum regularpay scale. Since the appellants considered the claim ofregularization and/or payment of minimum of pay scale, the onlyremedy of the respondent was by way of the Writ Petition. TheHigh Court exceeded the Contempt Jurisdiction to compel theofficers of the State to appear in court and in fact, the High Courttravelled much beyond the orders passed by the Single Benchon 23.10.2008. [Paras 15, 16][627-B-D]1.2 Grievance regarding regularization of the service onaccount of a break in service could not have been taken up inContempt proceedings, when such issue had attained finality inthe High Court. The High Court was not justified in passing ordersfrom time to time to secure presence of the officers. The officersof the State discharge public functions and duties. The ordersare generally presumed to be passed in good faith unless provedotherwise. The officers pass orders as a custodian of public money.Therefore, merely because an order has been passed, it doesnot warrant their personal presence. The summoning of officersto the court to attend proceedings, impinges upon the functioningof the officers and eventually it is the public at large who sufferon account of their absence from the duties assigned to them.The practice of summoning officers to court is not proper anddoes not serve the purpose of administration of justice in view ofthe separation of powers of the Executive and the Judiciary. If anorder is not legal, the Courts have ample jurisdiction to set asidesuch order and to issue such directions as may be warranted inthe facts of the case. Entire proceedings in Contempt ApplicationNo.1632 of 2009 were wholly unjustified and in excess ofjurisdiction vested with the Contempt Court. The ContemptApplication is dismissed.

In terms of compromiseentered into between the Plaintiff, the parents and three brothers,the properties were mutually divided amongst said six persons.Since \u2018AP\u2019 and \u2018DJ\u2019 were alive, the proper parties in an actionseeking relief of partition of joint family estate, going by the thenprevailing principles of Hindu Law, were only the husband, wifeand their sons. The daughters in the family, namely, DefendantNos.6 to 9 could not, as a matter of right, claim any share if thejoint family properties were to be partitioned. However, if apartition takes place between her husband and sons, a wife isentitled (except in Southern India) to receive a share equal tothat of a son and enjoy that share separately even from herhusband. Therefore, if the compromise was entered into betweenthe Plaintiff and Defendant Nos.1 to 5, there was nothing improperabout it. In the circumstances, the absence of any challenge tothe decree in 1966 Suit was irrelevant. As a matter of fact, theapplicant \u2018SJ\u2019 could not have challenged the decree in 1966 Suit.[Para 10][635-F-H; 636-A-C]1.2 On the death of the father and mother, if they diedintestate, then under the principles of the Hindu Succession Act,every Class I heir including the daughters, would be entitled to ashare in the property left behind by their parents. It is preciselyon this count that the applicant \u2018SJ\u2019 claims to be entitled to havea share in the properties which were allocated to her parents.The partition effected pursuant to decree in 1966 Suit cannot, inany way, disentitle her from claiming a share in the properties ofher father and mother. In the aforesaid premises, \u2018SJ\u2019 wasdefinitely a necessary and proper party to be impleaded in thesubsequent suit which was filed by \u2018MP\u2019. [Para 11][636-C-E]6331.3 The due execution of the Wills is yet to the proved bythe Respondents. If the Wills are not proved, the daughterswould be entitled to a share in the properties, being Class-I heirs.The daughters are, therefore, necessary parties to theproceedings. In the present case, if the Wills so propounded areproved, they will chart a course of succession other than thenormal mode of succession and to the prejudice of the daughters.In such an action or proceeding, the daughters being Class Iheirs are necessary and proper parties and are required to beimpleaded. \u2018SJ\u2019s\u2019 application to be impleaded as one of thedefendants in the suit, was erroneously rejected by the courtsbelow. The order passed by the courts below, set aside and theapplication filed under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC by the applicant\u2018SJ\u2019 is allowed. [Paras 12, 13][636-F-G; 637-A-B]"

There is no provision in the Official Secrets Act and nosuch provision in any other statute has been brought to noticeby which Parliament has vested any power in the executive armof the government either to restrain publication of documentsmarked as secret or from placing such documents before a Courtof Law which may have been called upon to adjudicate a legalissue concerning the parties. [Para 5][654-C]2. Insofar as the claim of privilege is concerned, on thevery face of it, Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872relates to unpublished public records. The three documents havebeen published in different editions of \u2018The Hindu\u2019 newspaper.That apart, a claim of immunity against disclosure under Section123 of the Indian Evidence Act has to be essentially adjudged onthe touchstone of public interest and to satisfy itself that publicinterest is not put to jeopardy by requiring disclosure the Courtmay even inspect the document in question though the said powerhas to be sparingly exercised. Such an exercise, however, wouldnot be necessary in the instant case as the document(s) being inpublic domain and within the reach and knowledge of the entirecitizenry, a practical and common sense approach would lead tothe obvious conclusion that it would be a meaningless and anexercise in utter futility for the Court to refrain from reading andconsidering the said document or from shutting out its evidentiaryworth and value. [Para 6][654-D-F]6413. Section 8(2) of the Right to Information Act, 2005contemplates that notwithstanding anything in the Official SecretsAct and the exemptions permissible under sub-section (1) ofSection 8, a public authority would be justified in allowing accessto information, if on proper balancing, public interest in disclosureoutweighs the harm sought to be protected. When the documentsin question are already in the public domain, how the protectionunder Section 8(1)(a) of the Act would serve public interest. Thereview petitions will have to be adjudicated on their own meritby taking into account the relevance of the contents of the threedocuments, admissibility of which, in the judicial decision makingprocess, has been sought to be questioned by the respondentsin the review petitions.

Law in India relating to Crown privilege as it wasoriginally styled in England is mainly embedded in a statutoryprovision namely Section 123 of the Indian Evidence Act. AlsoSection 124 of the said Act is relied upon in the affidavit of theSecretary. There can be no matter of doubt that Section 124 isYASHWANT SINHA v. CBI THR. ITS DIRECTOR642 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.confined to public officers and the decisive aspect even underSection 124 is the protection of public interest. Section 162 dealswith the aspect of inspection of documents covered by privilege.In England, the law relating to privilege has been entirely courtmade. The claim for privilege under Section 123 of the IndianEvidence Act being based on public policy cannot be waived. Thebasis for the claim of privilege is and can only be publicinterest.[Paras 7, 8][660-C-F]S.P. Gupta v. Union of India 1981 (Suppl) SCC 87 :[1982] SCR 365 ; M/s. Doypack Systems Pvt.

[Para 18][668-B-D]2.2 Parliament has indeed intended to strengthendemocracy and has sought to introduce the highest levels oftransparency and openness. With the passing of the Right toInformation Act, the citizens fundamental right of expressionunder Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, which itself643has been recognised as encompassing, a basket of rights hasbeen given fruitful meaning. Section 8(2) of the Act manifests alegal revolution that has been introduced in that, none of theexemptions declared under sub-section(1) of Section 8 or theOfficial Secrets Act, 1923 can stand in the way of the access toinformation if the public interest in disclosure overshadows, theharm to the protected interests. [Para 19][668-E-G]2.3 It is true that under Section 8(1)(a), information thedisclosure of which will prejudicially affect the sovereignty andintegrity of India, the security and strategic security and strategicscientific or economic interests of the State, relation with foreignState or information leading to incitement of an offence areordinarily exempt from the obligation of disclosure but even inrespect of such matters Parliament has advanced the law in amanner which can only be described as dramatic by givingrecognition to the principle that disclosure of information couldbe refused only on the foundation of public interest beingjeopardised. Under the law relating to privilege there are twoclasses of documents which ordinarily form the basis of privilege.In the first category, the claim for privilege is raised on the basisof contents of the particular documents. The second head underwhich privilege is ordinarily claimed is that the document is adocument which falls in a class of documents which entitles it toprotection from disclosure and production. When a documentfalls in such a class, ordinarily courts are told that it suffices andthe court may not consider the contents. When privilege wasclaimed as for instance in the matter relating to security of thenation, traditionally, courts both in England and in India have heldthat such documents would fall in the class of documents whichentitles it to protection from production. The RTI Act throughSection 8(2) has conferred upon the citizens a priceless right byclothing them with the right to demand information even in respectof such matters as security of the country and matters relating torelation with foreign state. No doubt, information is not be givenfor the mere asking. The applicant must establish that withholdingof such information produces greater harm than disclosing it.[Para 20][668-H; 669-A-B; E-H]YASHWANT SINHA v. CBI THR. ITS DIRECTOR644 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.3.1 An officer of the department is permitted under theRTI Act to allow access to information under the Act in respectof matters falling even under Section 8(1)(a) if a case is made outunder Section 8(2). If an officer does not accede to the request,a citizen can pursue remedies before higher authorities and finallythe courts. In this case in fact, the documents in respect of whichthe privilege is claimed are already on record. Section 123 of theEvidence Act in fact contemplates a situation where party seeksthe production of document which is with a public authority andthe public authority raises claim for privilege by contending thatthe document cannot be produced by it. Undoubtedly, thefoundation for such a claim is based on public interest. Under thecommon law both in England and in India the context for materialbeing considered by the court is relevancy. There can be nodispute that the manner in which evidence is got namely that itwas procured in an illegal manner would not ordinarily be verysignificant in itself in regard to the courts decision to act uponthe same.

Raj Narain AIR 1975 SC865 : [1975] 3 SCR 333 \u2013 relied on3.2 The documents in question were published in \u2018TheHindu\u2019, a national daily. It is true that they have not been officiallypublished. The correctness of the contents per se of thedocuments were not questioned. Lastly, the case does not strictlyinvolve in a sense the claim for privilege as the petitioners havenot called upon the respondents to produce the original and theState does not take objection to the correctness of the contentsof the documents. The request of the respondents is to removethe documents from the record. In regard to documents whichare improperly obtained and which are subject to a claim forprivilege, undoubtedly the ordinary rule of relevancy alone maynot suffice as larger public interest may warrant in a given caserefusing to legitimise what is forbidden on grounds of overridingpublic interest.

Film releasedon 15 Feb. 19. However, within a day of its release anoverwhelming majority of the exhibitors abruptly took the filmoff their screens. The tickets were being refunded to the viewerswithout any reason being offered by the exhibitors. Hence, thepresent petition.Allowing the writ petition, the CourtHELD: 1.1 The police are not in a free society the self\u0002appointed guardians of public morality. The uniformed authorityof their force is subject to the rule of law. They cannot arrogateto themselves the authority to be willing allies in the suppressionof dissent and obstruction of speech and expression. The JointCommissioner was not unmindful of the fact that the film hadbeen slated for release within a few days of his communication intheatres across the city of Kolkata and the State. If there wasany doubt whatever over the entitlement of the producers to havethe film exhibited, it was laid to rest when the producersimmediately informed him of the film being CBFC certified. Thestatutory authority to certify a film for public exhibition is vestedin the CBFC under the provisions of the Cinematograph Act1952. Sections 4, 5, 5A and 5B provided a statutory code for theexamination and certification of films for public exhibition. Sub\u0002section (1) of Section 5B provides for the grounds on which afilm may not be certified for public exhibition. An order refusingto grant certification is subject to the remedies stipulated in theAct. The State Act (Section 6 of the West Bengal Cinemas(Regulation) Act 1954) and the Central Act (Section 13 of theCinematograph Act 1952) provide the conditions in which thestate government, or as the case may be, the central government(or a local authority) may suspend the exhibition of a film, whereit is likely to cause a breach of the peace. Any order which isissued under the terms of these statutory provisions is subjectto statutory control as well as to the supervisory jurisdiction ofthe High Courts under Article 226 or, as the case may be, theoriginal jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32. These statutesare to be interpreted in the rule of law framework. An excess orabuse of statutory power is amenable to constitutional guaranteeswhich protect the citizen against arbitrary State action. The dangerINDIBILITY CREATIVE PVT LTD. v. GOVT OF WESTBENGAL682 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.which this case exemplifies is the peril of subjecting the freedomof speech and expression of the citizen to actions which are notcontemplated by the statute and lie beyond the lawful exercise ofpublic power. All exercises of authority in pursuance of enablingstatutory provisions are amenable to statutory remedies and aresubject to judicial oversight under a regime of constitutionalremedies. The exercise of statutory authority is not uncontrolledin a regime based on the rule of law. But what do citizens whohave a legitimate right to exhibit a film confront when they aretold that a film which is duly certified and slated for release isunceremoniously pulled off the exhibiting theatres without theauthority of law? Such attempts are insidious and pose a gravedanger to personal liberty and to free speech and expression.They are insidious because they are not backed by the authorityof law. They pose grave dangers to free speech because thecitizen is left in the lurch without being informed of the causes orthe basis of the action. This has the immediate effect of silencingspeech and the expression of opinion. Contemporary eventsreveal that there is a growing intolerance: intolerance which isunaccepting of the rights of others in society to freely espousetheir views and to portray them in print, in the theatre or in thecelluloid media. Organised groups and interests pose a seriousdanger to the existence of the right to free speech and expression.If the right of the play-wright, artist, musician or actor were to besubjected to popular notions of what is or is not acceptable, theright itself and its guarantee under the Constitution would berendered illusory. The true purpose of art, as manifest in its myriadforms, is to question and provoke. Art in an elemental sensereflects a human urge to question the assumptions on whichsocietal values may be founded. In questioning prevailing socialvalues and popular cultures, every art form seeks to espouse avision. Underlying the vision of the artist is a desire to find a newmeaning for existence. The artist, in an effort to do so, is entitledto the fullest liberty and freedom to critique and criticize. Satireand irony are willing allies of the quest to entertain while at thesame time to lead to self-reflection. Art is as much for themainstream as it is for the margins. The Constitution protectsthe ability of every individual citizen to believe as much as tocommunicate, to conceptualize as much as to share. Public power683must be conscious of the fact that ours is a democracy simplybecause the Constitution recognizes the inalienable freedoms ofevery citizen. Power has been entrusted to the State by the peopleunder a written Constitution. The State holds it in trust and itsexercise is accountable to the people. The State does not entrustfreedoms to the people: the freedoms which the Constitutionrecognizes are inseparable from our existence as human beings.Freedom is the defining feature of human existence. Freedomsare not subject to power. Public power is assigned by the peopleto government. Ours is a controlled Constitution, a Constitutionwhich recognizes the fullest element of liberty and freedom andof the answerability of power to freedom. The views of the writerof a play, the metre of a poet or the sketches of a cartoonist maynot be palatable to those who are criticized. Those who disagreehave a simple expedient : of not watching a film, not turning thepages of the book or not hearing what is not music to their ears.The Constitution does not permit those in authority who disagreeto crush the freedom of others to believe, think and express.The ability to communicate \u2018ideas\u2019 is a legitimate area of humanendeavor and is not controlled by the acceptability of the viewsto those to whom they are addressed. When the ability to portrayart in any form is subject to extra constitutional authority, thereis a grave danger that fundamental human freedoms will beimperiled by a cloud of opacity and arbitrary State behaviour. Aproducer of a film which has been certified by the CBFC needsto embark upon meticulous arrangements including contracts forthe exhibition of the film. The wielding of extra constitutionalauthority is destructive of legitimate expectations. Under theconstitutional scheme, restrictions can only be imposed by orunder a law which is made by the State. The State of West Bengalinformed the Court that it had not taken recourse to its statutorypowers either under State or Union legislation. The apprehensionof the petitioners that this was an action which followed on theletter dated 11 February 2019 of the Joint Commissioner of Policeis not unfounded. The letter addressed by INOX to the producerspecifically mentions that they were directed by the authoritiesto discontinue the screening in the \u2018interest of the guests\u2019. Thiswas a clear abuse of public power. The police are entrusted withenforcing law. In the present case, the West Bengal police haveINDIBILITY CREATIVE PVT LTD. v. GOVT OF WESTBENGAL684 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.overreached their statutory powers and became instruments in aconcerted attempt to silence speech, suborn views critical ofprevailing cultures and threaten law abiding citizens intosubmission. [Paras 16, 17][708-C-E; 709-A-C; 710-A-H;711-A-H; 712-A]1.2 The freedoms which are guaranteed by Article 19 areuniversal. Article 19(1) stipulates that all citizens shall have thefreedoms which it recognises. Political freedoms impose arestraining influence on the State by carving out an area in whichthe State shall not interfere. Hence, these freedoms are perceivedto impose obligations of restraint on the State. But, apart fromimposing \u2018negative\u2019 restraints on the State these freedoms imposea positive mandate as well. In its capacity as a public authorityenforcing the rule of law, the State must ensure that conditions inwhich these freedoms flourish are maintained. In the spacereserved for the free exercise of speech and expression, the Statecannot look askance when organized interests threaten theexistence of freedom. The State is duty bound to ensure theprevalence of conditions in which of those freedoms can beexercised. The instruments of the State must be utilized toeffectuate the exercise of freedom. When organized intereststhreaten the properties of theatre owners or the viewing audiencewith reprisals, it is the plain duty of the State to ensure that speechis not silenced by the fear of the mob. In the present case, therehas been an unconstitutional attempt to invade the fundamentalrights of the producers, the actors and the audience. Worse still,by making an example out of them, there has been an attempt tosilence criticism and critique. Others who embark upon a similarventure would be subject to the chilling effect of \u2018similarmisadventures\u2019. This cannot be countenanced in a free society.Freedom is not a supplicant to power. By the orders of this Courtdated 15 March 2019 and 25 March 2019 several directions wereissued to the State of West Bengal, the Principal Secretary, Homeand the Director General of Police. The directions issued aremaintained and confirmed. A Mandamus is issued restraining theState from taking recourse to any form of extra constitutionalmeans to prevent the lawful screening of the feature filmBhobishyoter Bhoot. The State shall specifically ensure that the685properties of the theatre owners who exhibit the film are dulyprotected as are the viewers against attempts on their safety.[Paras 18, 19][712-A-H]1.3 As a consequence of the pulling off of the film from thetheatres where it was screened on 16 February 2019, thepetitioners have suffered a violation of their fundamental right tofree speech and expression and of their right to pursue a lawfulbusiness. This has been occasioned by the acts of commissionand, in any event, of omission on the part of the State in failing toaffirm, fulfill and respect the fundamental freedoms of thepetitioners. A remedy in public law for the grant of remedialcompensation is required in the present case. The respondentsare directed to pay to the petitioners compensation quantified atRs 20 lakhs within a period of one month from the date of thepresent judgment. The petitioners shall be entitled to the costsof the proceedings quantified at Rs 1 lakh, to be paid over withinone month. [Paras 20, 21][713-A-C]Romesh Thapar v.

Section 273 Cr.P.C. opens with the expression\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided\u2026\u201d. By its very nature, [2019] 5 S.C.R. 714714715the exceptions to the application of Section 273 must be thosewhich are expressly provided in the Cr.P.C. Sections 299 and317 are such express exceptions provided in the Cr.P.C. In thecircumstances mentioned in Sections 299 and 317, the Courtswould be justified in recording evidence in the absence of theaccused. Under its latter part, Section 273 also provides for asituation in which evidence could be recorded in the absence ofthe accused, when it says \u201cwhen his personal attendance isdispensed with, in the presence of his pleader\u201d. In the presentcase, there was no dispensation and yet the evidence was recordedwithout ensuring the presence of the accused. The High Courtwas, therefore, absolutely right in concluding that Section 273stood violated in the present matter and that there was aninfringement of the salutary principle under Section 273.[Para 18][730-F-G; 731-B-C]2. Chapter XXXV of the Cr.P.C. deals with \u201cIrregularProceedings\u201d, and Section 461 stipulates certain infringementsor irregularities which vitiate proceedings. Barring thosestipulated in Section 461, the thrust of the Chapter is that anyinfringement or irregularity would not vitiate the proceedingsunless, as a result of such infringement or irregularity, greatprejudice had occasioned to the accused. The right of the accusedto watch the prosecution witness is a valuable right and therewas an infringement of such right in the present case. In thepresent matter, it was not the direction of the High Court to readthe entire evidence on the earlier occasion as evidence in the denovo trial. The direction is to re-examine those witnesses whowere not examined in the presence of the appellants. Thedirection now ensures the presence of the appellants in the Court,so that they have every opportunity to watch the witnessesdeposing in the trial and cross-examine said witnesses. Sincethese basic requirements would be scrupulously observed andcomplied with, there is no prejudice at all. [Paras 19 and 20][731-F-G; 731-C-D; 733-D-E]Jayendra Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtraand Anr. (2009) 7 SCC 104:[2009] 8 SCR 591\u2013 distinguished.ATMA RAM & ORS. v. STATE OF RAJASTHAN716 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [2019] 5 S.C.R.3. The proceedings under Chapter XXVIII of Cr.P.C. whichdeals with \u201csubmission of death sentences for confirmation\u201d is aproceeding in continuation of the trial. The provisions in thisChapter thus entitle the High Court to direct further enquiry orto take additional evidence and the High Court may, in a givencase, even acquit the accused person. The scope of the chapteris wider. Chapter XXIX of Cr.P.C. deals with \u201cAppeals\u201d. Thepowers of Appellate Court are equally wide. The High Court inthe present case was exercising powers both under ChaptersXXVIII and XXIX of Cr.P.C. If the power can go to the extent ofordering a complete re-trial, the exercise of power to a lesserextent namely ordering de novo examination of twelve witnesseswith further directions as the High Court has imposed in thepresent matter, was certainly within the powers of the High Court.There is, thus, no infraction or jurisdictional error on the part ofthe High Court. [Para 22][736-F-H; 737-A-B]4. It is true that an order of retrial of a criminal case is notto be taken resort to easily and must be made in exceptionalcases. The order passed by the High Court in the present matterwas not to enable the Prosecutor to rectify the defects orinfirmities in the evidence or to enable him to lead evidence whichhe had not cared to lead on the earlier occasion. The evidence inthe form of testimony of those twelve witnesses was led and thosewitnesses were cross-examined. There was no infirmity exceptthe one that the evidence was not led in the presence of theappellants. The remedy proposed was only to rectify suchinfirmity, and not to enable the Prosecutor to rectify defects inthe evidence. [Para 23 and 24][737-B-C; 738-A-C]5. The matter should also be considered from the standpoint and perspective of the victims. It is certainly in the societalinterest that the guilty must be punished and at the same timethe procedural requirements which ensure fairness in trial mustbe adhered to. If there was an infraction, which otherwise doesnot vitiate the trial by itself, the attempt must be to remedy thesituation to the extent possible, so that the interests of the accusedas well as societal interest are adequately safeguarded. The verysame witnesses were directed to be de novo examined which would717ensure that the interest of the prosecution is subserved and atthe same time the accused will have every right and opportunityto watch the witnesses deposing against them, watch theirdemeanor and instruct their counsel properly so that saidwitnesses can be effectively cross-examined. In the process, theinterest of the accused would also stand protected. If it wereheld that the proceedings stood vitiated and, therefore, the HighCourt was powerless to order de novo examination of theconcerned witnesses, it would result in great miscarriage ofjustice. The persons who are accused of committing four murderswould not effectively be tried. The evidence against them wouldnot be read for a technical infraction resulting in great miscarriage.Viewed thus, the order and directions passed by the High Courtcompletely ensure that a fair procedure is adopted and thedepositions of the witnesses, after due distillation from their cross\u0002examination can be read in evidence.
