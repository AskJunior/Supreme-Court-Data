R. Parmar case it was laid down that the date of requisition forfilling up the posts by a particular recruitment process could betaken as the year to which seniority could be given to personsrecruited under that process \u2013 However, the Court also clearly laiddown that this would apply only if the recruitment year is the sameas the year of vacancy \u2013 In the instant case, the requisition of directrecruits was sent in the year 2007, the vacancies related to the year2009 and therefore, the CAT as well as the High Court rightly heldthat direct recruits were not entitled to promotion from the year2007 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.77 and 309 \u2013 Indian RailwaysEstablishment Code \u2013 Government of India (Allocation of Business)Rules, 1961 \u2013 cl.3"
