VI, r.4. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.68 \u2013 Appellants-plaintiffs are sons of the Donor (since deceased) \u2013 During his life time, the Donor purportedly executed gift deed in favour of the defendant-donee \u2013 Trial Court recorded finding that the property was ancestral \u2013 Upheld by the First Appellate Court \u2013 High Court held that the property was not ancestral in the hands of the Donor and hence, he was competent to execute the gift deed \u2013 Held: s.68 makes it mandatory to examine one of the attesting witnesses for the purpose of proving of the execution of Will but such limitation is not applicable in respect of proof of execution of any document which has been registered in accordance with provisions of the 1908 Act, unless the execution is specifically denied \u2013 In the present case, the entire reading of the plaint does not show that there was any specific denial of execution of the gift deed \u2013 Thus, in view of the absence of specific denial of the execution of the gift deed, the Donee was under no obligation to examine one of the attesting witnesses of the gift deed\u2013 Indian Registration Act, 1908."

Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 \u2013 ss. 14, 35 and 37 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Does Provisions of the 2002 Act override the provisions of the Cr.P.C, whereunder the functions to be discharged by the CMM are similar to that of the CJM \u2013 Held: The expressions \u2018CMM\u2019 and \u2018CJM\u2019 are used interchangeably in Cr. P.C. and are considered as synonymous to each other \u2013 s.14, even if read literally, in no manner denotes that allocation of jurisdictions and powers to CMM and CJM under the Code of Criminal Procedure are modified by the 2002 Act \u2013 Thus understood, s.14 of the 2002 Act, stricto sensu, cannot be construed as being inconsistent with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure or vice-versa in that regard \u2013 Further, s.37 of the 2002 Act predicates that the provisions of the 2002 Act or the Rules made thereunder shall be in addition to the stated enactments or \u201cany other law for the time being in force\u201d \u2013 Having said that the Provisions of the s.14 of the 2002 Act are in no way inconsistent with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it must then follow that the provisions of the 2002 Act are in addition to and not in derogation of the Code."

Service law: Promotion Policy \u2013 Judicial review of \u2013 The Promotion Policy can be struck down only if the policy has no reasonable nexus with the objective to be achieved and is discriminatory \u2013 The lack of vacancy is not a ground on the basis of which promotion policy can be struck down \u2013 In the instant case, mere fact that the appellant could not be promoted on account of non-availability of vacancies before his superannuation is not a ground on which the Promotion Policy can be struck down \u2013 Administrative law."

Rathinaswami's case - Bringing forth from the direct recruitment quota (for which the qualification is the Degree) to the promotion quota and giving that through accelerated promotion for such persons who have degree can hardly have any intrinsic defects which could violate Arts.14 & 16 - Historical perspective also hardly supports the private respondents as even the State of Uttar Pradesh, as it existed earlier, and the Rules as they existed then, provided for such 7.33% quota, which was never assailed by any party - Impugned judgment unsustainable and the challenge to the Rule is misplaced - Writ petition of the Diploma-holders dismissed - Constitution of India - Arts. 14, 16 - Uttaranchal Service of Engineers (Irrigation Department) (Group 'B') Rules, 2003 - Uttar Pradesh Public Works Department Assistant Engineers (Civil) Services Rules, 2003 - United Provinces Service of Engineers (Buildings and Roads Branch) Class II Rules - Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department Civil Engineer (Subordinate) Service Regulation, 1992 -Uttar Pradesh Service of Engineers (Irrigation Department) (Group 'B') Service Rules, 1993."

        "HeadNote": "Consumer Protection \u2013 Vehicles of guests handed over to the hotels for valet parking \u2013 Liability of hotels in case of theft/loss \u2013 Bailor-bailee relationship under the Contract Act, if exists \u2013 Respondent no.2\u2019s car parked under the valet parking of the appellant-hotel \u2013 Car driven away by another person\u2013 Respondent no.1 (insurer) settled the insurance claim by respondent no.2 \u2013 Both filed complaint against the appellant \u2013 Dismissed by the State Commission on the locus standi of the insurer \u2013 National Commission remanded the complaint back to the State Commission which allowed the complaint \u2013 National Commission dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant \u2013 Held: Complaint filed by the insurer as subrogee, along with the original owner as co-complainant is maintainable \u2013 In a situation where the hotel actively undertakes to park the vehicle for the owner, keep it in safe custody and return it upon presentation of parking slip in a manner such that the parking of the vehicle is beyond the control of the owner, a contract of bailment exists \u2013 Hotel liable as a bailee for returning the vehicle in the condition in which it was delivered \u2013 However, imposition of strict liability under common law for loss or damage to vehicles of guests is overly burdensome and should not be given effect in the Indian context, instead, the rule of prima facie negligence should be adopted \u2013 To this extent, the National Commission erred in adopting the common law rule \u2013 Under ss.151 & 152, 1872 Act, the bailee has duty to keep its premises in a condition of safety, reasonable to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the goods of its guests \u2013 Responsibility to take such measures is higher with respect to 5-star hotels \u2013 Hotel cannot refute the existence of bailment by contending that its valet parking service was complimentary in nature and that the consumer (bailor) had not paid for the same \u2013 Burden of proof is on the hotel (bailee) to show that it took efforts to take reasonable care of the vehicle bailed, and the theft did not occur due to its neglect/misconduct \u2013 Entire case of the appellant is premised on the exclusion clause in the notice, and not on the absence of negligent conduct on its part \u2013 There was an admission of the fact that one of the three young boys who had visited the hotel, stole the car of respondent no.2 while its keys were under the watch of the valet driver \u2013 Theft of the respondent no.2\u2019s car was result of the appellant\u2019s negligence \u2013 Exemption clause on the parking tag will not exclude its liability \u2013 Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.148, 149, 151, 152 \u2013 Principle of strict liability for vehicles infra hospitium; Prima facie liability rule. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.151, 152 \u2013 Standard of care to be taken by the bailee (hotel) for the vehicles parked within its premises \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Consumer Protection. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.148, 149 \u2013 \u2018Delivery\u2019 under \u2013 When \u2013 Held: In a scenario where possession of the vehicle is handed over to hotel employee for valet parking, it can be said that \u2018delivery\u2019 of the vehicle has been made for the purposes of s.148 and 149 \u2013 Consequently, a relationship of bailment is created \u2013 Parking token so handed over to the bailor is evidence of a contract, by which the bailee (hotel) undertakes to park the car and return it in a suitable condition when the vehicle owner so directs \u2013 Consumer Protection. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.151, 152 \u2013 Vehicles of guests parked under the valet parking of the hotels \u2013 Loss/theft of \u2013 Distinction between gratuitous bailee and bailee for reward \u2013 If any \u2013 Held: ss.151 and 152 do not distinguish between a gratuitous bailee and a bailee for reward \u2013 It is irrelevant as to how much parking fee was paid by the consumer, or whether any parking fee was paid at all, as the duty of care required to be taken by the hotel will be the same in all circumstances \u2013 However, this is not a strict liability standard insofar as s.152 excludes the liability of a bailee for loss or damage of the bailed goods if he is able to show that he fulfilled the standard of reasonable care u/s.151 \u2013 Whether or not such standard of reasonable care was fulfilled will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case \u2013 Consumer Protection. Words & Phrases \u2013 \u2018in the absence of any special contract\u2019 in s.152, 1872 Act \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: Though courts may have construed the phrase \u2018in the absence of any special contract\u2019 in s.152 to mean that a bailee can reduce his liability u/s.151 but, such an interpretation is incorrect \u2013 Words \u2018in the absence of any special contract\u2019 in s.152 clearly indicate that it is open to the bailee to accept a higher standard of liability than s.151 under contract, and not otherwise \u2013 However, this does not mean that the hotel would be liable in all scenarios or that it cannot impose any exemption clause through a contract \u2013 Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.151, 152 \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Consumer Protection."

Evidence Act, 1872: s.106 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: As regards the applicability of s.106 of the Evidence Act, it was proved by cogent evidence that the body of the missing boy was found in the house of the main accused \u2013 By applying the provision under s.106, burden was on the accused to explain the fact within the knowledge of them how the body of the boy came to be buried in their house \u2013 Penal Code, 1860. Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Punishment for murder \u2013 It is clearly well settled that normal punishment for the offence under s.302 IPC is life imprisonment but in a case where incident is of \u201crarest of rare cases\u201d death sentence is to be imposed \u2013 It is equally well settled that only special facts and circumstances will warrant passing of death sentence and a just balance has to be struck between aggravating and mitigating circumstances, before the option is exercised \u2013 To come to conclusion in each case aggravating and mitigating circumstances are to be considered \u2013 Further factors like, age of the accused, possibility of reformation, gravity of the offence etc. are also to be kept in mind \u2013 In this case, evidence on record showed that the two main accused, committed the murder of the two year old child as a sacrifice to the God \u2013 They had three minor children at that time \u2013 Inspite of the same, they committed the murder of two year old child brutally \u2013 The head of the helpless child was severed, his tongue and cheeks were also cut \u2013 Having regard to age of the accused, they were not possessed of the basic humanness, they completely lacked the psyche or mindset which can be amenable for any reformation \u2013 It was a planned murder committed by the two appellants \u2013 Appellants who were the main accused were also convicted on an earlier occasion for similar murder of a 6 year old girl \u2013 Such conviction for similar offence can be considered as aggravating factor \u2013 This is a case of \u201crarest of rare cases\u201d where death sentence imposed by the trial court was rightly confirmed by the High Court \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Crime against children."

Evidence: Confession made to police \u2013 The confessional statements made to the police cannot be the basis to prove the guilt of the appellants but at the same time there is no reason to discard the confessions made to the independent witnesses at the time when boy\u2019s body was found, prior to the arrival of police \u2013 Extra judicial confession, is a weak piece of evidence but at the same time if the same is corroborated by other evidences on record, such confession can be taken into consideration to prove the guilt of the accused \u2013 Penal Code, 1860."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.313 \u2013 Plea of appellant that they were seriously prejudiced in their defence because proper opportunity to defend was denied under s.313 as the incriminating questions put to them were extremely casual and perfunctory \u2013 Held: s.313 incorporates the principle of audi alteram partem \u2013 It provides an opportunity to the accused for his defence by making him aware fully of the prosecution allegations against him and to answer the same in support of his innocence \u2013 But equally there cannot be a generalised presumption of prejudice to an accused merely by reason of any omission or inadequate questions put to him \u2013 Ultimately it will be a question to be considered in the facts and circumstances of each case including the nature of other evidence available, the kind of questions put to an accused, considered with anything further that the accused may state in his defence \u2013 In the facts of the instant case, considering the nature of ocular evidence available of the injured witnesses P.Ws. 7 and 8 who were also cross-examined by the appellants, no prejudice was caused to the appellants \u2013 A specific question was put to the appellants that they participated in an unlawful assembly with the common object of murdering the deceased \u2013 Further, it was also put to them that they had caused injuries to P.W. 7 and 8 \u2013 Merely because no questions were put to the appellants with regard to the individual assault made by each of them, it cannot be said in the facts of the case that any prejudice was caused to them \u2013 Appellants did not offer any explanation or desire to lead evidence except for stating that they were falsely implicated. Criminal Law: Absence of injury report of injured eye witnesses \u2013 Effect on prosecution case \u2013 Prosecution case was that P.W. 8 and deceased were going together when they were surrounded and assaulted by the accused persons \u2013 There was no lacunae in the evidence or cross-examination of the witness to doubt his presence and the injuries suffered by him in the same occurrence \u2013 P.W. 7, a resident of the locality and an independent witness also suffered injuries during the same occurrence \u2013 P.W. 8 during the course of his deposition also showed the scars caused to him by his injuries, noticed by the trial judge \u2013 The statement of the two witnesses also stated to have been recorded at the hospital \u2013 The fact that there was no injury report, can at best be classified as a defective investigation but cannot raise doubts about the credibility of their being injured witnesses in the same occurrence \u2013 The officer-in\u0002charge of the police station where the deceased and injured were taken, specifically deposed that he submitted a request for the injury report of the witnesses and pursuant to which their injury reports were made available to him \u2013 Only thereafter the charge sheet was submitted by him \u2013 There was no material in his cross-examination to discredit his statements \u2013 Investigation, defect in. Penal Code, 1860: ss.302/149 and ss.323/149 \u2013 Conviction under \u2013 Appellants were undoubtedly the members of an unlawful assembly some of whom were also armed with spears and assaulted the deceased \u2013 All the accused surrounded the deceased obviously to prevent his escape \u2013 The initial assault was made on the head of the deceased with the lathi by appellant-S \u2013 The deceased fell down and when he was trying to stand up, he was assaulted by two persons with spears \u2013 P.W. 7 was assaulted on the head by appellant-F \u2013 In the fracas the fact that the assault by appellant-M landed on the thigh of the witness was not of much relevance \u2013 Likewise, P.W. 8 was assaulted by appellant-S on the face and head \u2013 The fact that the co-accused may have assaulted on the head again cannot be considered very relevant to eschew the absence of common object \u2013 No reason to interfere with the order of conviction."

Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.16(1)(c) \u2013 Suit for specific performance of contract \u2013 Readiness and willingness of plaintiff to perform his part of contract \u2013 Trial Court decreed the suit on 01.06.1994 and granted time to the plaintiff for deposit of the balance consideration within two months \u2013 Plaintiff offered no explanation whatsoever for the failure to comply the direction \u2013 After expiry of the time granted for deposit, plaintiff filed an application before the Trial Court that in view of the pendency of the First Appeal preferred by defendants, the time for deposit may be extended as otherwise the amount would lie in the bank without interest \u2013 Time for deposit was extended till disposal of the First Appeal \u2013 Held: The failure of the plaintiff to offer any explanation why the balance consideration was not deposited within the time granted, the filing of the application for extension of time after expiry of the prescribed period coupled with the frivolousness of the grounds taken in the application for extension that the money would lie in the bank without earning interest, were all but evidence of incapacity on part of the plaintiff to perform his obligations under the agreement and reflective of lack of readiness and willingness \u2013 The grant of relief for specific performance under s.16(1)(c) of the Act is a discretionary and equitable relief \u2013 The plea that the amount would lie in the bank without interest is unfounded and contrary to normal banking practice \u2013 This is sufficient evidence of the incapacity or lack of readiness and willingness on part of the plaintiff to perform his obligations \u2013 Undoubtedly, the time for deposit could be extended under s.28 of the Act \u2013 But the mere extension of time for deposit does not absolve the plaintiff of his obligation to demonstrate readiness and willingness coupled with special circumstances beyond his control to seek such extension \u2013 The pendency of an appeal by the defendant did not preclude the plaintiff from depositing the amount in proof of his readiness and willingness \u2013 High Court has rightly observed that there was no stay by the Appellate Court of the decree under appeal to justify non-deposit during the pendency of the appeal \u2013 There was no infirmity in the order of the High Court concluding that the plaintiff in the facts and circumstances was not ready and willing to perform his obligations."

Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: Even marginal deviation from the prescribed standard cannot be ignored \u2013 In cases of food coming under the Act, it is not required to prove that article of food was injurious to health \u2013 If an article of food fails to comply with the standards then it will have to be treated as an adulterated article even if it is not rendered injurious to health \u2013 If the standards are not complied with, the Court is not justified in acquitting the accused charged with adulteration only on the ground that the deficiency is marginal. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.433 \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Commutation of sentence \u2013 Held: The powers under s.433 can only be exercised by the appropriate Government \u2013 This power of the appropriate Government cannot be usurped by the courts and the Government cannot be directed to pass \u2018formal compliance order\u2019. Constitution of India: Art.142 \u2013 The power under Art.142 cannot be exercised against the specific provision of law \u2013 s.16(1)(a) of the PFA Act lays down a minimum sentence of six months \u2013 Considering the bane of adulteration and the deleterious effect of adulteration and sub-standard food on the health of the citizens (especially children when milk is involved), the Legislature provided a minimum sentence of six months \u2013 Passage of time can be no excuse to award a sentence lower than the minimum \u2013 Furthermore, the power under Art.142 cannot be used in total violation of the law \u2013 When a minimum sentence is prescribed by law, this Court cannot, in exercise of its power under Art. 142, pass an order totally contrary to law \u2013 If such power could be used in a food adulteration case to impose a sentence lower than the minimum prescribed, then even in cases of murder and rape, this Court applying the same principles could impose a sentence less than the minimum \u2013 This, is not the purpose of Art.142 \u2013 The powers under Art.142 cannot be exercised in such a manner that they make a mockery of the law itself \u2013 Administration of justice \u2013 Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954."
