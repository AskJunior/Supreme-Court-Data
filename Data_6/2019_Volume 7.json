petitioner-Society contended that s.23(2) of the Act is ultra-vires the Constitution as it assumes the guiltof the alleged accused even before his/her conviction by a competentcourt and hence violates the fundamental right guaranteed u/Art.21of the Constitution \u2013 Held: s.23 is not a stand alone section \u2013 It israther used in the enforcement of other provisions of the Act andviolations of s.23 are often accompanied by violations of provisionsof ss.4, 5, 6 and 18 of the Act \u2013 It provides for punishment for anymedical geneticist, gynecologist, registered medical practitioner ora

technical in nature gives the insight into the reasonsfor conducting ultra-sonography and incomplete Form \u2018F\u2019 raisesthe presumption of doubt against medical practitioner \u2013 Insofar asmaintaining of record is concerned, they have to maintained onlywhen the procedure or tests are conducted on pregnant woman orwhen patient may have been advised to use pre-conceptiondiagnostic tools to conceive a child \u2013 The scheme of the Act makesit evident that record keeping is meant to track/monitor and regulatethe use of technology that has potential of sex selection and sexdetermination \u2013 As the entries are mandatory and sine qua non forundertaking a test/procedure, the assertion that their fundamentalrights are being violated by not providing requisite information isnot germane and is without substance.Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnost ic Techniques(Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 \u2013 Proviso to s.4(3) \u2013Petitioner-society contended that s.4(3) should be read down \u2013 Held:By virtue of the proviso to s. 4(3), a person conductingultrasonography on a pregnant woman, is required to keep completerecord of the same in the prescribed manner and any deficiency orinaccuracy in the same amounts to contravention of s.5 or s.6 ofthe Act, unless the contrary is proved by the person conducting thesaid ultrasonography \u2013 The aforementioned proviso to s.4(3) reflectsthe importance of records in such cases, as they are often the only source to ensure that an establishment is not engaged in sexdetermination\u2013 Thus, there is no substance in the contention thatprovision of s.4(3) be read down.Pre-conception and Pre-natal Diagnost ic Techniques(Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 \u2013 s.30 \u2013 Pre-conceptionand Pre-natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection)Rules, 1996 \u2013 rr.11 and 12 \u2013 Indian Medical Council (Professionalconduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002 \u2013 Petitioner-societycontended that the action of seizure of ultra-sonography machineand sealing the premises by the competent authority cannot be saidto be appropriate \u2013 Held: s. 30 of the Act enumerates the power ofsearch and seizure and rr. 11 & 12 of the Rules provide for thepower of the Appropriate Authority to seal equipment, inspectpremises and conduct search and seizure \u2013 It is settled propositionthat when offence is found to be committed, there can be seizureand sealing of the premises and equipment during trial as no licensecan be given to go on committing the offence \u2013 Such provisions ofseizure/sealing, pending trial are to be found invariably in variouspenal legislations \u2013 The impugned provisions contained in the Actconstitute reasonable restrictions to carry on any profession whichcannot be said to be violative of Right to Equality enshrined u/Art.14 or right to practise any profession u/Art. 19(1)(g) \u2013 Consideringthe Fundamental Duties u/Art. 51A(e) and considering that femalefoeticide is most inhumane act and results in reduction in sex ratio,such provisions cannot be said to be illegal and arbitrary in anymanner besides there are various safeguards provided in the Act toprevent arbitrary actions \u2013 Thus, contention of the petitionerrejected \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.19(1)(g), 14, 51A(e)."

Penal Code, 1860: s.195(1)(b) \u2013 Prosecution under \u2013 Held: Under s.340, the prosecution is to be launched only if it is expedient in the interest of justice and not in every case \u2013 Before proceeding to make a complaint regarding commission of an offence referred to in s.195(1)(b), the court must satisfy itself that \u201cit is expedient in the interest of justice\u201d \u2013 The language in s.340 Cr.P.C. shows that such a course will be adopted only if the interest of justice requires and not in every case \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.340."

Writ: Writ of habeas corpus \u2013 Maintainability of, in child custody matters \u2013 Held: Writ of habeas corpus is a prerogative process for securing the liberty of the subject by affording an effective means of immediate release from an illegal or improper detention \u2013 Writ extends its influence to restore the custody of a minor to his guardian when wrongfully deprived of it \u2013 In child custody matters, the power of the High Court in granting the writ habeas corpus is qualified only in cases where the detention of a minor by a person who is not entitled to his legal custody \u2013 In such matters, the ordinary remedy lies only under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act or the Guardians and Wards Act as the case may be \u2013 It is only in exceptional cases, the rights of the parties to the custody of the minor would be determined in exercise of extra\u0002ordinary jurisdiction on a petition for habeas corpus."

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.34 \u2013 Setting aside an arbitral award, in conflict with \u201cpublic policy of India\u201d\u2013 Law post Amendment Act, 2015 \u2013 Held: \u201cPublic policy of India\u201d, whether contained in s.34 or s.48 of the 1996 Act would now mean the \u201cfundamental policy of Indian law\u201d as explained in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders case i.e. the fundamental policy of Indian law would be relegated to the \u201cRenusagar\u201d understanding of this expression \u2013 Expansion of the phrase \u201cpublic policy of India\u201d, made in Western Geco case has been done away with \u2013 Western Geco as explained in paragraphs 28 and 29 of Associate Builders, would no longer obtain, as under the guise of interfering with an award on the ground that the arbitrator has not adopted a judicial approach, the Court\u2019s intervention would be on the merits of the award, which cannot be permitted post amendment \u2013 However, principles of natural justice, as contained in ss.18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the 1996 Act continue to be grounds of challenge of an award, as is contained in paragraph 30 of Associate Builders \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015. Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: Section 34, as amended, will apply only to s.34 applications that have been made to the Court on or after 23.10.2015, irrespective of the fact that the arbitration proceedings may have commenced prior to that date \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.34. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Amendment by way of clarification \u2013 Retrospective or prospective \u2013 Held: Amendment made in Explanations 1 and 2 to s.34(2)(b)(ii) have been made for the avoidance of any doubt \u2013 Even on principle, it is the substance of the amendment that is to be looked at rather than the form \u2013 Therefore, even in cases where, for avoidance of doubt, something is clarified by way of an amendment, such clarification cannot be retrospective if the earlier law has been changed substantively \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 Explanations 1 and 2 to s.34(2)(b)(ii). Words & expressions \u2013 \u201cPublic policy of India\u201d \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: Public policy of India is now constricted to mean firstly, that a domestic award is contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law, as understood in paragraphs 18 and 27 of Associate Builders case, or secondly, that such award is against basic notions of justice or morality as understood in paragraphs 36 to 39 of Associate Builders \u2013 Explanation 2 to s.34(2)(b)(ii) and Explanation 2 to s.48(2)(b)(ii) was added by the Amendment Act only so that Western Geco case, as understood in Associate Builders, and paragraphs 28 and 29 in particular, is now done away with \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 Explanation 2 to s.34(2)(b)(ii) & Explanation 2 to s.48(2)(b)(ii) \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.34(2A) \u2013\u201dPatent illegality\u201d \u2013 Held: Insofar as domestic awards made in India are concerned, an additional ground is now available u/sub-s.(2A), added to s.34 by the Amendment Act, 2015\u2013 There must be patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which refers to such illegality as goes to the root of the matter but which does not amount to mere erroneous application of the law \u2013 If an arbitrator is alleged to have wandered outside the contract and dealt with matters not allotted to him, this would be a jurisdictional error which could be corrected on the ground of \u201cpatent illegality\u201d, which would not apply to international commercial arbitrations that are decided under Part II of the 1996 Act \u2013 A decision which is perverse, as understood in paragraphs 31 and 32 of Associate Builders, while no longer being a ground for challenge under \u201cpublic policy of India\u201d, would certainly amount to a patent illegality appearing on the face of the award \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 ss.28(3), 34(2A) \u2013 Held: Change made in s.28(3) by the Amendment Act really follows what is stated in paragraphs 42.3 to 45 in Associate Builders case, namely, that the construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide, unless the arbitrator construes the contract in a manner that no fair-minded or reasonable person would; that the arbitrator\u2019s view is not even a possible view to take \u2013 Also, if the arbitrator wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits an error of jurisdiction \u2013 This ground of challenge will now fall within the new ground added u/s.34(2A) \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.34(2)(a)(iii) and ss.18, 24(3), 26 \u2013 Held: ss.18, 24(3) and 26 are important pointers to what is contained in the ground of challenge mentioned in s.34(2)(a)(iii) \u2013 Under s.34(2)(a)(iii), one of the grounds of challenge of an arbitral award is that a party is unable to present its case \u2013 Where materials are taken behind the back of the parties by the Tribunal, on which the parties have had no opportunity to comment, the ground u/s.34(2)(a)(iii) would be made out. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.34(2)(a)(iv) \u2013 \u201dsubmission to arbitration\u201d\u2013 Challenge to an arbitral award \u2013 Held: Where an arbitral tribunal has rendered an award which decides matters either beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement or beyond the disputes referred to the arbitral tribunal, the arbitral award could be said to have dealt with decisions on matters beyond the scope of submission to arbitration \u2013 To bring in by the backdoor grounds relatable to s.28(3) of the 1996 Act to be matters beyond the scope of submission to arbitration u/s.34(2)(a)(iv) would not be permissible as this ground must be construed narrowly and so construed, must refer only to matters which are beyond the arbitration agreement or beyond the reference to the arbitral tribunal. Words & expressions \u2013\u201dmost basic notions of \u2026 justice\u201d\u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: Expression\u201dmost basic notions of \u2026 justice\u201d finds mention in Explanation 1 to sub-clause (iii) to s.34(2)(b) \u2013 Here, what is referred to is, substantively or procedurally, some fundamental principle of justice which has been breached, and which shocks the conscience of the Court \u2013 Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 Explanation 1 to sub-clause (iii) to s.34(2)(b)."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 202 \u2013 Scope of enquiry \u2013 Held: The scope of enquiry under this section is extremely restricted only to finding out the truth or otherwise of the allegations made in the complaint in order to determine whether process should be issued or not u/s. 204 Cr.P.C. or whether the complaint should be dismissed by resorting to s.203 Cr.P.C. on the footing that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding on the basis of the statements of the complainant and of his witnesses, if any \u2013 At the stage of enquiry u/s. 202 Cr.P.C., the Magistrate is only concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the evidence in support of the averments in the complaint to satisfy himself that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Issuance of process \u2013 Held: To be summoned/to appear before the Criminal Court as an accused is a serious matter affecting one\u2019s dignity and reputation in the society \u2013 In taking recourse to such a serious matter in summoning the accused in a case filed on a complaint otherwise than on a police report, there has to be application of mind as to whether the allegations in the complaint constitute essential ingredients of the offence and whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s. 29 \u2013 Document \u2013 Held: The \u201cdocument\u201d as defined in s.29 IPC is a \u201cmoveable property\u201d within the meaning of s.22 IPC which can be the subject matter of theft \u2013 The information contained thereon in the documents would also fall within the purview of the \u201ccorporeal property\u201d and can be the subject matter of the theft. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Theft \u2013 Intention of the taker \u2013 Held: Intention is the gist of the offence \u2013 It is the intention of the taker which must determine whether taking or moving of a thing is theft \u2013 The intention to take \u201cdishonestly\u201d exists when the taker intends to cause wrongful loss to any other which amounts to theft \u2013 It is an essential ingredient of the offence of \u201ctheft\u201d that the movable property should have been \u201cmoved\u201d out of the possession of any person without his consent."

Committees \u2013 When not tribunal \u2013 Held: Before a body can be said to be a \u201ctribunal\u201d, it must be invested with the judicial power of the State to decide a lis arising before it, must be legally authorised to take evidence by statute/subordinate legislation or otherwise. Principles of natural justice \u2013 Revised Circular issued by RBI replacing the mechanism for identification of wilful defaulters as provided in the earlier Circular \u2013 In-house committees referred to in the Circular \u2013 Right of oral hearing before such committees, if any \u2013 Held: Given the scheme of the Revised Circular, it is difficult to state that oral hearing is mandatory \u2013 Natural justice is a flexible tool used in order that a person or authority arrives at a just result \u2013 Such result can be arrived at in many cases without oral hearing but on written representations given by parties, after considering which, a decision is then arrived at.

All claims and reliefs, which arise from a cause of action, must be comprehended in one single suit \u2013 On facts, at the time when the first suit was filed even though the second alienation could be challenged and it stemmed from one single cause of action and not two different causes of action, the mere fact that a different period of limitation is provided, cannot stand in the way of the bar under Order II, Rule 2 \u2013 At the time of filing of the first suit, late predecessor\u0002in-interest of the plaintiff, had also executed another sale deed which constituted the remaining portion of the land \u2013 Suits contained virtually identical averments in regard to both the transactions \u2013 In such circumstances, it was open to the plaintiff to seek relief in respect of the second sale executed by their predecessor-in-interest \u2013 On the same cause of action, the plaintiffs having omitted to sue in respect of the sale deed, the bar under Order II, Rule 2 would apply \u2013 Thus, the judgment of the High Court is set aside."

Constitution of India: Arts. 200 and 201 \u2013 Assent to the Bill \u2013 Reservation of the Bill( which led to Reservation Act, 2018) by the Governor for the consideration of the President \u2013 Power u/Art. 200 \u2013 Exercise of \u2013 Held: Once the Bill was reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the President, it was for the President to either grant or withhold assent to the Bill \u2013 President having assented to the Bill, the requirements of Art. 201 were fulfilled \u2013 Validity of the assent by the President is non-justiciable \u2013 State Government, was of the view that there was no necessity of reserving the Bill for the consideration of the President, since in its view, the Governor had not recorded a finding that it was unconstitutional, or fell afoul of existing central legislation on the subject or that it was beyond legislative competence or derogated from the fundamental rights \u2013 This objection of the State Government cannot cast doubt upon the grant of assent by the President \u2013 Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2018. Art. 16(4A) and (4B) \u2013 Ratna Prabha Committee report \u2013 Collection of data by State on adequacy of representation and impact on efficiency \u2013 Exercise of judicial power on propriety and sufficiency \u2013 Held: Court should recognize the circumspection with which judicial power must be exercised \u2013 Judicial review must traverse conventional categories by determining as to whether the Ratna Prabha Committee considered material which was irrelevant or extraneous or had drawn a conclusion which no reasonable body of persons could have adopted. Art. 16(4A) and (4B) \u2013 Ratna Prabha Committee report \u2013 Report, commissioned to collect information on cadre wise representation of SC and ST employees in all government departments and on backwardness of SCs and STs; and study the effect on the administration due to the promotion of SCs and STs \u2013 Report, whether constituted an adequate and appropriate basis to support the validity of the Reservation Act and its implementation \u2013 Held: Ratna Prabha Committee report is valid \u2013 After the decision in *B K Pavitra I, the Ratna Prabha Committee was correctly appointed to carry out the required exercise \u2013 Committee has not based its conclusions on any extraneous or irrelevant material \u2013 In adopting recourse to sampling methodologies, the Committee has not acted arbitrarily \u2013 The exercise cannot be invalidated only on the ground that data pertaining to a particular department or of some entities was not analysed \u2013 State analysed the data which is both relevant and representative, before drawing its conclusions \u2013 Even if there were some errors in data collection, that would not justify the invalidation of a law which the competent legislature was within its power to enact \u2013 Furthermore, there is no merit in the challenge to the Ratna Prabha Committee report on the ground that the collection of data was on the basis of groups A, B, C and D as opposed to cadres \u2013 Collection of data on the basis of groups A to D does not by its very nature exclude data pertaining to cadres \u2013 Since, the group includes posts in all the cadres in that group, it can logically be presumed that the State has collected quantifiable data on the representation of SCs and STs in promotional posts in the cadres as well \u2013 Karnataka Extension of Consequential Seniority to Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act, 2018. Art. 16(1) and (4) \u2013 Equality \u2013 Substantive versus formal equality \u2013 Constitutional content of \u2013 Held: For equality to be truly effective or substantive, the principle must recognise existing inequalities in society to overcome them \u2013 Reservations are not an exception to the rule of equality of opportunity, rather the true fulfilment of effective and substantive equality by accounting for the structural conditions into which people are born. Interpretation of the Constitution \u2013 Held: Constitution is a transformative document \u2013 Realization of its transformative potential rests ultimately in its ability to breathe life and meaning into its abstract concepts \u2013 Constitution was intended by its draftspersons to be a significant instrument of bringing about social change \u2013 Realisation of the transformative potential of the Constitution has been founded on the evolution of equality away from its formal underpinnings to its substantive potential. Art. 335 proviso \u2013 Claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to services and posts \u2013 Constitutional justification for efficiency in administration \u2013 Held: Under Art. 335 consideration of the claims of SCs and STs in making appointments to services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State is to be in a manner consistent with maintaining the efficiency of administration \u2013 Proviso to Art. 335 specifically protects provisions in favour of the SCs and STs for relaxing qualifying marks in an examination; lowering the standards of evaluation; or reservation in matters of promotion \u2013 Proviso recognises that special measures need to be adopted for considering the claims of SCs and STs in order to bring them to a level playing field \u2013 Proviso is not a qualification to the substantive part of Art. 335 but it embodies a substantive effort to realise substantive equality \u2013 Need to maintain the efficiency of administration cannot be construed as a fetter on adopting these special measures designed to uplift and protect the welfare of the SCs and STs. Art. 335 \u2013 Phrase \u201cefficiency of administration\u201d \u2013 Definition of \u2013 Held: Constitution does not define the phrase \u201cefficiency of administration\u201d \u2013 Art. 335 cannot be construed on an assumption that roster point promotees drawn from SCs and STs are not efficient or that efficiency is reduced by appointing them \u2013 Benchmark for the efficiency of administration is not the performance of a qualified open category candidate \u2013 Efficiency of administration in the affairs of the Union or of a State must be defined in an inclusive sense, where diverse segments of society find representation as a true aspiration of governance by and for the people \u2013 Inclusion together with the recognition of the plurality and diversity of the nation constitutes a valid constitutional basis for defining efficiency \u2013 Hence, while interpreting Art. 335, it is necessary to liberate the concept of efficiency from a one sided approach which ignores the need for and the positive effects of the inclusion of diverse segments of society on the efficiency of administration \u2013 Since inclusion is inseparable from a well governed society, there is, no antithesis between maintaining the efficiency of administration and considering the claims of the SCs and STs to appointments."
