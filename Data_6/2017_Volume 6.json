(R. 8anumathi, J.) c s.376(2)(g), Explanation l - Essential ingredients - Held: In order to establish an offence under s.376(2)(g) rlw Explanation l thereto, the prosecution must adduce evidence to indicate that more than one accused had acted in concert and in such an event, if F rape is committed by even one, all the accused are guilty, irrespective of the fact that only one or more of them had actually committed the act - s.376(2)(g} rlw Explanation l thus embodies a principle of joint liability. (R. 8anumathi, J) Sentence/Sentencing: G H Death sentence - Mitigating and aggravating circumstances - Held: In the instant case, the mitigating factors highlighted by the appellants pertain to the strata to which these accused belong, the aged parents, marital status and the young children and the suffering they would go through and the calamities they would face in caseof affirmation of sentence, their conduct while they are in custody and the reformative path they have chosen and their transformation and the possibility o.f reformation - The brutal, barbaric and diabolic nature of the crime is evincible fi\"om the acts committed by the accused persons, viz., the assault on the informant with iron rod and tearing off his clothes; assaulting the informantand the deceased with hands, kicks and iron rod and robbing them of their personal belongings like debit cards, ring, informant's shoes, etc.; attacking the deceased by forcibly disrobing her and committing violent sexual assault by all the appellants; their brutish behaviour in having anal sex with the deceased and forcing her to pe1jorm oral sex; injuries on the body of the deceased by way of bite marks and insertion of rod in her private parts that, inter alia, caused pe1joration of her intestine which caused sepsis and, ultimately, led to her death - The accused persons had found an object for enjoyment in her and, as is evident, they were obsessed with the singular purpose sans any feeling to ravish her as they liked, treat her as they felt and, the gross sadistic and beastly instinctual pleasures came to the forefi\"ont when they, ajler ravishing he1; thought it to be just a matter of routine to throw her alongwith her friend out of the bus and crush them - The casual manner with which she was treated and the devilish manner in which they played with her identity and dignity is hwnan(F inconceivable - The appetite for sex, the hunger for violence, the position of the empowered and the attitude of perversity are bound to shock the collective conscience which knows not what to do - The aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances brought on record - Therefore, the High Court correctly confirmed the death penalty - No inte1ference called for - Crime against 1vomen. 3 A B C \u2022 D E Death sentence - Rarest of rare cases - In the instant case, gruesome offences were committed with highest viciousness - Human lust was allowed to take such a demonic fonn - The accused may not be hardened criminals; but the cruel manner in which the gang-rape was committed in the moving bus; iron rod~ were inserted G in the private parts of the victim; and the coldness with which both the victims were thrown naked in cold winter night shocks the collective conscience of the society - The instant case clearly comes within the catego1y of 'rarest of rare case' where the question oany other punishment is 'unquestionably foreclosed\u00b7 - If the dreadfulness displayed by the accused in committing the gang-rape, unnatural sex, insertion of iron rod in the private parts of the victim does not fall in the 'rarest of rare categ01:v ', then one may wonder what else would fall in that category - Penal Code, I 860. (R. Banumathi, J.) Mitigating and aggravating circumstances - Question of awarding sentence is a matter of discretion and has to be exercised on consideration of circumstances aggravating or mitigating in the individual cases - Protection of society and deterring the criminal is the avowed object of law - While determining sentence in heinous crimes, courts ought to weigh its impact on the society and impose adequate sentence considering the collective conscience or society:~ c1y for justice - While considering the imposition of appropriate punishment, courts should not only keep in vie1v the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim and the society at large. (R. Banumathi, J.) Delay/Laches - Delay in registration of FIR - Effect on prosecution case - Held: Delay in setting the law into motion by lodging of complaint in court or FIR at police station is normally viewed by courts with suspicion because there is possibility of concoction of evidence against an accused - Therefore, it becomes necessary for the prosecution to satisfactorily explain the delay - In the instant case, the victim was seriously injured and giving medical treatment to her was of prime importance - PW-1 himself was injured and was admitted to hospital and, therefore, no delay can be said to have been caused in registering the FIR. FIR - Non-mentioning of assailants in FIR - Effect on prosecution case - Held: It is settled law that FIR is not an encyclopedia of facts and it is not expected ji-om a victim to give details of the incident either in the FIR or in the brief hist01y given to the doctors - It may be suj)lcient if the broad facts of the G prosecution case alone appear - It cannot be said that merely because the names of the accused persons were not mentioned in the FIR, it raises serious doubts about the prosecution case in the light of injuries on PW-I '.I\u00b7 person and the gruesome acts against the victim must have put him in a traumatic condition and it would H not have been possible for him to recall and narrate the entireincident to the police at one instance. 5 A Evidence: Related witness, testimony of - Evidentiary value - Held: The evidence of a witness is not to be disbelieved simply because he is a partisan witness or related to the prosecution - It is to be weighed whether he was present or not and whether he is telling the truth or not - In the instant case, when informant-PW-I was first examined, his friend (the prosecutrix) was critically injured and he was in a shockea mental condition - PW-1, in his deposition, clearly spoke about the occurrence and also corroborated his complaint - The evidence of PW-1 was unimpeachable in character and the roving cross-examination did not erode his credibility - The injuries found on the person of PW-I lent assurance to his testimony that he was present at the time of the occurrence along with the prosecutrix. B c Testimony ofprime witness - Allegation that testimony of PW- ! was not trustworthy as it was not believable that he did not try to D resist the assailants - Held: The accused persons were in group and were also armed with iron rods - PW-1 was held by them - It would not have been possible for PW-1 to resist the number of' accused persons and save the prosecutrix - The evidence of PW-I cannot he doubted on the ground that he had not inte1fered with the occurrence - The FIR, supplementary statements recorded under E s.164, CrPC and the evidence in court show that there was no justification or warrant to treat the version of the witness as inconsistent - The testimony of PW-I was placed reliance upon by both the courts and there is no reason to differ with the said view. Testimony of injured witness - Evidentimy value of- Held: Evidence of injured witness is entitled to greater weight and the testimony of such a witness is considered to be beyond reproach and reliable. Scientific evidence - DNA - Evidentim:i1 value of- Held: DNA report deserves to be accepted unless it is absolutely dented and for non-acceptance of the same, it is to be established that there had been no quality control or quality assurance - If the sampling is proper and if' there is no evidence as to tampering of samples, the DNA test report is to be accepted - Forensic science."

JOO/- per lime tree, but for pomegranate tree it remained same -,. Appeal by claimants seeking enhancement of compensation - Dismissed by the High Court on the ground of inordinate delay of 3671 days - Held: There may be omission on the part of the claimants lo adopt extra vigilance; but same need not be used as a ground to depict them with negligence or want of bona fide - In case of acquisition of lands of agriculturists, the courts ought to adopt a pragmatic approach to award just and reasonable compensation and not pedantic approach - Since the appellants/claimants are the agriculturists whose lands were acquired and when similar situated agriculturists were given a higher rate of compensation, no reason to decline the same to the appellants, merely on the ground of delay - More so, in a similar matter, the High Court had condoned the delay of 3386 days in filing the land acquisition appeal - Furthermore, award of compensation in relation to fruit bearing trees depends on facts and circumstances of each case - Appellant sought compensation of Rs.3, 0001- per pomegranate tree relying on judgment of this Court which cannot be made applicable to the instant case since the award of compensation in the said case was of 08. 03.1999, as opposed to instant award of 30.01.1992 - Period of about seven years is a considerable period to be taken note of while computing cost of planting and raising fruit bearing trees - It is obvious that seven years back a fruit bearing tree would have fetched lesser income than it would fetch now - On facts, appellants awarded compensationof Rs.1,5001- for each pomegranate tree - As regards lime trees, fresh limes are available throughout the year and have good market and the lime trees are earning income almost throughout the year - Compensation of Rs. 100/- per each lime tree enhanced to Rs.250/- - Said compensation is awarded along with all sta,tutory benefits - Howeve1; appellants not entitled to any interest during the period of delay of 3671 days."

'I' was absolutely illegal and there was conflict of interest since the Secreta1y s son and son-in-law were inducted as partners in the concerned firm; also there was revenue loss as the audit re1jort of the Accountant General is appreciated; the Secretary of the association could nut have been instrumental in unauthorised construction on the government land and in generating revenue therefrom; furthe1; there was serious concern about the nature of revenue generation utilisation and the fuss sustained - Therefore. the agreement between the association and Mis.
