Yadav wherein it was held that the rule of quota applicable at the stage of appointment/ recruitment will have no applicability at the time of confirmation; and that the High Court ought to have followed the judgment in S.S. Yadav case since that judgment was already before it when this case was decided by the High Court- Whereas in Paramjit Singh case, rules pertaining to officers of DSP cadre itself (i.e. the 1959 Rules) were in issue in B.S.Yadav case, some other Rules (i.e. 1963 Rules) came up for interpretation -Approach of the High Court in following the dicta laid down in Paramjit Singh - Justification - Held: Justified, as it pertained to the same Service and same Rules - That is the mandate of Art. 141 of the Constitution - Since \u00b7 8.
