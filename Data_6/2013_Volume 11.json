Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s. 100 - High Court framing substantial questions of law and while answering the same in favour of defendants, setting aside concurrent findings of both the courts below - Held: High Court has rightly come to the conclusion that substantial questions of law were to be answered in the negative, holding that since plaintiff-appellants have not produced any document of title in relation to suit property, grant of decree . in their favour is erroneous in. law - Substantial questions of law framed by High Court at the _time of admission of second appeal is based on law laid down by Supreme Court - Therefore, High Court was justified in recording cogent and  valid reasons to annul the concurrent findings of courts below and in holding that non-appreciation of pleadings and \u00b7 evidence on record by courts below rendered their finding on the contentious issues/points as perverse and arbitrary, and, therefore, the same have been rightly set aside by High Court c by answering the substantial questions of law in favour of defendants - There is, therefore, no reason to interfere with the judgment and decree passed by High Court.
