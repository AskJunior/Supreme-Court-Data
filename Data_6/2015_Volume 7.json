        "HeadNote": " Penal Code, 1860- s. 304 Part II read with s. 34 - Land dispute between parties - On the fateful day, appellant and his brother caught hold of PW3 and when PW 3's uncle tried to intervene, appellant inflicted injuries to uncle, who later succumbed to it- Conviction and sentence of both appellant and his brother u/s. 304 Part II rw s. 34 - However, High Court upheld conviction of the appellant, while acquitted his brother\u00b7 - On appeal, held: Evidence proved the appellant guilty for committing the offence - He was aggressor and had hit the deceased - Both ocular and documentary evidence proved that motive did exist prior to commission of the crime - Material evidence duly proved by the eyewitnesses could not be ignored - However, such was not the case of co- accused and thus, he was given the benefit of doubt- Having regard to the nature of injury caused by the appellant to the deceased and the manner in which it was caused and taking into account the cause of death-shock and hemorrhage, the courts below justified in bringing the case u/s. 304 Part II - Also the punishment of five years appears to be just and proper - Thus, conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant by the courts below upheld.
