Criminal jurisprudence: It is a well entrenched principle of criminal jurisprudence that a charge can be said to be proved only when there is certain and explicit evidence to warrant legal conviction and that no person can be held guilty on pure moral conviction \u2014 Howsoever grave the alleged offence may be, and otherwise stirring the conscience of any court, suspicion alone cannot take the place of legal proof \u2014 The well established cannon of criminal justice is \u201cfouler the crime higher the proof\u2019 \u2014 In unmistakable terms, it is the mandate of law that the prosecution in order to succeed in a criminal trial, has to prove the charge(s) beyond all reasonable doubt.
