Burden of proof - Lies on whom - Held: The burden of proving any form of ma/a fide lies on the shoulders of the one alleging it. "

D19) written in the handwriting of his wife and containing her signature - It appears from Ext. D19 that the deceased wrote the chit according to her free will saying that nobody was responsible for her death and that her F parents and family members had harassed her husband and she was taking the step as she was fed up with her fife because of the quarrels that were taking place - Evidence of DW1 (appellant) and Ext.D19 cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution story that the deceased was subjected to G harassment or cruelty in connection with demand of dowry - Since the prosecution was not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the. ingredient of harassment or cruelty, neither of the offences u!ss.498A and 3048, !PC has been made out by the prosecution - Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 - s.2."

RI u/s 304-B by courts below - Held: Trial court as well as High Court has accepted E the evidence of prosecution witnesses that there was demand of dowry - But, an examination of their evidence makes it evident that they have only made a bald statement that accused persons were not satisfied with the dowry and were asking the bride to bring the stated amount a sum of F Rs.50,0001- - Thus, on the base ofsuch sketchy evidence, it is difficult to concur with the finding that there was detnand of dowry by accused-husband and harassment pertained to such a demand ~ The conclusion on this score is based on certain a priori notions - However, it has come out in evidence G that there was ill-treatment by mother-in-law and husband - Bride was in her early twenties - She was turned out of matrimonial home on certain occasions - This aspect has been established beyond doubt - Considering the evidence of prosecution witnesses, it is a case where the bride was totally insensitively treated with cruelty and harassed because of which she put an end to her life. s.304-B, s.306 read with s.498-A - Held: Though charge has not been framed u/s 306 yet, it is evident that accused 8 were aware that they were facing a charge u/s 304B /PC which related not to administration of poison but to consumption of poison by deceased because of demand of dowry and harassment - It is major offence in comparison to s. 306 which C deals with abetment to suicide by a bride in the context of clause (a) of s. 498A - Thus, basic ingredients of offence uls 306 have been established by prosecution inasmuch as death has occurred within seven years in an abnormal circumstance and deceased was meted out with mental cruelty - Accordingly, conviction from one uls 304B is converted to that D uls 306 - As accused has spent almost five years in custody, sentence is limited to period already undergone - Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.313. CRIMINAL TRIAL: E Conducting of trial - Adjournments - Held: A criminal trial has its own gravity and sanctity -- Trial courts shall keep in mind the statutory provisions and their interpretation by Supreme Court -- They should not become mute spectators when a trial is being conducted by allowing the control to F counsel for parties - They are required to monitor - Besides, dispensation of criminal justice is not only a concern of the Bench but has to be the concern of the Bar as well - Administration of justice reflects its purity when the Bench and the Bar perform their duties with utmost sincerity - An advocate G cannot afford to bring any kind of disrespect to fairness of trial by taking recourse to subterfuges for procrastinating the same - In the instant case, trial was conducted in an extremely haphazard and piecemeal manner - Adjournments were granted on a mere asking - Cross-examination of witnesseswere deferred without recording any special reason and dates were given after a long gap - Court expresses its concern about the manner in which trial had been conducted - Administration of justice - Criminal justice - Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s. 309 - Advocates."

Regulation 27(1)(b)(c) and (d) - Rejection of request for F withdrawal of offer to acquire equity shares - Held: Rejection of request made by appellants for withdrawal from the public offer or exemption under Regulation 27(1)(d) cannot be said to be an order causing adverse civil consequences - Appellants had made an informed business decision - G Normally, the public offer once made can only be withdrawn in exceptional circumstances as indicated in Regulation 27(1) (b), (c) and (d) - These sub-clauses are exceptions to the general rule and, therefore, have to be construed very strictly -Clauses (b) and fc) are within the same genus ofimpossibility - Clause (d) also being an exception to the general rule would have to be construed in terms of clauses (b) and (c) - Clause (d) would not permit SEBI to accept the offer of withdrawal when it has become uneconomical for the acquirer to perform the public offer - The meaning of terms \"such circumstances\" from the realm of impossibility cannot be stretched to the realm of economic undesirability - Therefore, it cannot be said that the principle of ejusdem generis is not applicable for interpreting Regulation 27(1) (d) - SEBI as well as the SAT have correctly concluded that withdrawal of the open offer in the given set of circumstances is neither in the interest of investors nor development of the securities market - Interpretation of statues - Ejusdem generis - Maxim 'noscitur a sociis'. Regulation 27(1) - Order of SEB/ rejecting request for withdrawal - Plea of delay in passing the order - Held: The plea was not raised before SAT - It has been raised for the first time in the submissions made before Supreme Court - Since, it is a statutory appeal uls 15Z of the SEB/ Act, the plea cannot be permitted to be raised - Even on merits, there was no delay on the part of SEBI in approving the draft letter of offer - Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 - s. 15Z - Delay/Laches."

A B MOTOR VEHICLES ACT, 1988: s. 2(44) and 2(28) - Motor vehicle - 'Tractor', 'Dumper' - Hetd: Tractor is a motor vehicle in terms of definition u/ss C 2(28) and 2(44) - Thus, tractor is a motor vehicle as defined under the Act - Tractor which is used basically for agricultural purpose and a dumper used in the factory premises, can suitably be adapted for being used on the road, therefore, they will meet the requirement of definition of motor vehicle u/s 2(28) - The word \u00b7only' used in s. 2(28) clearly shows that the exemption is confined only to those kinds of vehicles which are exclusively being used in a factory or in any closed premises - Thus, a vehicle which is not adapted for use upon the road, is only to be excluded. s.2(28) - Motor vehicle - 'Jugaad' - Held: Within the meaning of s.2(28), any vehicle which is mechanically propelled and adapted for use on roads and does not fall within the exceptions provided therein, is a motor vehicle - As has been held by Allahabad High Court, 'Jugaad' is squarely covered under the definition of motor vehicles as specified uls 2(28), since it is mechanically propelled and adapted for use on road and, \u00b7 therefore, other relevant provisions of the Act/rules are applicable - Therefore, statutory authorities cannot escape from their duty to enforce the law and restrain the plying of 'Jugaad' - They must ensure that 'Jugaad' can be plied only after meeting the requirements of the Act - The same has become a menace to public safety as they are causing a very large number of accidents - 'Jugaads\"\u00b7i:ire notinsured and the owners of the 'Jugaad' generally do not have the financial capacity to pay compensation to persons who suffer disablement and to dependents of those who lose life - Thus, considering the gravity of the circumstances, statutory authorities must give strict adherence to the circular - However, B it is clarified that it is open to the statutory authorities to make exemptions by issuing a notification/circular specifically if such a vehicle is exclusively used for agricultural purposes but for that sufficient specifications have to be provided so that it cannot be used for commercial purposes - Government of c India (Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways) Circular dated 26. 7.2007, clarifying that 'Jugaad' is a vehicle u/s 2(28)."

Held: When an authority invested with the power purports to act on its own but in substance the power is exercised by external guidance or pressure, it would amount D to non-exercise of power, statutorily vested - In the instant case, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that Joint Registrar was acting under extraneous influence and under dictation - Order of supersession is not only in clear violation of second proviso to s.53(1), but also allegations raised in E show cause notice are deficiencies mostly relating to systems and procedures and are of general nature and not grave enough to overthrow a democratically elected Board of Directors - Board of Directors was superseded illegally, and, therefore, in view of proviso to s. 49(7 A)(i), they need to be .

Constitution of India, 1950: Art. 226 - Writ petition - Alternative remedy - Held: In the instant case, Division Bench of High Court has rightly exercised its jurisdiction under Art. 226 and the alternative remedy of appeal is no bar in exercising that jurisdiction, since the order passed by Joint Registrar was arbitrary and in clear violation of second proviso to s.53(1) of the Act - Madhya Pradesh Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 - s. 78.Co-operative Societies: A B c D E F Supersession of elected bodies - Held: Co-operative philosophy on society must rest on free universal association, democratically governed and conditioned by equity and personal liberty - Registrar/Joint Registrar, while exercising power of supersession has to form an opinion and that opinion G must be based on some objective criteria, which has nexus with final decision and he is bound to follow judicial precedents - The manner in which State Government took so much interest by spending huge public money pursuing the matter upto Supreme Court, that too without following bindingprecedents of High Court, depr,ecated - In vi~w of mushrooming of cases in various courts challenging orders of supersession of elected committees, general directions given - Precedent - Judicial deprecation."

Evidence - Conduct of the accused - Act of absconding - Effect - Held: Mere abscondance of an accused does not lead to a firm conclusion of his guilty mind - An innocent man may also abscond in order to evade arrest -In a given situation, such an action may be part of the natural conduct of the accused - Abscondance is in fact relevant evidence, but its evidentiary value depends upon the surrounding circumstances, and hence, the same must only be taken as a minor item in evidence for sustaining conviction.

A B c D E F G Criminal Trial - Adverse inference against the accused - When drawn - Held: Adverse inference can be drawn against the accused only and only if the incriminating material stands fully established, and the accused is not able to furnishany explanation for the same - However, the accused has the right to remain silent, as he cannot be forced to become a witness against himself."

        "HeadNote": " Penal Code, 1860 - s.302 r/w s.1208 - Murder - Criminal conspiracy -Dismembered parts of victim's body  recovered from a lake - Case based on circumstantial evidence against accused-appellant and other accused persons - Conviction of appellant - Justification - Held: Justified - Evidence on record clearly established that appellant had adequate reason to harbour animosity towards o the victim 'P', as he may well have been unable to tolerate the intimacy that 'P' had developed with appellant's wife - PW testified that appellant had threatened that in the event that he was able to lay his hands on 'P', he would chop him up into pieces - The motive thus stood proved - Victim last seen  with appellant (A-1) and A-2 - Recovery of chopper at the behest of appellant - Injuries revealed by post-mortem report established that dismemberment of parts of the body was possible by using a weapon like chopper\u00b7 - Victim's skull recovered on basis of disclosure statement of appellant -  Use of vehicle in the crime also stood proved - Appellant clearly involved in conspiracy \u00b7to eliminate 'P' - Prosecution proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - ss.161 and 164 - Statements u/s.161 and u/s.164 - Difference - Held:  Statements uls.161 can be used only for the purpose of contradiction - Statements u/s. 164, however, can be used for both corroboration and contradiction - Evidence Act, 1872 - s.157.  Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.164 - Object of- A Discussed. Criminal Law - Criminal conspiracy - Proof - Held:  Offence of criminal conspiracy can be proved, either by adducing circumstantial evidence, or by way of necessary implication - However, if the circumstantial evidence is incomplete or vague, it becomes necessary for the prosecution to provide adequate proof, by adducing substantive evidence in court - In order to constitute the offence of conspiracy, it is not necessary that the person  involved has knowledge of all the stages of action - Mere knowledge of the main object/purpose of conspiracy, would warrant the attraction of relevant penal provisions.   Evidence - Weapon of offence - Recovered at the behest of the accused - Blood stuck on the weapon - Failure  by serologist to detect origin of the blood due to dis-integration of the serum - Effect - Held: It does not mean that the blood stuck on the weapon of offence could not have been human blood at all - Sometimes it is possible, either because the stain is insufficient in itself, or due to haematological changes and plasmatic coagulation, that a serologist may fail to detect the origin of the blood in question - However, in such a case, unless the doubt is of a reasonable dimension, which a judicially conscientious mind may entertain with some objectivity, no benefit can be claimed by the accused in this F regard - Once recovery was made in pursuance of disclosure by the accused, the matching or non-matching of the blood group (s) lost its' significance.  Evidence Act, 1872 - s.3 - Appreciation of evidence - Jn civil case and in criminal case - Held: Basis for G appreciating evidence in a civil or criminal case is same - However, since in a criminal case, the life and liberty of a person is involved, by way of judicial interpretation, courts have created the requirement of a high degree of proof. Evidence Act, 1872 - s.9 - Test identification parade - Held.\u00b7 Conducting a test identification parade is meaningless if the witnesses know the accused, or if they have been shown his photographs, or if he has been exposed by the media to the public - In the instant case, just after the incident took  place, the main accused being a highly ranked police official, wide publicity was given to the same by the media - Moreover, the witnesses made it clear that they were acquainted with the appellant - In such fact-situation, holding/ non-holding of Test Identification Parade lost its significance.   Evidence Act, 1872 - s.134 - Evidence of witness - Appreciation of - Held: It is not the number of witnesses, but the quality of their evidence which is important - Evidence must be weighed and not counted.
