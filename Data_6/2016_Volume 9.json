Constitution of India: Arts. 14, 19(1)(g) and 19(6) - Constitutional validity of Telecom Consumers Protection (Ninth Amendment) Regulations, 2015 - Held: In order to pass Constitutional muster u/Art.14, the Regulation should not be manifestly arbitrary - So far as Art.19(1)(g) is concerned, u!Art. 19(6), the State has to conform to two separate and independent tests i.e. test of 'reasonable restriction' and test of 'public interest' - The test of reasonable restriction is distinct from the test of the law being in general public interest - In the present casij though the Regulation might have been brought in the interest of general public, it is manifestly arbitrary and therefore violative of Art. 14 and is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the service providers granted u/Art. l 9(1)(g) and the same has been framed without intelligent care and deliberation. Arts.19(l)(g) and 19(6) - A proper balance between the freedoms guaranteed u/Art. 19(1)(g) and the control permitted u/Art. 19(6) must be struck in all cases before the impugned law can be B said to be a reasonable restriction in the public interest.

Crime against women: Rape victim - Proof of offence - Held: The testimony of a victim in cases of sexual offences is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of a statement, the courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of the victim of a sexual assault alone to convict the accused - The victim of rape is not an accomplice and her evidence can be acted upon without corroboration - She stands at a higher pedestal than an injured witness does - It is only when the court finds it difficult to accept her version, it may seek corroboration from some evidence which lends assurance to her version - Penal Code, 1860.

The circular adverted to the provisions of Rule I 0 of the Jammu and Kashmir Government Employees (Conduct) Rules, 1971 which prohibited a government servant from taking up any assignment without the permission of the competent authority. The HighCourt disposed of the writ petition by setting aside the circular. In the present appeal, the State contended that it was not aggrieved by the directions of the High Court in their application to teachers, insofar as the circular dated 11 August 2005 was set aside. The grievance of the State was that the High Court issued a blanket direction erroneously on the basis that the circular of 11 August 2005 also covered the services of government doctors."

Waiver of provision of contract if any element of public interest is involved - Held: Such waiver will not be given effect to if it is contrary to such public interest - If there is any element of public interest involved, the court steps in to thwart any waiver which may be contrary to such public interest - Judicial review - Electricity Act, 2003. Contract Act, 1872: s.63 -Applicability of- Held: If on facts there is a waiver of a provision of the PPA by one of the parties to the PPA, then s.63 of the Contract Act will operate in order to give effect to such waiver - Waiver."
