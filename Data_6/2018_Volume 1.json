        "HeadNote": "Slum Dwellers:Rehabilitation of slum dwellers \u2013 800 slum dwellers in Mumbai \u2013 Relief of rehabilitation \u2013 Slum dwellers, who are also owners of the land, formed a society \u2013 Agreement between the society and appellant-developer to develop the slums and rehabilitate the slum dwellers in proper accommodation in the year 1986 \u2013 Thereafter, various agreements between the Society and developer \u2013 Developer to obtain consent of 70% slum dwellers in terms of amended DCR \u2013 However, the developer not developing project as per the agreement \u2013 Society entered into an agreement with respondent no. 4, which was subsequently terminated and appellant again appointed as the developer \u2013 Dispute between the appellant and respondent no. 4 \u2013 Matter before Supreme Court, wherein former judge of Supreme Court appointed to verify the factum of consentum of the eligible slum dwellers \u2013 Report to the effect that both the developers failed to show that they had obtained 70% consent \u2013 Held: It is our duty to ensure that these owners who also happen to be slum dwellers do not live in sub-human conditions for eternity \u2013 Appellant delayed the project, and respondent no. 4 obtained the consent of society members by holding out a false promise of a larger flat \u2013 Thus, both the contesting developers not entitled to any relief \u2013 800 slum dwellers, in addition to the flats, to be given compensation for the land owned by them \u2013 In exercise of power u/Art. 142, directions issued to Slum Redevelopment Authority-SRA to invite letters from renowned builders/developers, for rehabilitation of all eligible occupiers/slum dwellers within the stipulated period \u2013 Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971 \u2013 Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay, 1991 \u2013 Development Control Regulations, 1997 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 142.Rehabilitation of 800 slum dwellers \u2013 Various agreement between the slum dwellers and appellant-developer to develop the slums and rehabilitate the slum dwellers \u2013 In terms of amended DCR, the developer to obtain consent of 70% slum dwellers \u2013 However, project not developed as per the agreement \u2013 Dispute between the appellant and respondent no. 4-new developer \u2013 Matter before Supreme Court, wherein former judge of Supreme Court appointed to verify the consent of the slum dwellers in praesenti \u2013 Scope, ambit and effect of the said order\u2013 Held: Intention of the Court, will have to be deduced from the entire order \u2013 Phrase \u201cthere should be appropriate verification of the consent of the eligible slum dwellers in praesenti\u201d cannot be read in isolation \u2013 It has to be read in the context of the contention of the contesting parties that each one of them had the consent of more than 70% of the slum dwellers \u2013 This Court was not oblivious of the requirements of the Slum Act though may not have explicitly mentioned 70% in its order \u2013 It is clear that the judge had understood that he was to ascertain whether 70% of the eligible slum dwellers are in favour of the redevelopment scheme signed with the appellant or with respondent no. 4 \u2013 Holistic reading of the order admits of no other meaning \u2013 Admittedly, neither the appellant nor respondent no. 4 received 70% support of slum dwellers, as such, the said order cannot be taken to its logical conclusion.Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971: s.13(2) \u2013 Power of Competent Authority to redevelop clearance area \u2013 Held: Under s.13(2), the Slum Redevelopment Authority- SRA has the authority to take action and hand over the development of land to some other recognized agency under three circumstances- when there is contravention of the plans duly approved; when there is contravention of any restriction or condition imposed under sub- section 10 of s. 12; and when the development has not taken place within time, if any, specified \u2013 On facts, slum dwellers are virtually the owners of the land as members of the owner Society, the SRA had the power u/s. 13(2) to issue the order of setting aside the appointment of the appellant as developer. s.3A(3)(c) and (d) \u2013 Slum Redevelopment Authority-SRA \u2013 Power to remove the developer \u2013 Held: Since SRA issued the letter of intent, it necessarily has the power to cancel the same \u2013 In terms of clause (c) and (d) of sub-section (3) of s.3A, SRA not only has the power, but it is duty bound to get the slum rehabilitation scheme implemented and to do all such other acts and things necessary for achieving the object of rehabilitation of slums \u2013 On facts, SRA was faced with a situation where the slum dwellers were suffering for more than 25 years, thus, action by SRA to remove the developer for the unjustified delay totally justified \u2013 Developer could not have carried out the development work on the basis of its agreement with the Society \u2013 It needed permission of SRA \u2013 Thus, SRA can revoke such permission. s.13(2) \u2013 Notice u/s.13(2) \u2013 Issue of 70% consent, if raised \u2013 Held: When a notice is issued to a party, it must be clear and unambiguous as to what are the allegations it must meet \u2013 No allegation in the notice that right to develop granted in favour of the developer was liable to be revoked because it had not obtained consent of 70% of the slum dwellers but was confined to the issue of delay \u2013 Reference to Regulation 33(10) also did not specifically raise the issue of 70% consent.Development Control Regulations of 1991:70% consent of the slum dwellers, if mandatory \u2013 Held: Development Control Regulations of 1991 makes it absolutely clear that at least 70% of the slum dwellers/occupiers were to form a Society for the purpose of slum re-development scheme \u2013 Under the amended DCR of 1997, the developer/owner was required to enter into agreements with 70% of the slum dwellers to take up the slum rehabilitation scheme for consideration \u2013 Figure remains at 70% \u2013 Even if the remaining minority slum dwellers do not agree to be part of the scheme, the owner/developer is duty bound to make adequate arrangements for their rehabilitation and they can join the scheme, and can take benefit even at any later stage \u2013 Thus, 70% consent of the occupiers is mandatory \u2013 On facts, developer having applied for migration to new Scheme, had to obtain consent of 70% of the slum dwellers \u2013 Stand of the developer that it was not required to submit agreements with 70% slum dwellers, not legally tenable \u2013 Agreements with 70% slum dwellers should have been provided within a reasonable time and, though almost 20 years have elapsed since the second letter of intent was granted in favour of developer, it has till date failed to submit agreements \u2013 Development Control Regulations of 1997.Rehabilitation of slum dwellers \u2013 Whether developer delayed the construction of the scheme \u2013 Entitlement to relief \u2013 Held: Developer never earnestly pursued the authorities for approval of the plans because it did not have consent/agreements of 70% slum dwellers \u2013 It sought waiver of the requirement of obtaining 70% consent from the slum dwellers \u2013 Furthermore, only a portion of plot was covered by the CRZ Notification and the developer not prevented from raising construction on that portion of the land which was not affected by the CRZ Notification \u2013 Finding given by SRA that developer was responsible for the delay, based on appreciation of material on record and cannot said to be perverse \u2013 Though there may have been a few stop orders and a few occasions when the developer may not have been able to raise the construction but, by and large, developer was itself guilty of delaying the construction for no reason \u2013 Thus, developer rightly held responsible for the delay in implementation of the rehabilitation scheme.Rehabilitation of slum dwellers \u2013 Developer entered into rehabilitation scheme for slum dwellers \u2013 Inordinate delay in completion of the project \u2013 Developer, if entitled to continue with the Scheme \u2013 Held: Developer not entitled to continue with the rehabilitation Scheme \u2013 Developer cannot take the benefit of technical points to defeat the rights of the slum dwellers \u2013 On facts, both equity and law against the developer \u2013 Slum dwellers dealt in a highly inequitable manner \u2013 Law and the conditions of the letter of intent and various letters issued by SRA clearly required the developer to produce agreements with at least 70% of the slum dwellers \u2013 However, developer failed to do so \u2013 Developers as a legal entity was treating the slum dwellers only as a means of making money, thus, not entitled to any relief.Rehabilitation Scheme \u2013 Cancellation of slum rehabilitation agreement in favour of appellant-developers \u2013 Entitlement of respondent no.4(new developer) to continue with the rehabilitation Scheme \u2013 Held: Respondent no. 4 had misled the members of the Society in entering into an agreement with it by holding out a false promise that they would be given much larger flats \u2013 Respondent no.4 legally not entitled to make this offer \u2013 Also respondent no. 4 failed to get the consent of 70% slum dwellers and Society had terminated its agreement with the respondent no. 4 \u2013 Thus, consent having been obtained by misrepresentation of facts being no consent, respondent no. 4 not entitled to continue with the project and not entitled to any relief.Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 142 and 136 \u2013 Order of this Court requesting former judge of this Court to verify the consent of the slum dwellers in praesenti \u2013 Held: Court was aware that the slum dwellers were suffering due to the long protracted litigation and was moved by the pathetic condition in which most of the slum dwellers continued to reside \u2013 Court felt the need to find an innovative solution \u2013 Thus, the order fell within the ambit of Art. 142 to do complete justice between the parties.Judicial propriety \u2013 Requirement \u2013 Judicial propriety and discipline requires that a Coordinate Bench must respect the order of an earlier Bench \u2013 Even a larger Bench should not brush aside the order passed by an earlier Bench even if it be a smaller Bench unless the order is in issue before the larger Bench.Judgment/Order \u2013 Interpretation \u2013 Held: Judicial order or judgment has to be read as a whole and a single line or phrase cannot be read out of context \u2013 Judgment is not to be interpreted like a statute.Tender \u2013 Bid \u2013 Competitive bidding \u2013 Rehabilitation scheme of slum dwellers by developers \u2013 Inter se bidding between the builders \u2013 Held: High Court rightly held that consent once given by the slum dwellers should not be permitted to be withdrawn and there should be no inter se bidding between the builders \u2013 Competitive bidding can lead to a very unholy practice of developers trying to buy out the slum dwellers, which is also not in the interest of the rehabilitation scheme."

Ajmera case to the instant case, by cumulative analysis of the reversal transactions, quantity, time and significant variation of prices, without major variation in the underlying price of the securities indicate that the respondent\u2019s trades are not genuine and had only misleading appearance of trading in the securities market, without intending to transfer beneficial ownership.

Securities and Exchange Board of India (Stock Brokers and Sub-brokers) Regulations, 1992: Regns. 7A, (2), (3), (4) \u2013 Fictitious transactions creating illegal synchronization \u2013 Allegation of SEBI was that the traders and brokers at NSE were buying and selling almost equal quantities of contracts within the day and that such buy/sell orders were synchronized \u2013 Held: Considering the reversal transactions, quantity, price and time and sale, parties being persistent in number of such trade transactions with huge price variations, it will be too naive to hold that the transactions are through screen-based trading and hence anonymous \u2013 Such conclusion would be over-looking the prior meeting of minds involving synchronization of buy and sell order and not negotiated deals as per the board\u2019s circular \u2013 The impugned transactions are manipulative/deceptive device to create a desired loss and/or profit \u2013 Such synchronized trading is violative of transparent norms of trading in securities \u2013 If the findings of SAT are to be sustained, it would have serious repercussions undermining the integrity of the market and the impugned order of SAT is liable to be set aside \u2013 On this additional reasonings also, conclusion allowing the appeal preferred by SEBI against the traders is upheld \u2013 The conclusion dismissing the appeal preferred by the SEBI against the brokers is also upheld \u2013 SEBI Act, 1992 \u2013 ss.12A, 15HA. (Banumathi, J.) Stock Exchange: Need for comprehensive legal framework governing the securities market \u2013 As the market grows, ingenuous means of manipulation are also employed \u2013 In such a scenario, it is essential that SEBI keeps up with changing times and develops principles for good governance in the stock market which ensure free and fair trading \u2013 The observations made in Kishore R. Ajmera and Kanaiyalal Patel regarding need for more comprehensive legal framework governing the securities market, reiterated \u2013 SEBI Act, 1992. (Kurian Joseph, J.) Stock Exchange: Circumstances under which synchronized trade become illegal \u2013 Held: A synchronized transaction will become illegal or violative of the Regulations if it is executed with a view to manipulate the market or if it results in circular trading or is dubious in nature and with a view to manipulate the price or volume of the scrip or with some ulterior purpose. (Banumathi, J.) Stock Exchange: Manipulation of market \u2013 If the factum of manipulation is established, it will necessarily follow that the investors in the market have been induced to buy or sell and that no further proof in this regard is required \u2013 The market is so widespread that it may not be humanly possible for the Board to track the persons who were actually induced to buy or sell securities as a result of manipulation and the Board cannot be imposed with a burden which is impossible to be discharged. (Banumathi, J.) Stock Exchange: Prevention of market abuse \u2013 The smooth operation of the securities market and its healthy growth and development depends upon large extent on the quality and integrity of the market \u2013 Unfair trade practices affect the integrity and efficiency of the securities market and the confidence of the investors \u2013 Prevention of market abuse and preservation of market integrity are the hallmark of securities law. (Banumathi, J.) Stock Exchange: Role of SEBI \u2013 Object of SEBI Act \u2013 Held: The object of the SEBI Act is to protect the interest of the investors in securities and to promote the development and to regulate the securities market so as to promote orderly, healthy growth of securities market and to promote investor\u2019s protection \u2013 In order to protect the interests of the investors and the integrity of the markets, as a regulator, SEBI has to make the market place efficient and clean, wherein all the participants play their role diligently and professionally within the four corners of the system, without there being any scope for market abuse \u2013 Where certain unscrupulous elements are trying to manipulate the market to serve their own interest, it becomes imperative on the part of SEBI to intervene and to curb further mischief and to take necessary action to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the securities market. (Banumathi, J.) Evidence: In the quasi-judicial proceeding before SEBI, the standard of proof is preponderance of probability \u2013 Stock Exchange. (Banumathi, J.)

Constitution of India: Arts. 154 & 166 \u2013 State Government as defined u/s. 3 (60) of General Clauses Act means the Governor \u2013 All the executive powers are vested in Governor and he exercises such power either directly or through officers subordinate to him \u2013 Except the discretionary functions, the Governor does not exercise any executive functions individually \u2013 When a Minister takes an action according to the Rules of Business, it is both in substance and form, the action of the Governor \u2013 General Clauses Act, 1897 \u2013 s. 3(60). Principles of Doctrine of Pith and Substance: In the event any overlapping is found in two entries of Seventh Schedule or two legislations, it is the duty of the Court to find out its true intent and purpose and to examine the particular legislation in its pith and substance \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 VII Schedule.
