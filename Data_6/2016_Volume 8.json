Increase in the number of trips or vehicles which were being run under the existing exempted permit under a Scheme will amount to grant of a new permit to operate one more Stage Carriage which is not permissible under s.68FF.

A Evidence Act, 1872: s. 6 - Rationale behind - Held: It is the spontaneity and immediacy of the statement in question which rules out any time for concoction - For a statement to be admissible u/ s.6, it must be contemporaneous with the acts which constitute the offence or at least immediately thereafter - Penal Code, 1860 - s.302."

Pursuant to a report in a newspaper regarding breach at security at Sanganer Airport, Jaipur, Rajasthan High Court took suo moto cognizance of the report and a public interest petition was registered. During pendency of the petition, by a Circular dated 1.5.2002 issued by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security exempted certain categories of VVIPsNIPs from pre-embarkation security checks at civil airports in the country. Thereupon Registrar General of the Rajasthan High Court requested the Ministry concerned to exempt the Chief Justice of the High Court from pre-embarkation security checks. The Ministry declined to accede to the request. However, subsequently the Chief Justices of the High Courts were also included in the list of exempted persons. Thereafter, the High Cowi disposed of the petition directing inclusion of the Chief Justices and Judges of High Court in the list of persons exempted from pre-embarkation security checks. The High Court also formulated certain suggestions for formulating a National Security Pol icy and further directed the Government to consider it. Hence the present appeal. In the Transfer Petition (wherein transfer of Special Appeal before High Court was sought) also High Court while issuing notice to Bureau of Civil Aviation Security, made certain observations which were unrelated to the issue involved.

Principle of sentencing - Held: The appellate court cannot impose a sentence beyond the competence of the trial court - If the D trial court has no jurisdiction to impose a particular sentence, the High Court as a \"Court of error\" cannot pass a different harsher sentence. Sentencing in multiple offences - Concurrent or consecutive - In the instant case, trial court imposed life sentence and directed E all the sentences to run concurrent - High Court declined to enhance the sentence from imprisonment for life to death, but imposed a fixed term sentence - Whether a person sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life when visited with the 'term sentence' should suffer them consecutively or concurrently - Held: High Court did F not direct that the sentence u/ss.201/34 !PC shall run first and, thereafter, the fixed term sentence will commence - As the High Court has not done it, it is held inappropriate in the appeal preferred by the appellants to do so - Therefore, sentence imposed for the offence punishable ulss. 201/34 !PC to run concurrently with the sentence imposed for other offences by the High Court \"\"\"' Penal G Code, 1860 - ss  .201/34.Fixed term sentence - lmposition of - Honour killing - Nitish Katara case - High Court imposed a fixed term sentence i.e. 25 years for offence uls.302 !PC -Appellant's plea that the court can either impose sentence of imprisonment for life or sentence of death but it is not permissible to impose any other fixed term sentence - Held: The circumstantial evidence by which the crime was established, clearly led to one singular conclusion that the anger of the accused persons on the involvement of the sister with the deceased, was the only motive behind crime - Crime was committed in planned and cold blooded manner with a motive that emanated from unwarranted superiority based on caste feeling that blinded the thought of choice available to a sister - The factum of \"honour killing\" was a seminal ground for imposing the fixed term sentence of twenty-five years for the offences under ss. 302/34 IPC on the two accused persons, who though highly educated had not cultivated the ability to abandon the depricable feelings and attitude prevailing for centuries - Even after murdering the victim-deceased, the accused displayed their vengeance by destroying the body of the deceased which demonstrated the criminal tendency for they had neither respect for human life nor any concern for the dignity of a dead person - The brutality displayed by accused persons clearly exposed depraved state of mind - Imposition of fixed term on appellants cannot be found fault with.

Evidence: Dying declaration made to magistrate - Evidentiary value, discussedCode o.f Criminal Procedure, 197 3: s.378 - Appeal against order of acquittal - Scope of interference - Held: The appellate court is within its power to reappreciate or review the evidenceon which the acquittal is based - On reconsideration of the evidence A on record, if the appellate court finds the verdict of acquittal to be perverse or against the settled position of law, it is duly empowered to set aside the same - On the other hand, if the trial court had appreciated the evidence in right perspective and recorded the findings which are plausible and the view of the trial court does B not suffer from perversity, simply because the appellate court comes to a different conclusion on the appreciation of the evidence on record, it will not substitute its findings to that of findings recorded by the trial court - All precautions were taken by concerned authorities before and while recording her statement - After the completion of her statement, the Doctor made an endorsement to c the effect that the deceased remained fit during the recording of her statement and it is only thereafter the Magistrate (PW-11) appended his signature categorically stating that the statement recorded by him was true version of what the deceased had spoken and he had stated in unambiguous terms that she was fit to make D statement and remained fit till her statement was recorded.
