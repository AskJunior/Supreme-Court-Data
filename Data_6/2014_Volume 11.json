Commissioner, Devasthanam Department - The Court, however, dismissed the petition challenging the appointment of the Committee, as infructuous - Held: The Act is a self- contained Act providing appropriate mechanism - It clearly demonstrates the power and jurisdiction of the Assistant Commissioner in deciding the issues pertaining to public trust and particularly the issues raised in the present cases - High Court rightly relegated the issues to be decided by the statutory authority - The Assistant Commissioner was empowered under the Act to adjudicate the issues involved . - The appellant having approached the statutory authority has availed the alternative remedy available under the Act and hence cannot be permitted to avail two remedies simultaneously by approaching the Supreme Court - The appellants also cannot be said to be aggrieved by dismissal of the petition as infructuous.
