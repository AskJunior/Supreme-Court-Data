Highway (NH1) project - Contract between appellant- company and NHAI to construct certain portion of Highway on built, operate, trade (BOT) mode- Investment to be made by appellant by income generated from toll collection - In other writ petitions the issue of shifting of Toll Plaza adjudicated and attained finality- Matter again agitated and, while deciding continuance or otherwise of an interim order in a challenge to show cause notice, High Court in effect cancelling the agreement and saddling the appellant- contractor and its director with huge amounts of fine - Held: When Division Bench of High Court had already settled the dispute by a speaking judgment permitting the shifting of Toll \u00b7 Plaza, no legal authority was left with the Chairman, NHAI to issue a letter questioning the shifting - High Court also by impugned order, ignored the fact that controversy regarding shifting of Toll Plaza although had been set at rest by a judicial verdict of High Court, NHAI still insisted that it cannot permit the shifting when its I.E. (Independent Engineer) had earlier approved of the same and accepted by NHAI in view of specific clause in the agreement to that effect- High Court has further failed to visualise that the matter with which it was seized was limited to the question as to whether the order by which the show cause notice issued by the NHAI to appellant concessionaire-company was ordered to be kept in abeyance was fit to be vacated or not and went into the question whether . the appellant-company was fit to continue with~ project which had been handed over to it by NHAI by virtue ofa valid agreement executed between the parties, primarily the ground of delay without really entering into the cause of delay B and considering the plea at whose instance the contractual/ obligations had been violated- Impugned directions of High Court are set aside, and appellant is permitted to restore the construction of the balance stretch/area of Highway project- \u00b7 . NHAI is directed to permit the appellant to shift the Toll Plaza \u00b7 as indicated in judgment - Directions .given to appellant to \u00b7 complete entire construction of Highway and report the . progress to NHAI. Res judicata: Constructive res-judicata - Issue of shifting Toll Plaza decided by single Judge of High Court and decision affirmed in Letters Patent appeal - Matter attained finality \u00b7:.. Issue raised again - Held: A question or an issue which has been \u00b7 raised earlier before High Court, adjudicated and on which a final judgment/order was delivered, cannot be allowed to be raised for the second time as that would be clearly barred by \"the principle of constructive res judicata - Therefore, the issue of shifting of Toll Plaza which finally was dismissed was not permissible to be referred for arbitration once on the judicial side permission to shift the Toll Plaza was permitted  by High Court-Arbitration. Contract: Terms of contract- Held: In case of statutory contract, the terms of the statute prevail over the terms of the contract  - But, once the contract is signed by the contracting parties, obviously the contract having assumed the legal authority of a concluded contract would govern the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties who have signed it and thereafter it would be binding on the contracting parties "

Suit: Suit claiming title to suit properly and for declaration - Plaintiff's case that order of Consolidation Officer was obtained by fraud- Held: Order of Consolidation Officer was obtained on the basis offraud by defendants- Consolidation Officer has also committed fraud on appellant, by accepting F withdrawal of his objection and not going into the issue whether he is the rightful heir; with a right in half-share of suit properly - Suit was not barred by s.331 of U.P Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act nor u/s 49 of Consolidation of Hoidings Act as it was a suit for possession based on title G involving question of 'sonship', which was not within the jurisdiction of authorities under the two Acts - Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act, 1950- s.331 - Uttar Pradesh Consolidation of Holdings Act 1953 - s. 49 - Jurisdiction - Fraud.

        "HeadNote": " Representation of the People Act, 1951: s. 10A -  Election expenses - Power of Election Commission to hold an enquiry to ascertain the correctness or otherwise of the election expenses incurred by a returned candidate for the purpose of passing the order of disqualification - Held: Election Commission has got every 0 jurisdiction to enquire into the complaint made before it as regards the incorrect and untrue statement of accounts of election expenses lodged by the candidate - After such enquiry, as he thinks fit, on being satisfied that no justification was shown for the failure to lodge the account, can pass an E order of disqualification as provided u/s.10A for a period of three years from the date of the order and publish such order in the official gazette - While discharging such onerous responsibility, every care should be taken by Election Commission to ensure that no prejudice is caused to the contesting candidate - Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. s. 10 A - Enquiry by Election Commission - Relevance of - Held: Requirement of an enquiry to be made by the Election Commission at the instance of the President of the country under Article 103 in the case of Members of G Parliament and under Article 192 by the Governor of the State in the case of Member of Legislative Assembly of the State, fortifies conclusion that even the President of the country and the Governor of a State can rely upon the report of the Election Commission based on an enquiry before taking a decision under Article 103(2) and under Article 192(2) of the Constitution - Therefore, to call the Election Commission's responsibility before passing an order u/s.10A only to see the form and not substance as canvassed by the appellant' B is a proposition too difficult to accept. s.10A - Power invested.with Election;Commission -Scope of - Held: Power invested with the constitutional authority such as Election Commission should not be a mere empty formality but an effective and stable one, in whom the C citizens of this country can repose faith and look upon to ensure that such unscrupulous elements and their attempts to enter into political administration of this vast country are scuttled. s.10A - Right to inspect accounts lodged by the candidates - Held: Reading s.10A along with Rules 87 to 90, in particular, the right conferred on any person to seek for inspection of the accounts submitted, is not merely to look into the details of the account- If based on the inspection, E made by a person under Rule 88 and the attested copies of such accounts disclose that the candidate concerned committed a very seriousillegality in the matter of submission of account of election expenses,' it must be stated that such a person will have every right to bring it to the notice of the F Election Commission for taking appropriate legal recourse available to that person under'the Act - Once any such \u00b7misfeasance in the submission of account of election expe17ses is brought to the notice of Election Commission, thereafter it would be for the Election Commission to set the G process in motion for deciding the issue as contemplated in s._10A of the Act- Conduct of Election Rules, 1961-rr.87 to 90. s. 10A - Purpose of enquiry- Held: The enquiry to be held u/s.10A is not to examine any allegation of corrupt practice falling uls. 123 of the Act - The only area of A examination to be made in an enquiry u/s. 1 OA is with regard to the lodging of the account of election expenses and whether such lodgment was done in the manner and as required by or under the Act - In the second place, when ~uch an enquiry is held, the scope would be as contained in B s. 77(1) and (3) as well ass. 78- The enquiry u/s.10A would be more or less of a civil nature and therefore, the principles of preponderance of probabilities alone would apply and even after the order of disqualification, if any, is passed u/s. 1 OA, after following the requirement of issuance of show cause c notice, receipt of reply, etc., there is a further remedy available to the contesting candidate u/s.11 by which the aggrieved candidate can demonstrate before the Election Commission as to how the order of disqualification cannot D stand. ss. 77 and 78 - Election expenses - Maintenance of accounts - Held: s. 77 mandates as to how the account of election expenses are to be maintained and the maximum limit that can be expended as prescribed - s. 78 mandates that every contesting candidate. in an election should within E 30 days from the date of election of the returned candidate, lodge with the DEO an account of his election expenses, which should be a true copy of the account kept by him or by his election agent as required u/s. 77 - Reading s. 78 and Rules 87 and 88, the intention of the legislature is explicitly F clear that the maintenance of the correct account of the election expenses within the time limit prescribed is not for the satisfaction of the Election Commission alone - The purport of the said exercise is to ensure that none of the candidates can take it as a formality and file some return G without disclosing their correct particulars, inasmuch as once the true copy of the account maintained is lodged with the DEO it is not only for the candidates who contested in the election but 'any person' meaning thereby, any citizen of this country can have access to verify the account lodged with the DEO and also get a authenticated copy of such a statement-:- In fact, such an exercise is to maintain purity in election. ss.80 to 116 - Status of validly elected candidate - B Challenge - Held: The status of a validly elected candidate in an election can be called in question only before the Election Tribunal (High Court) by way of an Election Petition - The power and jurisdiction u/s. 10A does not clothe the Election Commission to deal with the successful election of C the candidate concerned- In other words, exercising power u/s.10A, the Election Commission cannot set aside the election of a successful candidate - s. 10A talks of only an order of disqualification that can be passed by an Election Commission. Constitution of India: Article 324(1) - Power and duties of Election Commission - Held: Under Article 324(1), the nature of functions, powers such as superintendence, issuance of directions, control of the preparation of the  electoral rolls, the conduct of all elections to Parliament and to the legislature of every St.ate, as well as the elections to the offices of the President and Vice-President, as per the Constitution, is invested with the Election Commission. Judicial Notice : Elections - Manipulations and malpractices adopted and applied in election - It is common knowledge as is widely published in the Press and Media that nowadays in elections, payment of cash to the electorate is rampant and the Election Commission finds it extremely difficult to control such a menace - There are attempts made G to violate the restrictions imposed in the matter of incurring election expenses with a view to woo the electorate concerned \u00b7and thereby, gaining their votes in their favour by corrupt \"means viz by purchasing the votes.
