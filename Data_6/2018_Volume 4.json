Re-Organisation Act carved out the State of Uttarakhand \u2013 Many Kurk Amins including appellants were allocated to the State of Uttarakhand and were absorbed in the Government service of Uttarakhand \u2013 The benefit of the judgment rendered by Supreme Court as well as by the High Court of Allahabad was clearly available to the Kurk Amins whose services had been allocated to the State of Uttarakhand and their past service could not have been wiped off for the purposes of grant of selection grade, promotion scale, post retiral benefits including pension etc. as was done by the High Court \u2013 The impugned judgment whereby the claim of appellant was denied was not in accordance with law and was against the basic principles of service jurisprudence as merely by the act of bifurcation of the State the incumbents would not lose their services for the purpose of pension and other benefits \u2013 The appellants are held entitled to all such relief \u2013 Cost of Rs.1 lac imposed on State of Uttarakhand \u2013 U.P.

Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 s.147 \u2013 Reassessment proceedings \u2013 Held: The use of the words \u2018reason to believe\u2019 in s.147 has to be interpreted schematically as the liberal interpretation of the word would have the consequence of conferring arbitrary powers on the assessing officer who may even initiate such re-assessment proceedings merely on his change of opinion on the basis of same facts and circumstances which has already been considered by him during the original assessment proceedings. Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018change of opinion\u2019 \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: The word change of opinion implies formulation of opinion and then a change thereof \u2013 In terms of assessment proceedings, it means formulation of belief by an assessing officer resulting from what he thinks on a particular question \u2013 It is a result of understanding, experience and reflection.

Investigation \u2013 Botched up investigation \u2013 Miscarriage of justice \u2013 This case on hand is a classic example of poor prosecution and shabby investigation which resulted in acquittal of the accused \u2013 The Investigating Officer is expected to be diligent while discharging his duties \u2013 He has to be fair, transparent and his only endeavour should be to find out the truth \u2013 However, he has not even taken bare minimum care to find out the whereabouts of the imposter who executed the PoA \u2013 The evidence on record clearly revealed that PoA was not executed by the complainant and the beneficiary is the accused, still the accused could not be convicted \u2013 The latches in the lopsided investigation went to the root of the matter and fatal to the case of prosecution."

Criminal Law: Motive \u2013 Evidentiary value \u2013 Held: In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has a role to play \u2013 But to dislodge prosecution\u2019s case solely based on lack of motive would amount to giving credit to this factor, where it is not due. Appeal: Appeal against acquittal \u2013 Interference with and reappreciation of evidence by appellate Court \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: Appellate court is expected to be very cautious in interfering with the order of acquittal \u2013 Its interference is called for, only when there are compelling reasons and substantial grounds.Evidence: Circumstantial evidence \u2013 Value of circumstantial evidence rests in its accumulative effect \u2013 When several such evidences are taken together, they may carry enough probative force to justify the conviction, if such evidence forms an unbroken chain of events resulting in only one hypothesis so canvassed. Witness: Related witness \u2013 Evidentiary value \u2013 Held: Interest of the witness does affect his testimony \u2013 Under the influence of bias, a man may not be in a position to judge correctly \u2013 Therefore, witness having interest in the result, if allowed to be weighed in the same scales with those who do not have any interest in the result, would be to open the doors of the court for perverted truth.

Investigation: Transfer of investigation to central investigating agency \u2013 Writ petition seeking transfer of investigation of all FIRs lodged against the petitioner and other members of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) to an independent investigation agency \u2013 FIRs relates to various offences under IPC, Prevention of Destruction of Property Act, Arms Act, Indian Explosives Act, WBMPO Act and National Highway Act \u2013 Petitioner\u2019s case was that in the light of stand off between the State of West Bengal over the issue of separate State for Ghorkhaland, many prominent leaders and members of GJM were falsely implicated in frivolous cases and there was an imminent threat to their safety and life \u2013 Prayer for transfer was on the ground that there was bias and prejudice against petitioner and all members of GJM and the investigation carried out against the members of GJM was clearly politically motivated \u2013 Held: The records show that there was sufficient material to indicate the severe damage to life and property in the District of Darjeeling and Kalimpong and the protest was no longer peaceful and democratic \u2013 Deaths of several persons which included police personnel is admitted by both the parties \u2013 Names of petitioner and other members of GJM appeared in large number of cases \u2013 The State is obliged to maintain law and order and protect life and property of the citizens \u2013 The cases lodged in the FIR submitted at the instance of the Police or other complainants cannot be discarded on the specious plea that they have been lodged due to bias of the State and with the intent to persecute the petitioner \u2013 No bias or mala fide has been pleaded against any individual State functionary or police officer nor any such person has been impleaded in the writ petition so as to consider the allegation of bias \u2013 In the facts of the case, it is not a fit case to exercise jurisdiction under Art.32 to transfer the cases en masse to an independent agency. Public functionaries: Duties and powers \u2013 The \u201cState\u201d is a political unit vested with constitutional duties and obligations \u2013 The Governor of the State formally represent the State in whom the executive power of the State is vested and exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution of India \u2013 Under List II, Entry I of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, \u201cpublic order\u201d is a subject allocated to the State \u2013 All legislative and executive powers in reference to public order is thus vested in the State \u2013 The State functions through its various organs consisting of different personnels and authorities \u2013 State functionaries have their own rights and obligations entrusted to them under different Statutes governing the field. Police Administration: Duties and powers \u2013 The authorities and police officers, who are entrusted different obligations and functions under the Code of Criminal Procedure, has to act as ordained by the Code \u2013 It is an obligation of the police officers to register a First Information Report when they receive any information regarding commission of a cognizable offence \u2013 For recording such offences, they are neither required to await any instructions from any authority or State nor they have to abdicate their obligation to register F.I.R. as required by Cr.P.C. Constitution of India: Arts.19(1)(a) and (b) \u2013 Right to hold demonstration, limitation \u2013 Held: Arts.19(1)(a) and (b) gives constitutional right to all citizens freedom of speech and expression which includes carrying out public demonstration also but public demonstration when becomes violent and damages the public and private properties and harm lives of people, it goes beyond fundamental rights guaranteed under Art.19(1) and becomes an offence punishable under law."

        "HeadNote": "Habeas Corpus: Writ petition of Habeas corpus filed by respondent-father apprehending that her daughter (respondent no.9) aged 26 years was likely to be transported out of the country \u2013 Daughter of writ petitioner appeared before the Court and categorically declined to go with her parents and expressed her desire to stay with respondent no.7 \u2013 During pendency of writ petition she entered into marriage with appellant \u2013 By impugned order, High Court held that a girl aged 24 years is weak and vulnerable and capable of being exploited in many ways and while exercising parens patriae jurisdiction directed her custody to the writ petitioner-father \u2013 With these directions, the High Court declared the marriage between the appellant and respondent no.9 as null and void \u2013 On appeal, held: The expression of choice is a fundamental right under Arts.19 and 21 of the Constitution, if the said choice does not transgress any valid legal framework \u2013 Once that aspect is clear, the enquiry and determination have to come to an end \u2013 In a writ of habeas corpus, especially in the instant case, it was absolutely unnecessary to reflect upon the social radicalization \u2013 If there is any criminality in any sphere, it is for the law enforcing agency to do the needful but as long as the detenu has not been booked under law to justify the detention which is under challenge, the obligation of the Court is to exercise the celebrated writ that breathes life into our constitutional guarantee of freedom \u2013 In the case at hand, the father in his own stand and perception may feel that there has been enormous transgression of his right to protect the interest of his daughter but his view point cannot be allowed to curtail the fundamental rights of his daughter who, out of her own volition, married the appellant \u2013 Therefore, High Court completely erred by taking upon itself the burden of annulling the marriage between the appellant and respondent no.9 when both stood embedded to their vow of matrimony \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.19 and 21. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI and A. M. Khanwilkar, J.) Habeas Corpus: Role of writ court in entertaining writ petition of Habeas corpus \u2013 Held: The pivotal purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to see that no one is deprived of his/her liberty without sanction of law \u2013 It is the primary duty of the State to see that the said right is not sullied in any manner whatsoever and its sanctity is not affected by any kind of subterfuge \u2013 The role of the Court is to see that the detenu is produced before it, find out about his/her independent choice and see to it that the person is released from illegal restraint \u2013 The issue is different when the detention is not illegal. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.) Habeas Corpus: Writ of Habeas Corpus \u2013 If alleged detenu appears before the writ court and states that she was not under illegal confinement, there is no warrant for the Court to proceed further in exercise of its jurisdiction under Art.226 \u2013 Exercise of jurisdiction to declare the marriage null and void while entertaining a petition for habeas corpus is plainly in excess of judicial power \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.226. (Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.) Constitution of India: Art.21 \u2013 Right of adult to marry a person of his or her own choice \u2013 Jurisdiction of High Court to annul marriage while entertaining writ of habeas corpus \u2013 Held: Deprivation of marital status is a matter of serious import and must be strictly in accordance with law \u2013 High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Art.226 ought not to have embarked on the course of annulling the marriage \u2013 The Constitution recognises the liberty and autonomy which inheres in each individual \u2013 This includes the ability to take decisions on aspects which define one\u2019s personhood and identity \u2013 The choice of a partner whether within or outside marriage lies within the exclusive domain of each individual \u2013 Intimacies of marriage lie within a core zone of privacy, which is inviolable \u2013 The absolute right of an individual to choose a life partner is not in the least affected by matters of faith \u2013 The Constitution guarantees to each individual the right freely to practise, profess and propagate religion \u2013 Choices of faith and belief as indeed choices in matters of marriage lie within an area where individual autonomy is supreme \u2013 In deciding whether appellant is a fit person for writ petitioner\u2019s daughter to marry, the High Court entered into prohibited terrain \u2013 The High Court has transgressed the limits on its jurisdiction in a habeas corpus petition \u2013 In the process, there has been a serious transgression of constitutional rights \u2013 Habeas corpus \u2013 Universal Declaration of Human Rights \u2013 Art.16. (Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.) Doctrines/Principles: Parens Patriae doctrine \u2013 Invocation of \u2013 Held: The doctrine has to be invoked only in exceptional cases where the parties before it are either mentally incompetent or have not come of age and it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the said parties have either no parent/legal guardian or have an abusive or negligent parent/legal guardian \u2013 In the instant case, there was nothing to suggest that respondent no.9 suffered from any kind of mental incapacity or vulnerability \u2013 She was absolutely categorical in her submissions and unequivocal in the expression of her choice \u2013 Therefore, High Court erred in invoking Parens Patriae jurisdiction. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.) Doctrines/Principles: Parens Patriae doctrine \u2013 The superior courts, when they exercise their jurisdiction parens patriae do so in the case of persons who are incapable of asserting a free will such as minors or persons of unsound mind \u2013 The exercise of that jurisdiction should not transgress into the area of determining the suitability of partners to a marital tie \u2013 That decision rests exclusively with the individuals themselves \u2013 Neither the state nor society can intrude into that domain \u2013 The strength of our Constitution lies in its acceptance of the plurality and diversity of our culture \u2013 Intimacies of marriage, including the choices which individuals make on whether or not to marry and on whom to marry, lie outside the control of the state. (Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J.) Words and phrases: Parens Patriae \u2013 Meaning of, discussed. (Per Dipak Misra, CJI and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.)"

Dying declaration: Considerations that make dying declaration dangerous kind of evidence \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Cautious approach of Court to rely on dying declaration \u2013 Dying declaration cannot form the sole basis for conviction unless it is corroborated \u2013 The courts must be cautious and must rely on the same only if it inspires confidence in the mind of the Court \u2013 If the dying declaration creates any suspicion in the mind of Court as to its correctness and genuineness, it should not be acted upon without corroborative evidence. Appeal: Special leave petition \u2013 Reopening of concurrent finding of fact, when permissible \u2013 Discussed."
