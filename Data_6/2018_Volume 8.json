(Majority Opinion) Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Architecture and structure of theAct \u2013 The UIDAI is established as a statutory body which is giventhe task of developing the policy, procedure and system for issuingAadhaar numbers to individuals and also to perform authenticationthereof as per the provisions of the Act \u2013 For the purpose ofenrolment and assigning Aadhaar numbers, enrolling agencies arerecruited by the Authority, which may be a private body/person\u2013 Toenable a resident to get Aadhaar number, he is required to submitdemographic as well as biometric information i.e., apart from givinginformation relating to name, date of birth and address, biometricinformation in the form of photograph, fingerprint, iris scan is alsoto be provided \u2013 Aadhaar number given to a particular person istreated as unique number as it cannot be reassigned to any otherindividual \u2013 Insofar as subsidies, benefits or services to be givenby the government, the government can mandate that receipt ofthese subsidies, benefits and services would be given only onfurnishing proof of possession of Aadhaar number (or proof ofmaking an application for enrolment, where Aadhaar number isnot assigned) \u2013 Such individual would undergo authentication atthe time of receiving such benefits etc. \u2013 A particular institution/body from which the said subsidy, benefit or service is to be claimedby such an individual, the intended recipient would submit hisAadhaar number and is also required to give her biometricinformation to that agency \u2013 On receiving this information and forthe purpose of its authentication, the said agency, known asRequesting Entity (RE), would send the request to the Authority whichshall perform the job of authentication of Aadhaar number \u2013 Onconfirming the identity of a person, the individual is entitled to receivesubsidy, benefit or service \u2013 Aadhaar number is permitted to beused by the holder for other purposes as well. (Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Whether the Aadhaar Projectcreates or has tendency to create surveillance state and is, thus,unconstitutional on this ground \u2013 Held: The architecture of Aadhaaras well as the provisions of the Aadhaar Act do not tend to create asurveillance state \u2013 This is ensured by the manner in which theAadhaar project operates \u2013 Authentication is a process by which Aadhaar number along with demographic information or biometricinformation of an individual is submitted to the CIDR for itsveri fication \u2013 On submission thereof, the CIDR verif ies thecorrectness or lack of it \u2013 While seeking authentication, neither thelocation of the person whose identity is to be verified nor the purposefor which authentication of such identity is required, comes to theknowledge of the Authority.

(Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.29 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Held:s.29 imposes a restriction on sharing information and is, therefore,valid as it protects the interests of Aadhaar number holders.(Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.33 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Held:s.33(1) of the Act prohibits disclosure of information, includingidentity information or authentication records, except when it is byan order of a court not inferior to that of a District Judge \u2013 Thisprovision is to be read down with the clarification that an individual,whose information is sought to be released, shall be afforded anopportunity of hearing \u2013 If such an order is passed, in thateventuality, he shall also have right to challenge such an orderpassed by approaching the higher court \u2013 During the hearing beforethe concerned court, the said individual can always object to thedisclosure of information on accepted grounds in law, includingArt.20(3) of the Constitution or the privacy rights etc. \u2013 Insofar ass.33(2) is concerned, it is held that disclosure of information in theinterest of national security cannot be faulted with \u2013 However, fordetermination of such an eventuality, an officer higher than the rank of a Joint Secretary should be given such a power \u2013 There hasto be a higher ranking officer along with, preferably, a JudicialOfficer \u2013 The provisions contained in s.33(2) of the Act to the extentit gives power to Joint Secretary is, therefore, struck down givingliberty to the respondents to suitably enact a provision on theselines, which would adequately protect the interest of individuals.(Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.47 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 s.47provides that the cognizance would be taken only on a complaintmade by the Authority or any officer or person authorised by it \u2013Petitioners feel aggrieved by this provision as it does not permit anindividual citizen whose rights are violated, to initiate the criminalprocess \u2013 Held: It would be in the fitness of things if s.47 is amendedby allowing individual/victim whose right is violated, to file acomplaint and initiate the proceedings.(Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.57 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 s.57mentions that Aadhaar Act would not prevent use of Aadhaar numberfor other purposes under the law \u2013 Held: Insofar as s.57 in thepresent form is concerned, it is susceptible to misuse inasmuch as:It can be used for establishing the identity of an individual \u2018for anypurpose\u2019 \u2013 Therefore, the provision is read down to mean that sucha purpose has to be backed by law \u2013 Further, whenever any such\u201claw\u201d is made, it would be subject to judicial scrutiny \u2013 Suchpurpose is not limited pursuant to any law alone but can be donepursuant to \u2018any contract to this effect\u2019 as well \u2013 This is clearlyimpermissible as a contractual provision is not backed by a lawand, therefore, first requirement of proportionality test is not met \u2013Apart from authorising the State, even \u2018any body corporate or person\u2019is authorised to avail authentication services which can be on thebasis of purported agreement between an individual and such bodycorporate or person \u2013 Even if it is presumed that legislature did notintend so, the impact of the said features would be to enablecommercial exploitation of an individual biometric and demographicinformation by the private entities \u2013 Thus, this part of the provisionwhich enables body corporate and individuals also to seekauthentication, that too on the basis of a contract between the individual and such body corporate or person, would impinge uponthe right to privacy of such individuals \u2013 This part of the section,thus, is declared unconstitutional. (Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.59 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Whenthe Aadhaar scheme/project under the Act has been saved from thechallenge to its constitutionality, there is no reason to invalidate theenrolments which were made prior to the passing of this Act as itwould lead to unnecessary burden and exercise of enrolling thesepersons all over again \u2013 Instead the problem can be solved byeliciting \u2018consent\u2019 of all those persons who were enrolled prior tothe passing of the Act \u2013 Since, enrolment is voluntary in nature,those who specifically refuse to give the consent, they would beallowed to exit from Aadhaar scheme \u2013 After all, by getting Aadhaarcard, an individual so enrolled is getting a form of identity card \u2013 Itwould still be open to such an individual to make use of the saidAadhaar number or not \u2013 Those persons who need to avail anysubsidy, benefit or service would need Aadhaar in any case. Itwould not be proper to cancel their Aadhaar cards \u2013 If direction isgiven to invalidate all those enrolments which were made prior to2016 then such persons will have to undergo the rigours of gettingthemselves enrolled all over again \u2013 On the other hand, those whodo not get any benefit of the nature prescribed under s.7 of the Act,it would always be open for them not to make use of Aadhaar cardor to make use of this card in a limited sense, namely, showing it asa proof of their identity, without undergoing any authenticationprocess \u2013 Therefore, to a large extent, it does not harm this latercategory as well \u2013 The validity of s.59 is upheld \u2013 As a corollary,Aadhaar for the period from 2009 to 2016 also stands validated.(Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.7 \u2013 Whether the Aadhaar Actcould be passed as \u2018Money Bill\u2019 within the meaning of Art.110 ofthe Constitution \u2013 Held: The importance of Rajya Sabha (UpperHouse) in a bicameral system of the Parliament \u2013 The Rajya Sabhais an important institution signifying constitutional fedaralism \u2013 Toenact any statute, the Bill has to be passed by both the Houses,namely, Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha \u2013 It is the constitutional mandate \u2013 The only exception to this Parliamentary norm is Art.110\u2013 Having regard to this overall scheme of bicameralism enshrinedin our Constitution, strict interpretation has to be accorded toArt.110 \u2013 Insofar as s.7 is concerned, it makes receipt of subsidy,benefit or service subject to establishing identity by the process ofauthentication under Aadhaar or furnish proof of Aadhaar etc. \u2013The expenditure incurred in respect of such a subsidy, benefit orservice is from the Consolidated Fund of India \u2013 s.7 is the mainprovision of the Act \u2013 Introduction to the Act as well as Statement ofObjects and Reasons very categorically record that the main purposeof Aadhaar Act is to ensure that such subsidies, benefits and servicesreach those categories of persons, for whom they are actually meant\u2013 As all these three kinds of welfare measures are sought to beextended to the marginalised section of society, a collective readingthereof would show that the purpose is to expand the coverage ofall kinds of aid, support, grant, advantage, relief provisions, facility,utility or assistance which may be extended with the support of theConsolidated Fund of India with the objective of targeted delivery\u2013 Various schemes contemplated by these provisions, relate tovulnerable and weaker section of the society \u2013 That is the mainfunction behind the Aadhaar Act and for this purpose, enrolmentfor Aadhaar number is prescribed \u2013 Such an enrolment is ofvoluntary nature \u2013 However, it becomes compulsory for those whoseek to receive any subsidy, benefit or service under the welfarescheme of the Government expenditure whereof is to be met fromthe Consolidated Fund of India \u2013 It follows that authentication unders.7 would be required as a condition for receipt of a subsidy, benefitor service only when such a subsidy, benefit or service is takencare of by Consolidated Fund of India \u2013 Therefore, s.7 is the coreprovision of the Aadhaar Act and this provision satisfies theconditions of Art.110 of the Constitution \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013Art.110. (Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Data minimisation \u2013 Demographicinformation is readily provided by individuals globally for disclosingidentity while relating with others and while seeking benefits whetherprovided by government or by private entities, be it registration forcit izenship, elections, passports, marriage or enrolment in educational institutions \u2013 Email IDs and phone numbers are alsoavailable in public domain \u2013 s.2(k) specifically provides thatRegulations cannot include race, religion, caste, tribe, ethnicity,language, records of entitlement, income or medical history \u2013 Thus,sensitive information specifically stand excluded \u2013 s.32(3) of theAadhaar Act specifically prohibits the authority from collecting,storing or maintaining, either directly or indirectly any informationabout the purpose of authentication \u2013 The proviso to Regn 26 ofAuthentication Regulations is also to the same effect \u2013 Thus, theprinciple of data minimization is largely followed. (MajorityOpinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.2(k) \u2013 Requirement under theAadhaar Act to give one\u2019s demographic information \u2013 Whetherviolative of fundamental right of privacy \u2013 Held: Regn.4 indicatesthat information which shall be collected from individual are hisname, date of birth, gender and residential address \u2013 The additionalinformation which can be collected at the option of the individualis mobile number and e-mail address \u2013 Thus, informationcontemplated under Regn 4 is nothing but information relating toidentity of the person \u2013 The identity of person from the time of takingbirth is an identity well known and generally every person describeshimself or herself to be son or daughter of such and such person \u2013People who take admissions in schools/colleges/ university, whoseek employment and those who engage in various trade andcommerce are all required to provide demographic information \u2013Therefore, there cannot be a reasonable expectation of privacy withregard to such information \u2013 Thus, demographic informationrequired to be given in the process of enrolment does not violateany right of privacy \u2013 Aadhaar (Enrolment and Update) Regulations,2016 \u2013 Regn 4. (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.2(g) \u2013 Requirement under theAadhaar Act to give one\u2019s biometric information \u2013 Whether violativeof fundamental right of privacy \u2013 Held: Biometric information meansphotographs, fingerprints, iris scan and other such biometricattributes of an individual as may be specified by the regulations Biometric information is of physical characteristics of a person \u2013 Aperson has full bodily autonomy and any intrusion in the bodilyautonomy of a person can be readily accepted as breach of hisprivacy \u2013 The biometric data as referred to in s.2(g) may containbiological attributes of an individual with regard to which a personcan very well claim a reasonable expectation of privacy but whetherprivacy rights have been breached or not needs to be examined inthe subject context under which the information was obtained. (PerAshok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.2(g) \u2013 Whether obtainingbiometric information in context of enrolment breaches the right ofprivacy of individual or not \u2013 Held: The provisions of Aadhaar Actare to be tested in light of three-fold test laid in Puttaswamy case \u2013The First requirement to be fulfilled is existence of law \u2013 Admittedly,Aadhaar Act is a Parliamentary law, hence the existence of law issatisfied \u2013 The Aadhaar Act has been enacted with an object ofproviding Aadhaar number to individuals for identifying anindividual for delivery of benefits, subsidies and services \u2013 AadhaarAct, which was enacted to provide for unique identity for deliveryof subsidies, benefits or services was a dire necessity, which decisionwas arrived at after several reports and studies \u2013 Aadhaar Actwas, thus, enacted for a legitimate State aim and fulfills the criteriaof a law being fair and reasonable \u2013 While examining the thirdrequirement, that is, proportionality of the statute, it has to be keptin mind that the state is neither arbitrary nor of an excessive naturebeyond what is required in the interest of public \u2013 The object of theAadhaar Act was to provide for unique identity for purposes ofdelivery of benefi ts, subsidies and services to the eligiblebeneficiaries and to ward of misappropriation of benefits andsubsidies, ward of deprivation of eligible beneficiaries \u2013 Biometricinformation, thus, which is to be obtained for enrolment is notdisproportionate nor the provisions of Aadhaar Act requiringdemographic and biometric information can be said to be notpassing three-fold test as laid down in Puttaswamy case \u2013 Thus,requirement under Aadhaar Act to give one\u2019s demographic andbiometric information does not violate fundamental right of privacyand, therefore, is not unconstitutional \u2013 Constitution of India Biometric information \u2013 Right to privacy. (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Whether proportionality test asenvisaged in Puttaswamy case is not fulfilled in the instant casesince State did not adopt an alternative and more suitable and leastintrusive method of identification \u2013 Held: The biometric informationwhich are obtained for Aadhaar enrolment are photographs,fingerprints and iris scan, which are least intrusion in physicalautonomy of an individual \u2013 The physical process by which thefingerprints are taken does not require information beyond theobject and purpose \u2013 Therefore, it does not readily offend thoseprinciples of dignity and privacy, which are fundamental to eachlegislation of due process. (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: ss.29, 30, 33 \u2013 Whether collectionof data of residents, its storage, retention and use violatesfundamental right of privacy \u2013 Held: The Act contains specificprovision providing that no core biometric information collectedunder the Act is shared to anyone for any reason whatsoever or usefor any purpose other than generation of Aadhaar number orauthentication under this Act \u2013 The statute creates injunction forrequesting entity to use identity information data for any purposeother than that specified to the individual at the time for submittingany identification \u2013 Statute also provides for offences and penaltiesfor impersonation at the time of enrolment and penalty for disclosingidentity information \u2013 An overview of the entire scheme of functionsunder the Aadhaar Act and Regulations made thereunder indicatethat after enrolment of resident, his informations including biometricinformation are retained in CIDR though in encrypted form \u2013 Themajor function of the authority under Aadhaar Act is authenticationof identity of Aadhaar number holder as and when requests aremade by requesting agency, retention of authentication data ofrequesting agencies are retained for limited period \u2013 Requestingentity as well as authority are required to retain authentication datafor a particular period and thereafter it will be archived for fiveyears and thereafter authentication data transaction shall be deletedexcept such data which is required by the Court in connection withany pending dispute \u2013 The data which is retained by the entity and authority for certain period is minimal information pertaining toidentity authentication only no other personal data is retained \u2013Thus, provisions of Aadhaar Act and Regulations made thereunderfulfill three fold test as laid down in Puttaswamy case, hence, thestorage and retention of data does not violate fundamental right ofprivacy. (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.7 \u2013 Whether s.7 is unconstitutional\u2013 Whether exclusion makes s.7 arbitrary and volative of Arts.14and 21 \u2013 Held: s.7 is an enabling provision which empowers theState Government to require that such individual undergoauthentication for receipt of a subsidy, benefit or service but neithers.7 nor orders issued by the Central Government and StateGovernment can be read that in the event authentication of a personor beneficiary fails, he is not to be provided the subsidies andbenefits or services \u2013 No doubt, there has been denial to few personsdue to failure of authentication \u2013 Functioning of scheme formulatedby the Government for delivery of benefi ts and subsidies todeserving persons is a large scale scheme running into every nookand corner of the country \u2013 When such scheme of Government isimplemented, it is not uncommon that there may be shortcomingsand some denial \u2013 There is no material on record to indicate thatthere is increase of failure to receive the benefits after theimplementation of the Act \u2013Therefore, few cases of exclusion wouldnot make s.7 itself arbitrary and violative of Arts.14 and 21 \u2013Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 21.

(Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.33 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013Whether s.33 is unconstitutional since it provides for the use of theAadhaar data base for Police verification which violates theprotection against self-incrimination as enshrined under Art.20(3)of the Constitution of India \u2013 Held: Sub-section (1) of s.33 containsan ample restriction in respect of any disclosure information whichcan be done only in pursuance of an order of the court not inferiorto that of a District Judge \u2013 The restriction in disclosure ofinformation is reasonable and has valid justification \u2013 s.33 subsection(2) contains two safeguards \u2013 Firstly, disclosure ofinformation is to be made in the interest of national security andsecondly, in pursuance of a direction of an officer not below therank of Joint Secretary to the Government, who is speciallyauthorised in this behalf by an order of the Central Government \u2013National security, thus, is determined by a higher officer who isspecifically authorised in this behalf \u2013 The power given under s.33to disclose information cannot be said to be disproportionate \u2013 Thebasic information which are with the UIDAI are demographic andbiometric information \u2013 The use of information retained by the UIDAIgiven by the order of the Court under s.33 cannot be said to beviolating the protection as contained under Art.20(3) \u2013 Thus,Art.20(3) is not violated by disclosure of information under s.33 \u2013In view of this, s.33 is constitutional \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013Art.20(3). (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.47 \u2013 Constitutionality of,challenged on the ground that it does not allow an individual whois victim of violation of Aadhaar Act to initiate a criminal process \u2013Held: Special Acts are enacted for serving special objects towardsoffences under the Act \u2013 The initiation and prosecution of offencesunder the Special Act are kept by the specified authority to keepthe initiation and prosecution in the hands of the authorities underthe Special Act which acts as deterrent and prosecutions are broughtto its logical end \u2013 Objective of such provisions is to discouragefrivolous and vexatious complaints \u2013 s.47 can be invoked by the authority on its own motion or when it receives a complaint from avictim \u2013 With regard to an offence which falls within the definitionof \u2018offences\u2019 a victim can always file complaint or lodge an F.I.R. \u2013s.46 clearly provides that the penalties under the Aadhaar Act shallnot interfere with other punishments \u2013 The limitation as containedin s.47 in permitting taking cognizance of any offence punishableunder Aadhaar Act only on a complaint made by the authority orany officer or person authorised by it, has legislative purpose andobjective \u2013 Thus, there is no unconstitutionality in s.47 of theAadhaar Act. (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.57 \u2013 Constitutionality of,challenged on the ground that broad and unlimited scope of activitiescovered under s.57 and kinds of private entities permitted to useAadhaar is entirely disproportionate beyond the means andobjectives of the Act and without any compelling state interests \u2013Held: s.57 makes use of Aadhaar on two basis \u2013 Firstly, \u201cpursuantto any law, for the time being in force\u201d and secondly \u201cany contractto this effect\u201d \u2013 When the legislature uses the phrase \u201cpursuant toany law, for the time being in force\u201d, obviously the word law usedin s.57 is a law other than s.57 of Aadhaar Act and the Regulationsframed thereunder \u2013 When any law permits user of Aadhaar, itsvalidity is to be tested on the anvil of three-fold test as laid down inPuttaswamy case, but permitting use of Aadhaar on any contract tothis effect, is clearly in violation of Right of Privacy \u2013 A contractentered between two parties, even if one party is a State, cannot besaid to be a law \u2013 Thus, s.57 in so far as it permits use of Aadhaaron \u201cany contract to this effect\u201d is clearly unconstitutional and isstruck down. (Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.59 \u2013 Whether s.59 is void orunconstitutional \u2013 s.59 seeks to save and continue under the Actwhat was done under the executive scheme \u2013 Legislature often createslegal fiction to save several actions which had happened prior toenactment \u2013 Parliamentary legislative intent of s.59 is to save allactions taken by Central Government under the notification dtd.28.01.2009 and notification dtd. 12.09.2015 deeming the same tohave been validly done under the Aadhaar Act by creating a legal fiction \u2013 The intention to save all actions taken under these twonotifications and treat them to have done under that Act is thepurpose and object of s.59 \u2013 Legislature by legislative device cancover actions taken earlier while creating any legal fiction whichhas actually been done by s.59 \u2013 Interpretation of statutes \u2013 Legalfiction.

(Majority Opinion)Income Tax Act, 1961: s.139AA \u2013 Whether s.139-AA of theIT Act, 1961 is unconstitutional in view of the Privacy judgment inPuttaswamy case \u2013 Held: s.139-A provide for Permanent AccountNumber (PAN) and the provision also provided that statutorymandatory provisions as to when \u201cevery person\u201d shall quote suchnumber (PAN number) for various purposes as enumerated in s.139A\u2013 Introduction of s.139-AA is an extension and implication of s.139A\u2013 The introduction of s.139-AA was for the purpose of eliminatingduplicate PANs from the system with the help of a robust technologysolution \u2013 s.139-AA seeks to remove bogus PAN cards by linkingwith Aadhaar, expose shell companies and thereby curb the menaceof black money, money laundering and tax evasion \u2013 Linking ofPAN with Aadhaar will at least ensure that duplicate and fake PANcards which are used for the purpose of tax evasion will be eliminatedand is one of the many fiscal measures to eliminate black moneyfrom the system \u2013 s.139-AA also cannot be said to be disproportionate\u2013 The section has been enacted to achieve the legitimate State aim s.139-AA is a law framed by Parliament, which require linking ofthe Aadhaar with PAN \u2013 s.139-AA is a required first step to weedout fake PANs for individuals; it is perfectly acceptable for thelegislature to weed out fake PANs for other tax-paying entities at alater stage \u2013 Inclusion of Aadhaar into PAN eliminates the inequalitybetween honest tax payers and non-compliant, dishonest ones whoget away without paying taxes \u2013 Inclusion of Aadhaar into PANbolsters equality and is consistent with Art.14 \u2013 In result, s.139-AAis fully compliant of three-fold test as laid down in Puttaswamy\u2019scase \u2013 s.139-AA, thus does not breach fundamental Right of Privacyof an individual and cannot be struck down.(Per Ashok Bhushan, J.)Interim Orders: As per the petitioners, the CentralGovernment and the State Government have issued certainnotifications requiring Aadhaar authentication for benefits, subsidiesand schemes mandatory and, therefore, the respondents haveviolated the orders of this court \u2013 Held: The said interim orderswere passed by the court when the Aadhaar Act had not come intoforce \u2013 After the enactment, s.7 had altered the position statutorily\u2013 The notifications and circulars are issued under this provision \u2013Therefore, it cannot be held that these circulars are issued incontravention of the orders passed by this court \u2013 Aadhaar (TargetedDelivery of Financial and other subsidies, benefits and services)Act, 2016. (Majority Opinion)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: The entire Aadhaar programme,since 2009, suffers from constitutional infirmities and violations offundamental rights \u2013 The enactment of the Aadhaar Act does notsave the Aadhaar project \u2013 The Aadhaar Act, the Rules andRegulations framed under it, and the framework prior to theenactment of the Act are held unconstitutional.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.7 \u2013 Aadhaar Act challenged onthe ground that it could not have been passed as a Money Bill \u2013Held: To be certified a Money Bill, a Bill must contain \u201conlyprovisions\u201d dealing with every or any one of the matters set out insub-clauses (a) to (g) of Art.110(1) \u2013 A Bill, which has both provisions which fall within sub-clauses (a) to (g) of Art.110(1) andprovisions which fall outside their scope, will not qualify to be aMoney Bill \u2013 Thus, when a Bill which has been passed as a MoneyBill has certain provisions which fall beyond the scope of sub-clauses(a) to (g) of Art.110(1), these provisions cannot be severed \u2013 TheAadhaar Act creates a statutory framework for obtaining a uniqueidentity number, which is capable of being used for \u201cany\u201d purpose,among which availing benefits, subsidies and services, for whichexpenses are incurred from the Consolidated Fund of India, is justone purpose provided under s.7 \u2013 Clause (e) of Art.110(1) requiresthat a Money Bill must deal with the declaring of any expenditureto be expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India (orincreasing the amount of the expenditure) \u2013 s.7 fails to fulfil thisrequirement \u2013 s.7 does not declare the expenditure incurred to be acharge on the Consolidated Fund \u2013 It only provides that in the caseof such services, benefits or subsidies, Aadhaar can be mademandatory to avail them \u2013 Moreover, provisions other than s.7 ofthe Act deal with several aspects relating to the Aadhaar numbers:enrolment on the basis of demographic and biometric information,generation of Aadhaar numbers, obtaining the consent ofindividuals before collecting their individual information, creationof a statutory authority to implement and supervise the process,protection of information collected during the process, disclosureof information in certain circumstances, creation of offences andpenalties for disclosure or loss of information, and the use of theAadhaar number for \u201cany purpose\u201d \u2013 All these provisions of theAadhaar Act do not lie within the scope of sub-clauses (a) to (g) ofArt.110(1) \u2013 Thus, the Aadhaar Act is declared unconstitutional forfailing to meet the necessary requirements to have been certified asa Money Bill under Art.110(1) \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.110.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Legitimate State aim, insufficientto hold validity of law \u2013 Held: The architecture of the Aadhaar Actseeks to create a unique identity for residents on the basis of theirdemographic and biometric information \u2013 The Act sets up a processof identification by which the unique identity assigned to eachindividual is verified with the demographic and biometric information pertaining to that individual which is stored in acentralised repository of data \u2013 Identification of beneficiaries isintegral and essential to the fulfilment of social welfare schemesand programmes, which are a part of the State\u2019s attempts to ensurethat its citizens have access to basic human facilities \u2013 Thecontention of the Union of India that there is a legitimate state aimin maintaining a system of identification to ensure that the welfarebenefits provided by the State reach the beneficiaries who areentitled, without diversion, is accepted \u2013 The decision in Puttaswamyrecognised that revenue constitutes a legitimate state aim in the threeprongedtest of proportionality \u2013 However, the existence of alegitimate aim is insufficient to uphold the validity of the law, whichmust also meet the other parameters of proportionality spelt out inPuttaswamy. (Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Collection of biometric data andits retention \u2013 The Aadhaar programme involves application ofbiometric technology, which uses an individual\u2019s biometric data asthe basis of authentication or identification and is thereforeintimately connected to the individual \u2013 While citizens have privacyinterests in personal or private information collected about them,the unique nature of biometric data distinguishes it from otherpersonal data, compounding concerns regarding privacy protectionssafeguarding biometric information \u2013 Once a biometric system iscompromised, it is compromised forever \u2013 Therefore, it is imperativethat concerns about protecting privacy must be addressed whiledeveloping a biometric system \u2013 Adequate norms must be laid downfor each step from the collection to retention of biometric data \u2013 Atthe time of collection, individuals must be informed about thecollection procedure, the intended purpose of the collection, thereason why the particular data set is requested and who will haveaccess to their data \u2013 Additionally, the retention period must bejustified and individuals must be given the right to access, correctand delete their data at any point in time, a procedure familiar toan opt-out option.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: The Aadhaar Act and Regulationsare bereft of the procedure through which an individual can access information related to his or her authentication record \u2013 TheAadhaar Act clearly has no defined options that should be madeavailable to the Aadhaar number holders in case they do not wishto submit identity information during authentication, nor do theregulations specify the procedure to be followed in case the Aadhaarnumber holder does not provide consent for authentication \u2013 Toenable the government to initiate steps for ensuring conformity withthis judgment, it is directed under Art.142 that the existing datawhich has been collected shall not be destroyed for a period of oneyear \u2013 During this period, the data shall not be used for any purposewhatsoever \u2013 At the end of one year, if no fresh legislation has beenenacted by the Union government in conformity with the principleswhich have been enunciated in this judgment, the data shall bedestroyed \u2013 Constitut ion of India \u2013 Art.142.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: ss.2(g), (j), (k) and (t), 29(1) and(2) \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Invasion in privacy of an individual \u2013ss.29(1) and (2) of the Act create a distinction between two classesof information (core biometric information and identity information),which are integral to individual identity and require equal protection\u2013 s.29(4) suffers from overbreadth as it gives wide discretionarypower to UIDAI to publish, display or post core biometricinformation of an individual for purposes speci fied by theregulations \u2013 ss.2(g), (j), (k) and (t) suffer from overbreadth, asthese can lead to an invasive collection of biological attributes \u2013These provisions give discretionary power to UIDAI to define thescope of biometric and demographic information and empower itto expand on the nature of information already collected at the timeof enrollment, to the extent of also collecting any \u201csuch otherbiological attributes\u201d that i t may deem fit.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: s.28(5) \u2013 Violation of informationalprivacy \u2013 The proviso to s.28(5) of the Aadhaar Act, which disallowsan individual access to the biometric information that forms thecore of his or her unique ID, is violative of a fundamental principlethat ownership of an individual\u2019s data must at all times vest with the individual \u2013 UIDAI is also provided wide powers in relation toremoving the biometric locking of residents \u2013 The analysis of themeasures taken by the Government of India prior to the enactmentof the Aadhaar Act as well as a detailed analysis of the provisionsunder the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and supporting Regulations madeunder it clearly show that the Aadhaar programme violates essentialnorms pertaining to informational privacy, self-determination anddata protection. (Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Dignity of an individual \u2013 Biometrictechnology which is the core of the Aadhaar programme isprobabilistic in nature, leading to authentication failures \u2013 TheAadhaar project has failed to account for and remedy the flaws inits framework and design which has led to serious instances ofexclusion of eligible beneficiaries as demonstrated by the officialfigures from Government records including the Economic Survey ofIndia 2016-17 and research studies \u2013 Dignity and the rights ofindividuals cannot be made to depend on algorithms or probabilities\u2013 Constitutional guarantees cannot be subject to the vicissitudes oftechnology \u2013 Denial of benefits arising out of any social securityscheme which promotes socio-economic rights of citizens is violativeof human dignity and impermissible under our constitutional scheme.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Test of necessi ty andproportionality \u2013 Violation of data minimisation principles \u2013 Underthe Aadhaar project, requesting entities can hold the identityinformation of individuals, for a temporary period \u2013 It was admittedby UIDAI that AUAs may store additional information according totheir requirement to secure their system \u2013 ASAs have also beenpermitted to store logs of authentication transactions for a specifictime period \u2013 It has been admitted by UIDAI that it gets the AUAcode, ASA code, unique device code and the registered device codeused for authentication, and that UIDAI would know from whichdevice the authentication took place and through which AUA/ASA\u2013 Under the Regulations, UIDAI further stores the authenticationtransaction data \u2013 This is in violation of widely recognized dataminimisation principles which mandate that data collectors and processors delete personal data records when the purpose for whichit has been collected is fulfilled \u2013 Moreover, using the meta-datarelated to the transaction, the location of the authentication caneasily be traced using the IP address, which impacts upon theprivacy of the individual. (Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Risk of potential surveillance \u2013When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, it becomes a bridgeacross discreet data silos, which allows anyone with access to thisinformation to re-construct a profile of an individual\u2019s life \u2013 This iscontrary to the right to privacy and poses severe threats due topotential surveillance \u2013 From the verification log, it is possible tolocate the places of transactions by an individual in the past fiveyears \u2013 It is also possible through the Aadhaar database to trackthe current location of an individual, even without the verificationlog \u2013 The architecture of Aadhaar poses a risk of potentialsurveillance activities through the Aadhaar database \u2013 Any leakagein the verification log poses an additional risk of an individual\u2019sbiometric data being vulnerable to unauthorised exploitation bythird parties \u2013 The biometric database in the CIDR is accessible tothird-party vendors providing biometric search and de-duplicationalgorithms, since neither the Central Government nor UIDAI havethe source code for the de-duplication technology which is at theheart of the programme \u2013 The source code belongs to a foreigncorporation \u2013 UIDAI is merely a licensee \u2013 Prior to the enactmentof the Aadhaar Act, without the consent of individual citizens, UIDAIcontracted with L-1 Identity Solutions (the foreign entity whichprovided the source code for biometric storage) to provide to it anypersonal information related to any resident of India \u2013 This iscontrary to the basic requirement that an individual has the right toprotect herself by maintaining control over personal information \u2013The protection of the data of 1.2 billion citizens is a question ofnational security and cannot be subjected to the mere terms andconditions of a normal contract. (Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.)Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Enrolment by private parties \u2013Before the enactment of the Aadhaar Act, MOUs between UIDI andRegistrars were not contracts within the purview of Art.299 of the Constitution, and therefore, do not cover the acts done by the privateentities engaged by the Registrars for enrolment \u2013 Since there is noprivity of contract between UIDAI and the Enrolling agencies, theactivities of the private parties engaged in the process of enrolmentbefore the enactment of the Aadhaar Act have no statutory or legalbacking \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.299.(Per Dr. D Y Chandrachud, J.) Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies,benefits and services) Act, 2016: Aadhaar Act silent on the liabilityof UIDAI \u2013 Under the Aadhaar architecture, UIDAI is the soleauthority which carries out all administrative, adjudicatory,investigative, and monitoring functions of the project \u2013 While theAct confers these functions on UIDAI, it do"
