Punishment - Judicial review - Held: Court while undertaking judicial review of the matter is not supposed to substitute its own opinion on reappraisal of facts - In exercise G of power of judicial review, court can interfere with the punishment imposed when it is found to be totally irrational or is outrageous in defiance of logic - Entering the school premises in working hours in an inebriated condition and thereafter forcibly entering into Principal's room would constitute a serious misconduct - Penalty of removal for such A a misconduct cannot be treated as disproportionate - Constitution of India, 1950 - Art. 14.

SOCIAL JUSTICE: Reservation in employment for persons with disabilities - Held: Employment is a key factor in the empowerment and inclusion of people with disabilities -- It is an alarming reality that the disabled people are out of job not because their disability comes in the way of their functioning rather it is social and practical barriers that prevent them from joining the workforce - Therefore, bringing them in the society based on G their capabilities is the need of the hour - State has a categorical obligation under the Constitution of India and under various International treaties relating to human rights in general and treaties for disabled persons in particular, to protect the rights of disabled persons - Directions issued to ensure proper implementation of reservation policy for persons with disability and to protect their rights.

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW: Public employment - Non-consideration of claim of candidates on unjust grounds -- Damages - Held: Even  though appellants cannot get the relief sought, they must get damages for non-consideration on unjust grounds, as Commissioner for Commercial Tax had acted to reduce the zone of consideration, contrary to the rules, and instructions -- The award of damages is necessary also as those who are  responsible for administration cannot trample upon rights of others on the grounds which are unsustainable in law -- Therefore, State Government is directed to pay to appellants the damages and litigation costs, as ordered in the judgment and may recover the amounts from erring officer(s) -  Damages.
