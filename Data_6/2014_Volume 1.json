Service Law: Promotion - Major General in DRDO - Recommended by Selection Board for promotion as Lieutenant General - Granted extensions to enable his case for promotion to be  considered by Appointment Committee of the Cabinet - ACC not granting approval to recommendations, as rules would not permit promotion on extension - Held: Selection Board, out of a panel of four names, had recommended promotion of appellant as Lieutenant General on the basis of his record of service, past performance, qualities of leadership, as well as vision- ACC did not in any manner upset the finding recorded by Selection Board nor did it negate the said recommendation - Therefore, appellant must be deemed to have been found suitable for promotion as Lieutenant General, even by ACC and, as such, appellant deserves promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General from the date due to him and he shall be deemed to have been in service as Lieutenant General till 28.2.2009 and entitled to all monetary benefits which would have been so due to him. Promotion during extension of service - Held: The vacancy against which appellant was considered had arisen well before date of his superannuation, but since Service Selection Board was convened only two days prior to date of his superannuation as Major General, respondents must squarely shoulder the blame and responsibility of the delay - It is not as if the vacancy came into existence after appellant had reached the age of retirement on superannuation - The denial of promotion to him mainly for the reason that he was on extension in service, is unsustainable besides being arbitrary- Therefore, the basis on which the claim of appellant for promotion as Lieutenant General was declined by ACC is rejected - Accordingly, operative part of order of ACC is set aside. Constitution of India, 1950: Arts. 14 and 16 - Claim for promotion - Held: Division Bench of High Court has rightly held that recommendations of Selection Board were merely recommendatory in nature and, therefore, appellant had no fundamental right for promotion solely on the basis of such recommendation - However, non-consideration of claim of appellant would violate fundamental rights vested in him. under Arts. 14 and 16, as respondents were desirous of filling up the said vacancy and appellant being the senior most serving Major General eligible for consideration had fundamental right of being considered against the said vacancy, and also the fundamental right of being promoted if he was adjudged suitable - It was in order to extend the benefit of the fundamental right enshrined under Art. 14 of India, that he was allowed extension in service on two occasions by Presidential orders - By the said orders, respondents desired to treat the appellant justly, so as to enable him to acquire the honour of promotion to the rank of Lieutenant General, in case the recommendation made in his favour by the Selection Board was approved by ACC - The action of authorities in depriving the appellant due consideration for promotion to the rank of the Lieutenant General, would have been arbitrary and resulted in violation of his fundamental right under Art. 14.

Articles 72/161 - Nature of power guaranteed under - Held: The power vested in the President u!Article 72 and the Governor u/Article 161 is a Constitutional duty - It is neither a matter of grace nor a matter of privilege but is an important constitutional responsibility reposed by the people in the  highest authority - The power of pardon is essentially an executive action, which needs to be exercised in the aid of justice and not in defiance of it - The said power is to be exercised on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers - Also, Articles 721161 of the Constitution entail remedy to all  the convicts and is not limited to only death sentence cases.Articles 72/161 - Limited Judicial Review of the executive orders u/Article 721161 - Held: Executive orders u/Articles 721 161 should be subject to limited judicial review based on the rationale that the power under Articles 72/161 is per se above judicial review, however, the manner of exercise of power is certainly subject to judicial review - Administrative law.Articles 721161 - Processing the mercy petition - Procedure adopted u!Articles 721161- Discussed.Articles 72/161 - Mercy petition - Limitation period for adjudication - Held: After the completion of the judicial process, if the convict files a mercy petition to the Governor/ President, it is incumbent on the authorities to dispose of the same expeditiously - Though no time limit can be fixed for the Governor and the President, it is the duty of the executive to expedite the matter at every stage, viz., calling for the records, orders and documents filed in the court, preparation of the note for approval of the Minister concerned, and the ultimate decision of the constitutional authorities - Limitation.Articles 721161 - Mercy petition - Procedural Lapses - Held: Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India has detailed procedure regarding handling of petitions for mercy in death sentence cases - The Rules make it clear that at H every stage the matter has to be expedited and there cannot be any delay at the instance of the officers, particularly, the A Superintendent of Jail, in view of the language used therein as \"at once\" - Apart from these Rules\u00b7 regarding presentation of mercy petitions and disposal thereof, necessary instructions have been issued for preparation of note to be approved by the Home Minister and for passing appropriate orders by the President of India .Article 21 - Right to life - Rights of accused vis-a-vis right of victim - Held: While Article 21 is the paramount principle on which rights of the convicts are based, it must be considered along with the rights of the victims or the deceased's family as also societal consideration since these elements form part of the sentencing process as well.Article 32 - Writ petition by death convict asserting violation of Article 21 on account of undue, unreasonable and D prolonged delay in disposal of his mercy petition - Held: When Article 21 is violated, it is not a question of judicial review but of protection of fundamental rights and courts give substantial relief not merely procedural protection - The question of violation of Article 21, its effects and the E appropriate relief is the domain of Supreme Court - There is no question of remanding the matter for consideration because Supreme Court is the custodian and enforcer of fundamental rights and the final interpreter of the Constitution - Further, Article 21 is the paramount principle on which rights F of the convict are based, this must be considered along with the rights of the victims or the deceased's family as also societal consideration.Guidelines: Mercy petitions - Guidelines for effective governing of the procedure of filing mercy petitions and for the cause of the death convicts - Framed.s.354(5) - Death sentence - Execution by hanging - Held: The method of hanging prescribed by s.354(5) is not violative of the guaranteed right ul Article 21 of the Constitution on the basis of scientific evidence and opinions of eminent medical persons which assured that hanging is the least B painful way of ending the life.Prison Act, 1894:s.30(2) - Solitary confinement- In case of prisoner under sentence of death - Held: Solitary confinement, even if  mollified and modified marginally, is not sanctioned by s.30 of the Act for prisoners 'under sentence of death' - The crucial holding u/s.30(2) is that a person is not 'under sentence of death', even if the Sessions Court has sentenced him to death subject to confirmation by the High Court - He is not 'under  sentence of death' even if the High Court imposes, by confirmation or fresh appellate infliction, death penalty, so long as an appeal to the Supreme Court is likely to be or has been moved or is pending - Even if Supreme Court has awarded capital sentence, s.30 does not cover him so long  as his petition for mercy to the Governor and/or to the President permitted by the Constitution, has not been disposed of - Thus, only after rejection of mercy petition by the Governor and the President, and on further application, if there is no stay of execution by the authorities, the person is  under sentence of death - During that interregnum, he attracts the custodial segregation specified in s.30(2), subject to the ameliorative meaning assigned to the provision - To be 'under sentence of death' means 'to be under a finally executable death sentence'.

Ss.7, 2(2) - Forfeiture of properties - If violative of Article 20 of Constitution - Held: The application of the Act is limited to persons who have either suffered a conviction under one of the acts specified in s.2(2)(a) of the Act or detained under the COFEPOSA subsequent to the commencement of the Act in question - Apart from that there are other categories of persons to whom the Act applies - Of all the five categories of persons to whom the Act is made applicable, only oneid category specified u/s.2(2)(a) happens to be of persons who are found guilty of an offence under one of the enactments mentioned therein and convicted - The other four categories of persons to whom the Act is applicable are persons unconnected with any crime or conviction under any law while the category of persons falling u/s.2(2)(b) are persons who are believed by the State to be violators of law - The other three categories are simply persons who are associated with either of the two categories mentioned in s.2(2)(a) and (b) - At least with reference to the four categories other than the one covered by s.2(2)(a), the forfeiture/deprivation of the property is not a consequence of any conviction for an offence - Therefore, with reference to these four categories, the question of violation of Article 20 does not arise - In case of first category, Article 20 would have no application for the reason, conviction is only a factor by which the Parliament chose to identify the persons to whom the Act be made applicable - The Act does not provide for the confiscation of the properties of all the convicts falling u/s.2(2)(a) or detenues falling u/ s.2(2)(b). s.2(2) - Forfeiture of illegally acquired property - Legality of - Held: There is a public interest in ensuring that persons who cannot establish that they have legitimate sources to acquire the assets held by them do not enjoy such wealth - Such a deprivation would certainly be consistent with the requirement of Article 300A and 14 of the Constitution which prevent the State from arbitrarily depriving a subject of his property - Even otherwise, in view of its inclusion in the IXth Schedule, the Act is immune from attack on the ground that it violates any of the rights guaranteed under Part Ii! of the Constitution by virtue of the declaration under Article 31-B - Constitution of India, 1950 - Articles 14, 31-B, 300A.

Regard being had to his official position, it was expected of him to maintain discipline, act with responsibility, perform his duty with sincerity and serve the institution with honesty - This kind of conduct cannot be countenanced as it creates a concavity in the work culture and ushers indiscipline in an organization --Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply And Sewerage Board Employees (Discipline And Appeal) Regulations, 1978 -- Regulations 6(1) and 6(2). Proportionality of punishment - Long absence from duty - Dismissal - Held: Doctrine of proportionality in the context of imposition of punishment in service law gets attracted when the court on the analysis of material brought on record comes to the conclusion that punishment imposed by disciplinary authority or appellate authority shocks the conscience of court Unauthorized absence by an employee, as misconduct, \u2018cannot be put into a straight-jacket formula for imposition of punishment - Respondent by remaining unauthorisedly absent for such a long period with inadequate reason and in not responding to the communications from the employer while he was unauthorisedly absent, had not only shown indiscipline but also made an attempt to get away with it - Such a conduct is not permissible - Doctrine of proportionality does not get remotely attracted to such a case - The punishment is definitely not shockingly disproportionate.Misconduct - Dismissal from service - Four years delay in filing writ petition -Held: Doctrine of delay and laches should not be lightly brushed aside - A writ court is required to weigh the explanation offered and the acceptability of the same - it should bear in mind that it is exercising an extraordinary and equitable jurisdiction - It is the duty of the court to scrutinize whether such enormous delay is to be ignored without any justification - That apart, in the instant case, such belated approach gains more significance as the respondent- employee being absolutely careless to his duty and nurturing a lackadaisical attitude to the responsibility had remained unauthorisedly absent - Such delay does not deserve any indulgence - Constitution of India, 1950 - Art. 226.

Art. 21 - Commutation of death sentence due to delay in its execution- Held: Prolonged delay in execution of death sentence, by itself, gives rise to mental suffering and agony which renders the subsequent execution of death sentence inhuman and barbaric - There is no obligation on the convict to demonstrate specific ill effects of suffering and agony on his mind and body as a prerequisite for commutation of sentence of death.

        "HeadNote": " Contempt of Court  Disobedience of court's orders - Court directing reinstatement with consequential benefits as a/so back wages - Contempt petition alleging non-compliance of order as petitioner was denied benefit of re-designated post on a higher pay scale after his compulsory retirement - Held: Contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature and, therefore, standard of proof required is beyond all reasonable doubt - If two interpretations are possible, and if the action is not contumacious, a contempt proceeding would not be maintainable - In order to punish a contemnor, it has to be established that disobedience of the order is 'wilful' - Even if there is a disobedience of an order, but such disobedience is the result of some compelling circumstances under which it was not possible for alleged contemnor to comply with the order, he cannot be punished - In the absence of any provision, the statutory authority cannot be asked to pay the salary to two persons for one post, particularly in view of the fact that the person appointed to the post had never been a party to this, nor her re-designation/promotion had ever been challenged - No case is made out to initiate contempt proceedings against respondents.  WORDS AND PHRASES: Word 'wilful' - Connotation of in the content of A proceedings for contempt of court.   "
