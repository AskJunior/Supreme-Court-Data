Evidence - Medical evidence - Appreciation of - On facts, the medical evidence adduced suggests that death of the deceased child was caused by drowning - Congestion of his lungs implies presence of excess fluids in the lungs, a sign suggesting that the child would have inhaled excess fluid while in water - Presence of watery fluid even in stomach of the deceased an important sign of death by drowning - It is almost impossible for water to get into the stomach, if a body is submerged after death - Absence of any other marks on the body of the child also supports the prosecution case that the child had indeed died of drowning.
