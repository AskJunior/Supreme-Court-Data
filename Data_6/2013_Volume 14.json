Held: This species of appeals should be consciously 0 dismissed on the ground of occasioning a gross abuse of the judicial process and an annihilation of justice - However, necessity of distinguishing dismissal of appeals in instances where steps have been taken by the Court for securing the presence of the appellant by coercive means on the one hand, and those where the appellant may incidentally and unwittingly be absent when his appeal is called on for hearing.} Bounden duty cast upon the Judge not merely to ensure that an innocent person is not punished but equally not to become a mute spectator to the spectacle of convict circumventing his conviction - It is necessary for the High Court confronted with the absence of the convict as well as his counsel to immediately proceed against the person who stood surety for bail - If this exercise fails to locate and bring forth convict, the Appellate Court is empowered u/s. 482 Cr.P.C. to dismiss the  appeal without consideration on merits - In such cases, none of the sections in Chapter XXIX Cr. P. C. dealing with appeals, precludes or dissuades the Court from dismissing appeals - Inherent powers of the High Court, poignantly preserved in s.482 CrPC, can be pressed into service but with care, caution and circumspection - In the present case, the High Court while affirming the conviction of appellant had considered the case in all its complexities - It had manifestly discussed the evidence that was led, and finding it of probative value, came to the conclusion that the conviction was above appellate reproach correction and interference - The High Court was not duty-bound to appoint an amicus curiae - No fault in the approach of the High Court which had duly undertaken the curial responsibility fastened upon the Appellate Court - However, since request for remand is rejected, and since appellant-convict was not represented c through counsel before the High Court, it is proper to permit the appellant an opportunity to argue appeal before the Supreme Court on merits- Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.482 - Abuse of Court."

        "HeadNote": "Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 - s. 11 (5) and (6) - Application under - Maintainability - Civil works relating to irrigation structures - Granted to appellant by the State Government of Andhra Pradesh - Appellant was the main contractor and respondent was the sub-contractor working under the appellant - Agreement dated 29-01-2001 entered between the two parties contained an arbitration clause - Claim of respondent that it had executed work to the satisfaction of the appellant and the State Government; but appellant having received all the amounts from the State Government failed to make corresponding payments to the respondent after deducting commission as stipulated under the agreement - Counter claim of appellant that the accounts had been reconciled and that the parties had signed a full and final settlement document on 6. 6. 2003 - Full and final settlement dated 6. 6. 2003 not accepted by respondent -  Dispute not resolved - Respondent moved application ul s. 11 (5) and (6) for appointment of Arbitrator - Plea of appellant that the application was liable to be dismissed inasmuch as agreement dated 29.1.2001 which contains the arbitration clause had been superseded by the full and final settlement agreement dated 6. 6. 2003; and respondent having received the entire amount in terms of the \"full and final settlement\" dated 6-6-2003 was estopped from filing the application u/s. 11 (5) and (6) - According to appellant, since the entire dispute had been settled, no reference could be made to arbitration - High Court, however, allowed the application u/s. 11 (5) and (6) - . On appeal, held: The question as to whether letter dated 6-6-2003 would constitute a \"full and final settlement\" would have to be determined on proper appreciation of the evidence led by the parties - It is open to two interpretations - Which of the two interpretations is  ultimately accepted will have to be decided by the appropriate forum - Appellant is relying on the alleged settlement by way of defence - Respondent has not accepted the same - Nor has the respondent denied the execution of the document - Respondent has also not claimed that the full and final  settlement was signed under coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake - Furthermore, appellant did not make any claim on the basis of the settlement - It would have been different, if the appellant had made a claim on the basis of settlement which was denied by the respondent by one or  more of the defences - In such circumstances, it would have to be held that the settlement can only be challenged in \"proper proceedings\" ..:. However, in the instant case, since there is no acceptance of the full and final settlement by the respondent which has been relied upon by the appellant, the issue clearly had to be left to the Arbitrator to be adjudicated.
