Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 - Exercise of contempt jurisdiction - Scope - Held: The power to punish for contempt is a rare specie ofjudicial power which by the very nature calls for exercise with great care and caution.

The prosecutioncase was that extra-marital relationship between A-1 andA-2 was of such a degree to disturb the mental balanceof the deceased, which amounted to cruelty within the Explanation to Section 498A IPC. It was submitted thatthe suicide note left by the deceased indicated that A-1and A-2 were in love and that A-1 wanted to marry A-2 andit was for their happiness that the deceased committedsuicide. It was alleged that due to the extra maritalrelationship, the wife of A-1 developed a feeling ofalienation, loss of companionship, etc., which ultimatelydrove her to commit suicide by leaping out of the terraceof a flat.The trial court convicted A-1 under Sections 498A IPCand 306 IPC. A-2 and A-3, the mother of A-1 were,however, acquitted of the various offences allegedagainst them. The trial Court also acquitted A-1 of theoffence charged against him under Section 304-B IPC.On appeal by A-1, the High Court confirmed the conviction of A-1 under Sections 498A IPC and 306 IPC.In the instant appeal preferred by A-1, the questionwhich arose for consideration was whether therelationship between A-1 and A-2 was extra-marital leading to cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPCand also amounted to abetment leading to the act ofsuicide by the wife of A-1 within the meaning of Section306 IPC. The question was required to be examined inlight of the fact that A-2 was already found not guilty of the charges levelled against her under Sections 498A, 306and 304-B read with Section 114 IPC."

Issue arose for consideration as to whether the Court within the jurisdiction whereof, the complainant had presented the dishonoured cheque '(Issued by an accused), had the jurisdiction to entertain a petition flied under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The High Court held that just because the dishonoured cheques In question were presented for encashment by the complainant at Delhi or the demand notice was sent from Delhi, the Courts at Deihi would not have jurisdiction to try the case. The High Court accepted the prayer made by the drawee of the cheque (I.e. the respondent) to conclude, that the Courts at Delhi did not have the jurisdiction to try the complaint filed by the appellant, under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Hence the present appeal. "
