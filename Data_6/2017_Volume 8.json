J 00 - Substantial question of law - Agreement of sale of land - Stipulation in the agreement that the seller would conduct a \u00b7survey for identification of the boundaries of the suit land - Non-  compliance by the seller - Suit for specific performance - Trial court decreed the suit - Appellate court upheld the decree - Concurrent finding of two courts that the survey was not conducted by the seller - High Court set aside the judgment on the ground that buyer was unable to prove that suit land was not measured and demarcated by the seller - High court's order challenged on the  ground that the same was beyond the scope of second appeal under s.100; that seller was not able to prove that survey was conducted which was condition precedent for payment of agreed consideration and that the buyer was ready and willing to perform his part of contract - On appeal, held: Perusal of various conditions stipulated in the agreement makes it clear that the reciprocal promises were  dependent on each other - The view taken by High Court, regarding the interpretation of the contract wherein the execution of the contract was independent of the payment obligation, is erroneous and cannot be sustained in the eyes of law as the contract needs to  be read as whole and not in piecemeal approach as undertaken bythe High Court - Therefore. the buyers payment obligation and theobligation to execute the contract, was dependent upon themeasurement to be conducted by the seller - DWl and DW2 statedthat the survey was conducted subsequent to the execution of the agreement, but no documents were marked on behalf of the sellerevidencing this fact - When both the courts below took a view thatevidence of the witness was not believable on detailed considerationof their cross examination and non-availability of documentaryevidence to prove that survey was conducted, the High Court shouldnot have interfered with such factual findings by taking intoconsideration the oral evidence of witnesses - The crucial fact thatthe survey was not conducted had attained finality by the earlierjudgement of the High Court - Therefore, once trial court and firstappellate court which are the fact finding courts have come to thespecific conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled for specific performance of the agreement of sale, the High Court on re-appreciation of evidence could not have upset the factual findingsin second appeal - Specific Relief Act, 1963.Specific Relief Act, 1963:Escalation of prices cannot be a ground for denying the reliefof specific performance - Specific performance is an equitable reliefand granting the relief is the discretion of the court - The discretionhas to be exercised by the court judicially and within the settledprinciples of law - Equity.s.l 6(c) - Essential ingredients - Proof of readiness andwillingness to perform - In a suit for specific performance, burdenis always on the plaintiff to aver and prove that they are alwaysready and willing to perform their part of the contract throughout -s.16(c) of the Act mandates that not only there be a plea of readinessand willingness but it also has to be proved by acceptable evidence- Requirement ofulfi!ling the conditions under s. l 6(c) of the Act, is a condition precedent for obtaining the relief of specificperformance."

        "HeadNote": "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: , Cl.(i) of proviso (a) to s.167(2) - Interpretation of words \"imprisonment for a term not less than ten years\" - Petitioner arrested for an offence, inter alia, uls. 13(1) of the PC Act, 1988 - Offence uls. 13(1) of the PC Act punishable with imprisonment for a term not less than four years but may extend to ten years - After ,expiry of 60 days of detention, bail application filed by the petitioner before High Court which was rejected on ground that he could be detained for 90 days - State contended that the petitioner could be kept in custody for a period of 90 days in terms of cl.(i) of proviso (a) to s.167(2) as offences committed by petitioner could result in \"imprisonment for a term not less than ten years\" - Whether the Petitioner-accused entitled to grant of bail in terms of s.167 (2) of the Cr.P.C. as the investigating agency did not file charge-sheet within 60 days - Held: Yes .:._Per Madam B. Lokur, J.: The words \"not less than\" in cl(i) would mean that the imprisonment should be 10 years or more and would cover only those offences for which punishment of imprisonment could be for a clear period of 10 years or more - If minimum sentencing is laid down by the Legislature, then the sentencing judge has no option but to give a sentence \"not less than\" that sentence provided for -; Therefore, the words \"not less than\" occurring in cl(i) to proviso (a) of s.167(2) of the code (and in other provisions) must be given their natural and obvious meaning which is to say, not below a minimum threshold and in case of s.167 of the code these words must relate to an offence punishable with a minimum of JO years imprisonment~ In instant case, alleged offence against the petitioner was not punishable with imprisonment for a minimum period of ten years - Thus, petitioner had indefeasible right to the grant of 'default bail' after expiry of sixty days of detention - Per Deepak Gupta, J, (concurring): Thewords used by the Legislature are \"not less than ten years\", thismeans that the punishment should be 10 years or more - This can-not include offences where the maximum punishment is JO years -It obviously means that minimum punishment is JO years whateverB be the maximum punishment - There is no ambiguity in the wordingof s.167(2) of the code - Per Prafu/la C. Pant, J. (dissenting) : Theintention of the Legislature was that if an offence was punishablewith imprisonment upto ten years, then it falls within the provisionof s. l 67(2)(a)(i) of the code, and permissible period forinvestigation is 90 days - Though the expression \"not less than tenyears\" used ins. J 67(2)(a)(i) of the code has created some ambiguity,the real intention of the legislature seems to include all such offenceswherein an imprisonment which may extend to ten years is an award-a bl e sentence - Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 - ss. 7,J 3(l)(a)(b)(d) and 13(2) (as amended by the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act, 2013).Default Bail - After expiry of sixty days of detention ulcl.(i)of proviso (a) to s.167(2) - Petitioner was arrested ulss. 7,13(l)(a)(b)(d} of the PC Act, 1988, which is punishable withimprisonment for a period ranging from 4 to JO years - Afterexpiry of 60 days of detention, bail application filed by the petitioner before High Court was for regular bail and not for 'default bail' uls.167(2), however, oral arguments made before the High Court werepredominantly based on u/s.167(2) - Whether petitioner entitled todefault bail uls.167(2) - Held: Per Madan B. Lokur, J.: Jn instantcase, an alleged offence against the petitioner was not punishablewith imprisonment for a minimum period of ten years - Petitionerhad orally applied for 'default bail', under these circumstances theonly course open to High Court was to enquire whether petitionerwas prepared to furnish bail and if so then grant him 'default bail'on reasonable conditions - Per Deepak Gupta, J.(concurring):Admittedly, there is no plea for 'default bail' in bail application, butHigh Court permitted arguments on the ground of grant of 'defaultbail' and no objection was raised by the counsel for the State - ifthis objection had been raised at that stage, the accused could haveeither filed fresh application for grant of 'default bail' or couldhave prayed for 'default bail' by adding an additional ground inthe existing application much before filing of charge sheet - Further. requirement is of furnishing bail, he does not have to file detailed.application and has to only aver in the application is that since 60190 days have expired and charge sheet has not been filed, he isentitled to bail and is willing to furnish bail - Per Prafulla C. Pant,J. (dissenting): Requirement of an application claiming the statutory Bright uls.167(2) of the code is a pre-requisite for the grant of bailon default - Such application has to be made before the Magistratefor enforcement of statutory right - Jn present case petitioner neversought 'default bail' before the court concerned, as such notentitled to the same.Default bail - State contended that since charge sheet was Cfiled against the petitioner. he is not entitled to 'default bail' andmust apply for regular bail - Held: Jn instant case, petitioner hadapplied for 'default bail' and availed his indefeasible right, whenno charge sheet was filed - It would have been a different matteraltogether if the petitioner had not applied for 'default bail' for Dwhatever reason - But, that is not the case insofar as the petitioner.did not give up his indefeasible right for default bail, on the contraryhe had availed of his right, which is now acknowledged andenforced - This indefeasible right cannot be defeated by filingcharge sheet after the accused has offered to furnish bail (Per. Madan B. Lokur and Deepak Gupta, JJ.)Constitution of India:Art. 21 - Personal Liberty - Held: Jn matters of personalliberty, view should not be too technical and must lean in favour ofpersonal liberty - Consequently, whether the accused makes a written application for 'default bail' or an oral application for'default bail' is of no consequence - The concerned court mustdeal with such an application by considering the statutory require-ments namely, whether the statutory period for filing charge sheetor cha/Ian has expired, whether the charge sheet or challan hasbeen filed and whether the accused is prepared to and does furnish Gbail - It is not advisable in matters of personal liberty to beritualistic and formal. (Per Madan B. Lokur. J.)Judicial Discipline:Duty of Courts - Held: Jn matters concerning personal libertyA and penal statutes, it is the obligation of the court to inform theaccused that he or she is entitled to free legal assistance as a matterof right - Equally, Court on coming to know that the accused personbefore it is entitled to 'default bail', to at least apprise him or her ofthe indefeasible right. (Per Madan B. Lokur. J.)Interpretation of Statutes:Golden rule of Interpretation - Held: Words used by thelegislature should be given their natural meaning - Normally, Courtsshould be hesitant to add words or subtract words from the statutoryprovision - An effort should always be made to read the legislative provision in such a way that there is no wastage of words and anyconstruction which makes words of the statute redundant should beavoided - Courts can either add words or subtract words or readdown the statute, but this should be done when there is ambiguity inthe language used. (Per Deepak Gupta, J.)Two meaning attributed to provision - Held: If two meaningscould be attributed to such provision then the courts must leantowards liberty and accept that interpretation of the statute, whichupholds the liberty of the citizen (Per Deepak Gupta, J.)Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 - Amendment made to,by the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act - Applicability of - Held: Itapplies to all accused charged with offences under the PC Actirrespective of the fact whether the action is initiated under theLokpal and Lokayuktas Act or any other law - Lokpal andLokayuktas Act, 2013."

        ],
        "HeadNote": "Determination of compensation - Basic principle before placing reliance on the previous award/judgment or comparable sales - High Court relied upon a judgment in which for the _acquisition of lana in the year 1999, exemplar of 1997 was relied upon - Held: The High Court passed the judgment in a blind manner - It was incumbent upon the High Court to take into consideration various transactions that were on record, entered into before the date of issuance of Notification under s.4 of the Act - High Court could not have placed an outright reliance on the decision of Swaran \u00b7 Singh's case, without considering the nature of transaction relied upon in the said decision - The land in Swaran Singh's case was situated just across the road as observed by the High Court as such it was relevant evidence but not binding - As such it could have \u00b7been. taken into consideration due lo the nearness of the area, but at the same time what was the nature of the transaction relied upon in the said case was also required to be looked into in an objective manner - Such decisions in other cases cannot be relied upon without examining the basis for determining compensation as to whether sale transaction referred to therein can be relied upon or not and what was the distance, size and also bonajide nature of transaction before such judgments/awards are relied on for deciding the subsequent cases - High Court \u00b7granted 15% cumulative increase which was not justified - Even accepting some increase annually due to development made after previous acquisition but that could not have been granted on cumulative basis but on a flat basis, that too considering subsequent' rate offered for nearby areas - Therefore, adding between 12-13% flat increase, taking base pri<;e at Ks.15601- granted in the case of Swaran Singh, the price would  come approximately to Rs.I.JO crores per acre - Further deductionin addition to deduction made in Swaran Singh s case is required tobe made towards development - it is held appropriate to deductfurther amount of Rs.15 lakhs - Thus, the compensation came toRs.95 lakhs per acre, and not Rs.1,46,09,0001- as determined by High Court - Thus, it is deemed appropriate to award Rs.95 lakhsper acre along with statutory benefits.Comparable sales - Award of compensation - Determiningfactors - The compensation cannot be determined by blindlyfollowing the previous award/judgment - it has to be consideredonly a piece of evidence not beyond that - Court has to apply the judicial mind and is not to follow the previous awards without dueconsideration of the facts and circumstances and evidence adducedin the case in question - The current value reflected by comparablesale deeds is more reliable and binding for determination ofcompensation - Jn such cases award/judgment relating to an acquisition made before 5 to 10 years cannot form the safe basisfor determining compensationComparable sales - Binding effect - Held: The award andjudgment in the case of others not being inter parties are not bindingas precedents - Recently, it is noticed that courts follow them blindly probably under the misconception of the concept of equality andfair treatment - The courts are being swayed away and this approachin the absence of and similar nature and situation of land is causingmore injustice and tantamount to giving equal treatment in the caseof unequals.Comparable sales - Evidentiary value vis-a-vis presidentialvalue - The previous awards/judgments are the only piece ofevidence at par with comparative sale transactions - The similarityof the land covered by previous judgment/award is required to beproved like any other comparative exemplar - In case previousaward/judgment is based on exemplar, which is not similar or acceptable, previous award/judgment of court cannot be said to bebinding - Such determination has to be outrightly rejected - Jncase some mistake has been done in awarding compensation, itcannot be followed on the ground of parity as an illegality cannotbe perpetuated - Such award/judgment would be wholly irrelevantComparable sales -Acquisition made JO to 12 years ago - Held: Reliance of such acquisition is made only when there isabsence of sale transaction before issuance of notification unders.4 of the Act and for giving annual increase, evidence should reflectthat price of land had appreciated regularly and did not remainstatic - The Recent trend for last several years indicates that price of land is more or less static if it has not gone down - At present,there is no appreciation of value - Thus, it is not a very safe methodof determining compensation.Award of compensation - Previous award/ judgment - Mistakeor illegality in the previous award - Jn case some gross mistake 'orillegality has been committed in previous award/judgment of not making deduction etc. and/or sufficient evidence had not beenadduced and better evidence is adduced in case at hand, previousaward/judgment being not inter-parties cannot be followed and ifland is not similar in nature in all aspects it has to be out-rightlyrejected as done in the case of comparative exemplars - Precedent. Precedent - To rely upon judgment/award in case .it does notform part of evidence recorded by reference court, an applicationunder Or.41 r.27 is to be filed to adduce evidence and if it is allowedopposite party has to be given opportunity to lead evidence inrebuttal - The award/judgment cannot be taken into consideration while hearing arguments unless they form part of evidence in thecase - Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 - Or. 41 r. 2 7.Precedent - Binding effect of - The dismissal of the specialleave petition without assigning of reason cannot be treated as a\u00b7binding precedent of Supreme Court."
