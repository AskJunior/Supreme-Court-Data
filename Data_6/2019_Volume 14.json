Interpretation of statutes \u2013 Marginal note of section \u2013 Held: It is well settled that where any ambiguity exists with regard to the interpretation of a legislative provision, the marginal note can be used in aid of construction, having regard to the object of the legislation and the mischief it seeks to remedy.

Penal Code, 1860: ss.306, 498-A \u2013 Whether when the prosecution established cruelty under Explanation (b) of s.498-A and also established that the deceased committed suicide within seven years of the marriage, the accused could also be held guilty for the offence punishable under s.306 with the aid of s.113-A of the Evidence Act \u2013 Held: Merely because an accused is found guilty of an offence punishable under s.498-A and the death occurred within a period of seven years of the marriage, the accused cannot be automatically held guilty for the offence punishable under s.306 by employing the presumption under s.113-A of the Evidence Act \u2013 Unless the prosecution establishes that some act or illegal omission by the accused drove the deceased to commit the suicide, the conviction under s.306 would not be tenable \u2013 Though the prosecution is successful in proving the case under s.498-A, the prosecution failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt that any act or omission of the accused instigated the deceased to commit suicide \u2013 There was no evidence on record to show that immediately prior to the deceased committing suicide there was a cruelty meted out to the deceased by the accused due to which the deceased had no other option than to commit the suicide \u2013 The evidence on record further showed that the time gap between the last visit of the deceased to her parents with regard to the illegal demand and the date of commission of suicide was about two months \u2013 As such, there was nothing to show a proximate nexus between the commission of suicide and the illegal demand made by the appellant \u2013 Further, the cases wherein the conviction under s.306 had been held tenable by this court, even though the charge was only under s.304B, it was found that the charge in those cases specifically stated that the deceased was driven to commit suicide on account of cruelty meted out to the deceased \u2013 However, in the instant case, the charge did not state that the deceased was driven to commit suicide on account of the harassment meted out to the deceased \u2013 It did not mention that the accused had abetted in commission of suicide by the deceased \u2013 Therefore, conviction under s.498-A is maintained and conviction under s.306 is set aside \u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.113-A.

        "HeadNote": " Sentence/Sentencing: Rape/murder of minor \u2013 Conviction based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Imposition of death sentence \u2013 Held: There is no absolute principle of law that no death sentence can be awarded in a case where conviction is based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Such a standard would be ripe for abuse by seasoned criminals who always make sure to destroy direct evidence \u2013 Further, in many cases of rape and murder of children, the victims owing to their tender age can put up no resistance \u2013 In such cases, it is extremely likely that there would be no ocular evidence \u2013 It cannot, therefore, be said that in every such case notwithstanding that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, the Court must not award capital punishment for the mere reason that the offender has not been seen committing the crime by an eye-witness \u2013 Such a reasoning, if applied uniformly and mechanically will have devastating effects on the society which is a dominant stakeholder in the administration of our criminal justice system. Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Residual doubt \u2013 This Court has increasingly become cognizant of \u2018residual doubt\u2019 in many recent cases which effectively create a higher standard of proof over and above the \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 standard used at the stage of conviction, as a safeguard against routine capital sentencing, keeping in mind the irreversibility of death.  Penal Code, 1860: ss.363, 366, 376(2)(m), 376(2)(n), 376- A, 302 and 201 \u2013 Rape and murder of minor girl \u2013 Trial court held appellant guilty of kidnapping a 13 years old girl committing rape on her and killing her by throttling and thereafter destroying evidence by throwing her half naked body in dry well \u2013 Trial court as well as High Court awarded death sentence \u2013 On appeal, held: This is a case of circumstantial evidence which is supported by ocular and medico-scientific evidence \u2013 DNA evidence using the established STR technique proved that appellant committed sexual intercourse with the deceased \u2013 Various injuries on her body along with signs of struggle proved that such crime was committed in a barbaric manner \u2013 A slipper was recovered through the appellant which was later identified as belonging to the deceased, giving finality to the circumstantial chain \u2013 The findings of kidnapping, rape, resultant death and destruction of evidence were proved beyond reasonable doubt, as evidenced by concurrent findings of the Courts below \u2013 As regards the sentencing, there were some residual doubts \u2013 A crucial witness for constructing the last seen theory, was partly inconsistent in cross-examination and quickly jumped from one statement to the other \u2013 Two other prosecution witnesses had seen the appellant feeding biscuits to the deceased one year before the incident and their long delay in reporting the same failed to inspire confidence \u2013 The mother of the deceased deposed that the wife and daughter of the appellant came to her house and demanded the return of the money which she had borrowed from them but failed to mention that she suspected the appellant of committing the crime initially \u2013 Ligature marks on the neck evidencing throttling were noted by doctors and in the postmortem report, but find no mention in the panchnama prepared by the police \u2013 Viscera samples sent for chemical testing were spoiled and hence remained unexamined \u2013 Although nails\u2019 scrappings of the accused were collected, no report was produced to show that DNA of the deceased was present \u2013 All these factors of course have no impact in formation of the chain of evidence and are wholly insufficient to create reasonable doubt to earn acquittal \u2013 However, \u2018residual doubt\u2019 as a mitigating factor would effectively raise the standard of proof for imposing the death sentence \u2013 This case falls short of the \u2018rarest of rare\u2019 cases where the death sentence alone deserves to be awarded to the appellant \u2013 Death penalty is set aside and is substituted with the life imprisonment. Penal Code, 1860: s. 376A \u2013 Conviction under \u2013 High Court while confirming death sentence observed that the girl was found bleeding due to forcible sexual intercourse - which fact, however, is not supported by medical evidence \u2013 Held: Such erroneous finding has no impact on conviction under s.376A for a bare perusal of the section shows that only the factum of death of the victim during the offence of rape is required, and such death need not be with any guilty intention or be a natural consequence of the act of rape only \u2013 It is worded broadly enough to include death by any act committed by the accused if done contemporaneously with the crime of rape \u2013 Any other interpretation would defeat the object of ensuring safety of women.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 \u2013 Bail \u2013 Consideration of bail application in economic offence \u2013 Held: Even economic offences fall under the category of \u201cgrave offence\u201d, in view of the consequences that would befall on the society in cases of financial irregularities, and in such circumstance while considering the application for bail in such matters, the Court has to deal with the same, being sensitive to the nature of allegation made against the accused \u2013 One of the circumstances to consider the gravity of the offence is the term of sentence that is prescribed for the offence the accused is alleged to have committed \u2013 Such consideration with regard to the gravity of offence is a factor which is in addition to the triple test or the tripod test that would be normally applied \u2013 However, it is not a rule that bail should be denied in every case of economic offence since there is no such bar created in the relevant enactment passed by the legislature nor does the bail jurisprudence provides so \u2013 The consideration will have to be on case to case basis on the facts involved therein and securing the presence of the accused to stand trial.

secured creditor \u2013 In the instant case, respondent no.6-Society (Karkhana) obtained credit facilities from appellant-Bank and mortgaged its properties in return \u2013 Default in repayment of loan amount \u2013 Recovery proceedings by appellant-Bank under s.13(2) against Karkhana \u2013 Owing to its poor financial condition, Karkhana issued notice to the employees to proceed on leave without pay \u2013 Representatives of the employees-respondent no.1 to 3 successfully challenged the notice before Industrial Court and obtained order whereby Karkhana was directed to pay unpaid salaries to its employees on top priority basis \u2013 Relying on the said order, respondent no.1 to 3 sought issuance of recovery certificate against Karkhana and appellant-Bank \u2013 Industrial Court held that recovery certificate for unpaid salaries of Karkhana employees could not be issued against the appellant-Bank \u2013 It also refused to issue such a certificate against the Karkhana in view of its precarious financial condition \u2013 However, Karkhana was directed to pay the unpaid salaries to the employees on top priority basis as and when the funds were available \u2013 In challenge against the order, High Court directed issuance of recovery certificate against Karkhana \u2013 Meanwhile, one of the attached properties of Karkhana was auctioned and sold by appellant-bank and proceeds appropriated by appellant-bank towards the amount due to it from Karkhana \u2013 Aggrieved by non-issuance of a recovery certificate against the appellant-bank, respondent Nos. 1 to 3 filed writ petition \u2013 During the pendency of this petition, the competent authority under the Societies Act directed liquidation of the Karkhana \u2013 Finally, High Court disposed of writ petition observing that in terms of s.50 of the MRTU & PULP Act, the recovery certificate should have been issued to the Collector for recovering the amount from the Karkhana and its Managing Director \u2013 Further, it held that upon the liquidation of the Karkhana, s.529A of the Companies Act, 1956 came into operation, thereby according employees\u2019 dues priority over all other dues in respect of the sale proceeds \u2013 In light of this, it was held that the Collector could recover the amount from the sale proceeds held in trust by appellant-Bank \u2013 Instant appeal filed against this order \u2013 Held: s.529A of the Companies Act, which gives workers\u2019 dues a priority over all other debts, cannot be applied to the instant case in view of s.167 of the Societies Act which bars applicability of Companies Act to societies registered under the Societies Act \u2013 It is clear from s.50 of the MRTU & PULP Act and s.169 of the Land Revenue Code that dues of employees in respect of which an order has been made by a Court under Chapter VI of the MRTU & PULP Act are recoverable in the same manner as arrears of land revenue \u2013 There is a material difference between arrears of land revenue due on account of land, and amounts other than arrears of land revenue but recoverable in the same manner as arrears of land \u2013 s.169(1) deals with the former category of claims and makes them a paramount charge on the land over all other claims \u2013 On the other hand, s.169(2) deals with the latter category and gives them priority only over unsecured claims \u2013 In the facts of the instant case, the recovery certificate issued under s.50 of the MRTU & PULP Act only makes employees\u2019 dues recoverable as arrears of land revenue \u2013 Thus, such employees\u2019 dues would fall under the category of claims captured by s.169(2), and can only take priority over unsecured claims \u2013 Given that s.50 of the MRTU & PULP Act falls short of expressly making the employees\u2019 dues a \u2018first charge\u2019, it cannot be said that such dues have priority over the claims of the Appellant- Bank, which is a secured creditor \u2013 Thus, under the scheme of the Land Revenue Code and the MRTU & PULP Act, the employees\u2019 dues cannot claim priority over the claim of the Appellant-Bank \u2013 At the same time, the Appellant-Bank does not enjoy any paramount charge over the sale proceeds either \u2013 Instead, as per s.13(7) of the SARFAESI Act, the sale letter and the sale certificate constitute a contract which displaces the order of distribution stipulated under the said provision \u2013 The cumulative effect of these documents is that the Appellant-Bank must pay the employees\u2019 dues out of the sale proceeds from the auctioned property \u2013 To this extent, the recovery certificate issued by the Industrial Court may be executed against the Appellant \u2013 Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act, 1960 \u2013 s.167 \u2013 Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971 \u2013 s.50 \u2013 Companies Act \u2013 s.529A. Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) \u2013 Manner of distributing the money received by the secured creditor through the sale of secured assets \u2013 s.13(4) of the SARFAESI Act allows a secured creditor to take possession of the secured assets of a borrower-in- default, including the right to transfer them by way of sale \u2013 Manner of distributing proceeds from such sale is provided under s.13(7) \u2013 In the absence of a contract to the contrary, such proceeds are held by the secured creditor in trust and are to be applied first towards payments of costs, charges, and expenses incurred with respect to the sale; second, towards dues of the secured creditor; and lastly, towards any person entitled to the residue money.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 \u2013 Bail \u2013 Grant/ Rejection of bail \u2013 Determining factors \u2013 Held: The determination of whether a case is fit for the grant of bail involves the balancing of numerous factors, among which the nature of the offence, the severity of the punishment and a prima facie view of the involvement of the accused are important \u2013 No straight jacket formula exists for courts to assess an application for the grant or rejection of bail \u2013 At the stage of assessing whether a case is fit for the grant of bail, the court is not required to enter into a detailed analysis of the evidence on record to establish beyond reasonable doubt the commission of the crime by the accused \u2013 That is a matter for trial \u2013 However, the Court is required to examine whether there is a prima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had committed the offence and on a balance of the considerations involved, the continued custody of the accused sub-serves the purpose of the criminal justice system. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 \u2013 Bail \u2013 Where bail has been granted by a lower court \u2013 Scope of interference \u2013 Held: Appellate court must be slow to interfere and ought to be guided by the principles set out for the exercise of the power to set aside bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.439 \u2013 Bail \u2013 Power of an appellate court in assessing the correctness of an order granting bail vis-a-vis application for the cancellation of bail \u2013 Determining factors \u2013 Held: The considerations that guide the power of an appellate court in assessing the correctness of an order granting bail stand on a different footing from an assessment of an application for the cancellation of bail \u2013 The correctness of an order granting bail is tested on the anvil of whether there was an improper or arbitrary exercise of the discretion in the grant of bail \u2013 The test is whether the order granting bail is perverse, illegal or unjustified \u2013 On the other hand, an application for cancellation of bail is generally examined on the anvil of the existence of supervening circumstances or violations of the conditions of bail by a person to whom bail has been granted. Judicial discipline: Reasoned/Speaking order while granting/ rejecting bail \u2013 It is a fundamental premise of open justice that factors which have weighed in the mind of the judge in the rejection or the grant of bail are recorded in the order passed \u2013 Open justice is premised on the notion that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done \u2013 The duty of judges to give reasoned decisions lies at the heart of this commitment \u2013 Questions of the grant of bail concern both liberty of individuals undergoing criminal prosecution as well as the interests of the criminal justice system in ensuring that those who commit crimes are not afforded the opportunity to obstruct justice \u2013 Judges are duty bound to explain the basis on which they have arrived at a conclusion \u2013 Where an order refusing or granting bail does not furnish the reasons that inform the decision, there is a presumption of the non-application of mind \u2013 Bail.

        "HeadNote": " Review Jurisdiction: Scope of review in criminal proceedings \u2013 Held: In criminal proceedings, the scope of review jurisdiction of Supreme Court is guided by Art.137 of the Constitution as well as Or.XL r.10 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966, which permit the Court to correct miscarriage of justice caused by an error apparent on the face of the record \u2013 Supreme Court cannot re-appreciate evidence in its entirety in the exercise of its review jurisdiction. Penal Code, 1860: s.302 \u2013 Circumstantial evidence \u2013 Conviction by courts below and upheld by Supreme Court \u2013 Review petition \u2013 Held: There is no ground for interference with any finding of the Courts with respect to the appreciation of the testimony relating to the \u201clast seen\u201d circumstance, the extra judicial confession and the motive of the petitioner \u2013 Chain of circumstances established the guilt of the petitioner beyond reasonable doubt.  Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Sentencing in case of circumstantial evidence \u2013 Though it may be a relevant consideration in sentencing that the evidence in a given case is circumstantial in nature, there is no bar on the award of the death sentence in cases based upon such evidence \u2013 In such a situation, it is upto the Court to determine whether the accused may be sentenced to death upon the strength of circumstantial evidence, given the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case, while assessing all the relevant aggravating circumstances of the crime and mitigating circumstances of the accused. Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Commutation of sentence, prayed \u2013 Held: While arriving at the conclusion that the instant case fell into the category of the rarest of rare cases, the Court took into account the premeditated nature of the crime, and its brutal and barbaric nature, observing that the same was sufficient to shock the collective conscience of the society \u2013 The Court also opined that the Petitioner was a menace to society and could not be reformed, and that lesser punishment would expose society to peril at his hands \u2013 However, the nature of the circumstantial evidence in this case amounts to a mitigating circumstance significant enough to tilt the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the Petitioner\u2019s favour \u2013 Moreover, it is also possible that the incorrect observations pertaining to deceased\u2019s facial injuries further led the Court to conclude in favour of imposing the death sentence on the Petitioner \u2013 Thus, there was a reasonable probability that this Court would have set aside the sentence of death in appeal, since the only surviving evidence against the Petitioner pertained to his motive to commit the crime, the circumstance of \u201clast seen\u201d and a solitary extra-judicial confession \u2013 In other words, it cannot be said that the punishment of life imprisonment is unquestionably foreclosed in the instant case, in spite of the gravity and barbarity of the offence \u2013 The award of the death penalty in the instant case, based on the evidence on record is not upheld \u2013 A sentence of life imprisonment simpliciter would, however, be inadequate, given the gruesome nature of the offence, and the menace posed to society at large by the Petitioner, as evinced by the conduct of the Petitioner in jail \u2013 The conduct of the Petitioner in jail was unsatisfactory, and that he was becoming aggressive and indulging in illegal activities in prison, intentionally abusing prisoners and prison staff and provoking fights with other prisoners \u2013 It is appropriate to impose a restriction on the Petitioner\u2019s right to remission \u2013 Petitioner shall, therefore, remain in prison for the remainder of his life.

Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz \u2013 Applicability of, exception \u2013 Held: The doctrine is subject to the exception i.e. when the arbitration agreement itself is impeached as being procured by fraud or deception \u2013 This exception would also apply to cases where the parties in the process of negotiation, may have entered into a draft agreement as an antecedent step prior to executing the final contract \u2013 The draft agreement would be a mere proposal to arbitrate, and not an unequivocal acceptance of the terms of the agreement \u2013 s.7 of the Contract Act, 1872 requires the acceptance of a contract to be absolute and unqualified \u2013 If an arbitration agreement is not valid or non-existent, the arbitral tribunal cannot assume jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the disputes \u2013 Appointment of an arbitrator may be refused if the arbitration agreement is not in writing, or the disputes are beyond the scope of the arbitration agreement \u2013 Article V(1)(a) of the New York Convention also states that recognition and enforcement of an award may be refused if the arbitration agreement \u2018is not valid under the law to which the parties have subjected it or, failing any indication thereon, under the law of the country where the award was made\u2019 \u2013 Arbitration law \u2013 Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s.7.

No. 242 dated 22.7.2013 \u2013 G.O. No. 242 was also challenged in Writ Petition \u2013 Disposing of the writ petitions and writ appeals, Division Bench of High Court held that reduction in pay-scale was without following principle of natural justice hence directed the State to constitute a \u2018Pay Grievance Redressal Committee\u2019 to analyse and consider the case \u2013 Appeal by the employees as well as the State to Supreme Court \u2013 Held: Recommendations of the One Man Commission were found to be anomalous \u2013 If the State government constituted the PGRC to address those anomalies, such decision by itself cannot be found to be illegal or invalid \u2013 Prescription of pay-scale and assessment in that behalf being a complex matter need to be assessed by experts\u2013 Therefore, there is no error in the impugned order directing constitution of PGRC.

Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: s.2(ia) and s.2(ix) \u2013 Adulterated and misbranded \u2013 A comparison of s.2(ia) of the 1954 Act which defines \u2018adulterated\u2019 and s.2(ix) which defines \u2018misbranded\u2019, shows that there is an overlap between the two provisions \u2013 s.2(ia)(a) includes within the definition of \u2018adulterated\u2019 a case where a food article is \u2018not of the nature, substance, or quality which it purports or is represented to be\u2019 \u2013 Whereas s.2(i)(ix)(g) includes within the definition of \u2018misbranded\u2019 the label on the package bearing any statement, design or device regarding the ingredients or the substances contained therein, which is false or misleading in any material particular; or if the package is otherwise deceptive with respect to its contents. Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: s.11 \u2013 Prior notice to the accused \u2013 Held: Under the scheme of the 1954 Act, the accused has to be given prior notice, as provided under s.11, that samples of a food article manufactured and/or sold by them have been sent for analysis, before the Public Analyst prepares report \u2013 The 1954 Act does not envisage a situation such as the present case where the sample is sent for analysis, and the Public Analyst\u2019s report is also prepared, but the marketer is informed several years later that prosecution is sought to be instituted against them \u2013 During such period, the food article being perishable in nature would most probably be incapable of being sent for re-testing to the Central Laboratory. Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: s.13(1) to (3) \u2013 Whether denial of right to get Jelly sample tested by the Central Laboratory under s.13(2) of the 1954 Act would entitled quashing of proceedings against the appellant for the offence of misbranding \u2013 What is the procedure to be followed in cases where proving misbranding requires testing of the relevant food samples but the corresponding charge of adulteration has not been made \u2013 Held: It is absurd and discriminatory for the prosecution to, on one hand, rely on the report of the Public Analyst under s.13(1) for proving the offence of \u2018misbranding\u2019, and on the other hand, claim that the accused cannot avail of their right to challenge the said report as per ss.13(2) and 13(3) because it is not a case of \u2018adulteration\u2019 \u2013 In such a scenario, the word \u2018adulterated\u2019 in s.13(2) would have to be read as including \u2018misbranded\u2019 in so far as it relates to the ingredients of the concerned food article, and the relevant clauses of s.13 have to be complied with in their entirety \u2013 Therefore, where examination of the contents/ingredients of the food article is integral to proving the offence \u2018misbranding\u2019, the procedure prescribed under ss.11 to 13 of the 1954 Act has to be complied with, regardless of whether \u2018adulteration\u2019 is alleged or not \u2013 This includes the right to obtain a second opinion from the Central Laboratory under s.13(2) \u2013 The same test would apply in respect of any other offence for which penalty is prescribed under the 1954 Act \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes. Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954: s.2(ix)(g) \u2013 Misbranding \u2013 Label on the packaging that the Jelly is \u2018sugarless\u2019 \u2013 Case of Respondents based on Public Analyst\u2019s Report that the Jelly contained \u2018sugar/sucrose\u2019 \u2013 Whether appellant was entitled to get Jelly sample tested by the Central Laboratory under s.13(2) of the 1954 Act \u2013 Held: Public Analyst\u2019s finding on whether \u2018sugar\u2019 as an ingredient is present in the Jelly sample is crucial to proving the offence of \u2018misbranding\u2019 against the Appellant \u2013 Thus, the Appellant ought to have been given opportunity to make an application under s.13(2) for a second opinion from the Central Laboratory on the contents of the Jelly sample. Interpretation of Statutes: Ambiguity in a penal statute \u2013 It is settled principle of statutory interpretation that any ambiguity in a penal statute has to be interpreted in favour of the accused.
