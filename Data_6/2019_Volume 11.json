The vacancies related to the years 2008-09, 2009-10 and2010-11. On 16.05.2013, the appellants appeared for thedepartmental examination and were declared successful.Thereafter, appointment orders for the 80% seniority-cum-meritvacancies were issued in 2012, while those for the 20 per centcompetitive exam vacancies were issued on 31 March 2014. On7.11.2013, a provisional seniority list was issued which excludedappellants. On 24.4.2017, another seniority list was issueddetermining the seniority as on 1.4.2014. The appellants claimedthat they were placed below the persons who were promotedagainst vacancies which arose after the year of vacancies againstwhich the appellants were promoted. Thereafter, State passed anorder directing to remove the appellants from the seniority listand to treat them as appointed in 2014-15. Aggrieved, appellantsfiled a writ petition. The appellants sought computation ofseniority based on the year in which their vacancies arose. Thewrit petition was allowed by the Single Judge of the High Court.However, the Division Bench of the High Court held that theclaim for seniority with reference to the date of the accrual of thevacancy will not be maintainable merely on the ground that nocompetitive examination was held in the years in which thevacancies arose. Hence, the present appeals."

Respondent no. 1 had enclosed a Draft Arbitration Agreement to appellant, wherein it has clearly stated that the arbitration would be between three parties i.e. Respondent no. 1 and respondent No. 2 as party of the first part, and appellant as party of the second part \u2013 There was implied or tacit consent by respondent No. 2 to being impleaded in the arbitral proceedings, which is evident from the conduct of the parties \u2013 Respondent No. 2 has throughout participated in the proceedings before the Committee on Disputes, before the High Court, before the Sole Arbitrator, and was represented by its separate counsel before this Court in the instant appeal \u2013 There was a clear intention of the parties to bind both Respondent no. 1, and its subsidiary- respondent No. 2to the proceedings \u2013 There can be no final resolution of the disputes, unless all three parties are joined in the arbitration \u2013 Group of Companies doctrine is invoked to join respondent No. 2 in the arbitration proceedings pending before the Sole Arbitrator \u2013 Matter remitted to the Sole Arbitrator to continue with the arbitral proceedings. Arbitration agreement \u2013 Existence of valid arbitration agreement \u2013 Held: Arbitration agreement is the written agreement between the parties, to submit their existing, or future disputes or differences, to arbitration \u2013 Valid arbitration agreement is the foundation on which the arbitral process is structured \u2013 Binding agreement for disputes to be resolved through arbitration is a sine\u0002qua-non for referring the parties to arbitration \u2013 Essential elements or attributes of an arbitration agreement is the agreement to refer their disputes or differences to arbitration, which is expressly or impliedly spelt out from a clause in an agreement, separate agreement, or documents/correspondence exchanged between the parties \u2013 If it can prima facie be shown that parties are ad idem, even though the other party may not have signed a formal contract, it cannot absolve him from the liability under the agreement \u2013 Intention of the parties must be inferred from the terms of the contract, conduct of the parties, and correspondence exchanged, to ascertain the existence of a binding contract between the parties \u2013 If the documents on record show that the parties were ad idem, and had actually reached an agreement upon all material terms, then it would be construed to be a binding contract \u2013 \u2018Arbitration agreement\u2019 must be interpreted so as to give effect to the intention of the parties, rather than to invalidate it on technicalities. Doctrines: Group of Companies Doctrine \u2013 Invocation of \u2013 Held: Group of Companies doctrine can be invoked to bind a non\u0002signatory by an arbitration agreement where the conduct of the parties evidences a clear intention of the parties to bind both the signatory as well as the non-signatory parties \u2013 Courts and tribunals have invoked this doctrine to join a non-signatory member of the group, if they are satisfied that the non-signatory company was by reference to the common intention of the parties, a necessary party to the contract \u2013 \u2018Group of Companies\u2019 doctrine indicates the implied consent to an agreement to arbitrate, in the context of modern multi-party business transactions \u2013 Doctrine provides that a non\u0002signatory may be bound by an arbitration agreement where the parent or holding company, or a member of the group of companies is a signatory to the arbitration agreement and the non-signatory entity on the group has been engaged in the negotiation or performance of the commercial contract, or made statements indicating its intention to be bound by the contract, the non-signatory will also be bound and benefitted by the relevant contracts \u2013 Circumstances are if there is a direct relationship between the party which is a signatory to the arbitration agreement; direct commonality of the subject matter; the composite nature of the transaction between the parties."

Doctrine of escheat postulates that where an individual dies intestate and does not leave behind an heir qualified to succeed to the property, the property devolves on the Government \u2013 Absence of any heir is pre\u0002condition for initiation of the proceedings for escheating of the property to the Government \u2013 In the present case, when the agnates/ other persons claiming right in the estate withdrew their objections, naturally they accepted the claim/right of the Trust, which claims through the Will \u2013 Inference has to be drawn that they have no right of claim in the properties\u2013 Further, when the appeals were pending before the Delhi High Court and the Board of Revenue involving disputed questions, the High Court ought to have directed the parties to avail efficacious alternative remedy \u2013 High Court erred in quashing the three communications and directing the State to hand over the possession of the properties to the respondents \u2013 Further, due procedure was followed as per the Escheats Act \u2013 State of Rajasthan right in treating the property as \u2018bona vacantia\u2019 and initiating proceedings under the Escheats Act \u2013 Per Banerjee, J. (Dissenting) : Doctrine of escheats postulates that where an individual dies intestate and does not leave behind any heir qualified to succeed to the property, the property devolves on the Government \u2013 An abandoned property is a property for which no claim has been made for a substantially long period, such as to raise the presumption that the property is abandoned \u2013 In the present case, there were claimants who objected to the grant of probate \u2013 Even though they withdrew the objections, that would not make any difference to their status as agates/cognates of the deceased testator \u2013 Further, judgment dismissing the probate petition is of no consequence \u2013 If a will fails, the property has to be treated as intestate, devolving upon the natural heirs in accordance with the applicable laws of succession \u2013 Dismissal of the probate case might mean that the Trust cannot lay claim to the properties but, that does not make the properties escheated properties\u2013 Unless there were complete failure of heirs, the Escheats would not be attracted \u2013 Further, the writ petition filed in 1987 had been pending in the High Court for about three decades \u2013 Once the writ petition had been entertained and kept pending, it should not be rejected on the ground of existence of alternative remedy of appeal before the Board of Revenue \u2013 Communications impugned were issued without any finding of complete failure of heirs \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 226, 296 \u2013 Hindu Succession Act, 1956 \u2013 ss.3(a), (c), 8-13, 29 & 30 \u2013 Indian Succession Act, 1925\u2013 ss.195, 276 \u2013 Doctrines \u2013 Will.

When the appeals were pending before the Delhi High Court and before the Board of Revenue involving disputed questions, the High Court ought to have directed the parties to avail efficacious alternative remedy \u2013 Per Banerjee, J. (Dissenting) High Court, having regard to the facts of the case, has discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition\u2013 Remedy of appeal availed by the Trustees was against the order of the Collector passed in 2016 almost two decades after the writ petition was filed in 1987 \u2013 Supervening circumstance of the order of the Collector and the appeal therefrom, would not justify the dismissal of the writ petition on the ground of existence of alternative remedy \u2013 High Court rightly allowed the writ petition. Rajasthan Escheats Regulation Act, 1956 \u2013 Scope and ambit of \u2013 Explained. (Per Banumathi, J.) Rajasthan Escheats Regulation Act, 1956 \u2013 ss.4, 6 \u2013 Compliance of \u2013 Discussed. (Per Banumathi, J.) Doctrines \u2013 Doctrine of escheats \u2013 Claim of escheat \u2013 Burden of proof \u2013 Held : Doctrine of escheat recognises State as paramount sovereign, in a clear case of failure of heirs \u2013 When a claim of escheat is put forward by the Government, onus to establish that a property is bona vacantia is on the Government \u2013 Burden of proof is heavy. (Per Banerjee, J.) Constitution of India \u2013 Art.296 \u2013 Power under \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Rajasthan Escheats Regulation Act, 1956. (Per Banerjee, J.)

Joseph, J.): Collector, when in the course of inquiry under s.18 of the Act, has before it, materials to show that an ostensible transfer or a partition is nothing but a sham and a person or a member of the family continues to hold the land as on the commencement day, it would be well within his powers to act as per the mandate of the Act and include the land for the purpose of calculating the ceiling limit \u2013 Collector is endowed with the powers of the civil court in the matter of both summoning and enforcing attendance of any person \u2013 He has power also to compel production of any document \u2013 In a sham transaction, be it sale or partition, though it has all the trappings of a transfer or a partition and it may be registered as such, in effect, the transferor continues to be the owner \u2013 In the instant case, the father continued to be the owner of the land as title had not passed to the two daughters by a legally valid instrument \u2013 Even crop statement of relevant time also showed the cultivation by father alone or along with daughters \u2013 The Partition was unnatural for the reason that under the extant Hindu Law, daughters were not entitled to a share and women were not entitled to partition \u2013 Thus the Partition was indeed not only unnatural but it was not intended to have effect \u2013 The property continued with the father in which case it would be property held by him even on the commencement date rendering it liable to be included in the account of the family unit \u2013 Held: In view of difference of opinion, the matter placed before the Chief Justice of India for referring the matter to larger bench \u2013 Reference to larger bench."
