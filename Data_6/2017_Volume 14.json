I holding that there was no malafides in the instant case and respondent no.I was  eligible and directing the respondent no.2 to consider the case of respondent no. I along with other eligible bids - Ultimately, award was given to respondent no.I since it quoted amount less than that of appellant - On appeal, held: The three expert committees scrutinized the tender of respondent no.I and found him ineligible  - The impugned judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court expressly stated that no malafides were involved in the instant case - Equally, while setting aside the judgment of the single judge. the Division Bench did not state that the three expert committees have arrived at a perverse conclusion - In tender matters, scope of judicial review is limited - Not having found malafides or perversity in the technical\u00b7 expert reports. any appreciation by the Court itself of technical evaluation, best left to technical experts, would be outside its ken - As a result. the single judge was correct in placing reliance on the three expert committee reports - The Division Bench.  in setting aside the said judgment. has clearly gone outside the  bounds of judicial review - Award of tender to the appellant is. restored as it is willing to match the offer of respondent no.I - Administrative law - Judicial review.
