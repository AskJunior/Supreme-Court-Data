XXXVII, r.3(5) \u2013 Summarysuit filed against appellant for recovery of Rs.64.18 lacs \u2013 Prior tofiling of summary suit, the respondent had filed criminal case unders.138 of N.I. Act for the same dues which case he had unconditionallywithdrawn \u2013 However, while the prosecution under the N.I. Act waspending, the respondent instituted the instant summary suit forRs.36.13 lacs being total sum of two dishonoured instruments withan additional claim for Rs.28.05 lacs as interest \u2013 Conditional leaveto defend was granted to appellant-defendant with a finding basedon existence of a commercial relationship \u2013 Grievance of appellantwas that under the second proviso to sub-rule 5 of r.3 of Or. XXXVII,the condition for deposit of Rs.30 lacs could not have been orderedin absence of any admissible dues and he denied any dealings withrespondents after 2011 and stated that there was no occasion forhim to issue a cheque in the year 2014 for any alleged dues of theyear 2011 \u2013 Held: According to the plaint of the respondent,commercial dealings between the parties ended on 03.06.2011 \u2013The respondent did not state any reason as to why outstandingpayment in respect of the same was made by cheque as late as01.03.2014 \u2013 Although respondent had option to institute a summarysuit at the very inception of the dispute, but it consciously opted fora prosecution under the N.I. Act which undoubtedly was a moreefficacious remedy for recovery of any specified amount of adishonoured instrument raising a presumption against the drawer,as in a summary suit the possibility of leave to defend could not becompletely ruled out, in which case the recovery gets delayed andprotracted \u2013 The court, on 29.10.2015, in the prosecution institutedby the respondent under the Act, required the respondent to filecertain additional documents because the appellant had denied theexistence of legal liability for any sum due \u2013 It was only thereafter that the summary suit was instituted on 24.11.2015 \u2013 The prosecutionunder the Act was subsequently unconditionally withdrawn on14.12.2015 \u2013 This coupled with the specific contention of theappellant, not denied by the respondent, that it had returned defectivegoods and paid the balance dues of Rs.5 lacs, the conclusion togrant leave to defend was perfectly justified \u2013 But the defence raisedby appellant in background was certainly not a sham much lessfrivolous and neither could it be called improbable \u2013 Appellant hadraised a substantial defence and genuine triable issues \u2013 The factthat there may have been commercial relations between the partieswas the ground for the institution of the summary suit but could notper se be the justification for grant of conditional leave sans properconsideration of the defence from the materials on record \u2013 Theimpugned orders granting conditional leave to defend wereunsustainable and liable to be set aside \u2013 Appellant is grantedunconditional leave to defend \u2013 Negotiable Instruments Act,1881 \u2013 s.138.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or. XXXVII \u2013 Object ofsummary suit \u2013 Grant of unconditional leave to defend \u2013Discretionary power of the court \u2013 In a summary suit, if thedefendant discloses such facts of a prima facie fair and reasonabledefence, the court may grant unconditional leave to defend \u2013 Thisnaturally concerns the subjective satisfaction of the court on thebasis of the materials that may be placed before it \u2013 However, in anappropriate case, if the court is satisfied of a plausible or probabledefence and which defence is not considered a sham or moonshine,but yet leaving certain doubts in the mind of the court, it may grantconditional leave to defend \u2013 In contradistinction to the earliersubjective satisfaction of the court, in the latter case there is anelement of discretion vested in the court \u2013 Such discretion is notabsolute but has to be judiciously exercised tempered with what isjust and proper in the facts of a particular case \u2013 The ultimateobject of a summary suit is expeditious disposal of a commercialdispute \u2013 The discretion vested in the court, therefore, requires it tomaintain the delicate balance between the respective rights andcontentions by not passing an order which may ultimately end upimpeding the speedy resolution of the dispute."

(a) of r.12(3) provides that forthe purpose of seeking evidence in the enquiry, the documents thathave to be obtained are matriculation or equivalent certificate, ifavailable; and in its absence date of birth certificate from the schoolfirst attended; and in its absence, birth certificate given by acorporation, municipal authority or panchayat \u2013 Thus, cl. (a) ofr.12(3) contains a hierarchical ordering, evident from the use of thelanguage \u201cin the absence whereof\u201d \u2013 This indicates that amatriculation or equivalent certificate is given precedence \u2013 In theinstant case, the date of birth which was forwarded in the roll ofstudents of the school where the second respondent was a studentfrom Class V to Class X was the sole basis of date of birth recordedin the matriculation certificate \u2013 The said date of birth was withoutany underlying document, as stated by the Principal in the courseof the enquiry before the JJB and, therefore, cannot be accepted as  authentic or credible \u2013 The date of birth in the school first attendedby second respondent and the transfer certificate of that schoolcontained the date of birth as 17.12.1995 which matched with thethe date of birth which was voluntarily disclosed by the secondrespondent while obtaining Aadhar card and also driving licence \u2013Once it is held that the date of birth of the second respondent is17.12.1995, he is not entitled to the claim of juvenility as on thedate of the alleged incident which took place on 18.08.2015 \u2013 Theorder passed by the Sessions Judge, confirming the decision of theJJB rejecting the claim of juvenility is accordingly maintained \u2013Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007 \u2013r.12(3)."
