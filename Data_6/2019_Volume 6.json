In other words,the accused at this stage argues for imposition of lesser sentencebased on such mitigating circumstances as brought to the noticeof the Court by him.

It is, therefore,an admitted fact that appellant No. 2 was a juvenile (he was belowthe age of 18 years, i.e., he was 17 years and 5 months) on thedate of the commission of the offence. Though this fact was neitherbrought to the notice of the Sessions Judge and nor the HighCourt and was brought to the notice of this Court for the firsttime by appellant No. 2 in this appeal, yet in the light of law laid down by this in Raju\u2019s case, appellant No. 2 is entitled to raisethis plea even in this appeal.

In the light of these,it is not necessary to hold any further inquiry. 1.4 Since appellant No.2 was a juvenile on the date ofcommission of the offence and though till date he has alreadyundergone considerable jail sentence partly as an under-trial andpartly as a convict, the impugned order qua appellant no. 2 is setaside."

In fact, the categorical assertion in the noticeserved was that the Plaintiff was ready and willing to pay thebalance sale consideration amount of Rs. 29,74,000/-. There wasno document to prove payment of Rs. 6,75,000/-, except the baldstatement of the Plaintiff. There was no any other evidence toprove that sum of Rs. 6,75,000/- was paid by the Plaintiff and onwhich date. The entire story of payment of Rs. 6,75,000/- at thetime of handing over the title documents is wholly unbelievable.The Plaintiff has not asserted such fact in the plaint or in thenotice served on 25.12.2006. The High Court erred in law inpassing a decree for recovery of the said amount only on thebasis of presumptions. The Plaintiff is not entitled to decree forrelief of specific performance, in view of the finding recorded bythe High Court itself that he was not ready and willing to performhis part of the contract. The appeal filed by the Plaintiff isdismissed whereas, that of the Defendant is allowed. Since thePlaintiff has admittedly paid a sum of Rs. 26,000/-, the Defendantis ordered to pay such amount to the Plaintiff to settleequities along with simple interest at the rate of 9 per cent perannum from the date of payment till the date of realisation."

The copy of the post-mortem report prepared by thedoctor in Nigeria has, been placed on record wherein, the causeof death is stated as \u201casphyxia secondary to strangulation\u201d. Thoughthe dead-body of the daughter of appellant was brought to Indiaon 29.01.2010 and Medical Board was constituted for conductingthe post-mortem but then, the Board found that no definite opinioncould be given regarding the time and cause of death. Theinvestigating agency, for the reasons best known to it, did notcite the said doctor, who conducted the first post-mortem inNigeria as a witness. It is also not the case on behalf of the accusedthat the copy of the post-mortem report dated 16.01.2010prepared in Nigeria was not disputed and/or he would not beseeking to cross-examine the said doctor, if he is examined as awitness in this matter. In the given set of facts and circumstances,it is evident that the testimony of the said doctor who conductedthe first post-mortem in Nigeria is germane to the questionsinvolved in this matter; and for a just decision of the case withadequate opportunity to both the parties to put forward their case,the application under Section 311 CrPC ought to have beenallowed. The peculiar facts and circumstances of the case haveeither been ignored or have been cursorily dealt by the trial courtwith the observations that the effect of non-availability of theoriginal post-mortem report would be considered at the time ofthe final disposal of the matter. In fact, the principal reasonweighing with the trial court in declining the prayer forexamination of the said witness had been that the case was pendingsince the year 2010. The High Court, on the other hand, chosenot to exercise its powers under Section 482 CrPC, with the onlyobservation that the discretion so exercised by the trial courtwas not to be interfered with. [Para 11][77-B-C]1.4 Though it is expected that the trial of a sessions caseshould proceed with reasonable expedition and pendency of sucha matter for about 8-9 years is not desirable but then, the length/duration of a case cannot displace the basic requirement ofensuring the just decision after taking all the necessary andmaterial evidence on record. In other words, the age of a case by itself, cannot be decisive of the matter when a prayer is madefor examination of a material witness. [Para 12][77-D]1.5 In the given set of facts and circumstances, where thewitness Dr. Y is residing in Nigeria, for the purpose of recordingof his statement, the trial court could have unquestionably takenrecourse to the provisions of Sections 284 and 285 CrPC so asto avoid the delay in the matter and inconvenience to the partiesand the witness. On the question of inconvenience likely to becaused in the event of summoning of the said witness fromNigeria, noticeable it is that the appellant made a prayer that thedoctor concerned being not available in the country, the ordermay be passed for taking his evidence by issuing commissionunder Sections 284 and 285 CrPC. In the instant case too, wherethe witness Dr. Y is residing in Nigeria, in order to avoidinconvenience to the witness as also to the parties, issuing ofcommission and recording his evidence through video conferencingappears to be a viable alternative; and the trial courtneed to take all the requisite steps so as to ensure that hisevidence comes on record with least inconvenience and/or burdento the parties and the witness. The trial court disposed of the application under Section311 CrPC on entirely irrelevant considerations and the High Courtalso failed to exercise its jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPCwhile overlooking and ignoring the material and relevant aspectsof the case. The impugned orders are set aside and the applicationmoved in this matter under Section 311 CrPC is allowed. Thetrial court shall now take all the necessary measures for ensuringthe examination of the witness concerned by issuing commissionand/or recording his statement through video-conferencing andshall also ensure expeditious proceedings so as to conclude thematter at the earliest."

Allowing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1.1 After the investigation is concluded and thereport is forwarded by the police to the Magistrate under Section173(2)(i) CrPC, the Magistrate may either (1) accept the reportand take cognizance of the offence and issue process, or (2) maydisagree with the report and drop the proceedings, or (3) maydirect further investigation under Section 156(3) and require thepolice to make a further report. If the Magistrate disagrees with the report and drops the proceedings, the informant is requiredto be given an opportunity to submit the protest application andthereafter, after giving an opportunity to the informant, theMagistrate may take a further decision whether to drop theproceedings against the accused or not. If the Magistrate acceptsthe objections, in that case, he may issue process and/or evenframe the charges against the accused. Having not satisfied withthe investigation on considering the report forwarded by the policeunder Section 173(2)(i) CrPC, the Magistrate may, at that stage,direct further investigation and require the police to make afurther report. However, it is required to be noted that all theaforesaid is required to be done at the pre-cognizance stage. Oncethe Magistrate takes the cognizance and, considering thematerials on record submitted along with the report forwardedby the police under Section 173(2)(i) CrPC, Magistrate inexercise of the powers under Section 227 CrPC discharges theaccused, thereafter, it will not be open for the Magistrate to suomoto order for further investigation and direct the investigatingofficer to submit the report. Such an order after discharging theaccused can be said to be made at the post-cognizance stage.There is a distinction and/or difference between the precognizancestage and post-cognizance stage and the powers tobe exercised by the Magistrate for further investigation at thepre-cognizance stage and post-cognizance stage. The power toorder further investigation which may be available to theMagistrate at the pre-cognizance stage may not be available tothe Magistrate at the post-cognizance stage, more particularly,when the accused is discharged by him. If the Magistrate wasnot satisfied with the investigation carried out by the investigatingofficer and the report submitted by the investigating officer underSection 173(2)(i) CrPC, it was always open/permissible for theMagistrate to direct the investigating agency for furtherinvestigation and may postpone even the framing of the chargeand/or taking any final decision on the report at that stage.However, once the Magistrate, on the basis of the report and thematerials placed along with the report, discharges the accused,the Court is afraid that thereafter the Magistrate can suo motoorder the further investigation by the investigating agency. Oncethe order of discharge is passed, thereafter the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to suo moto direct the investigating officer forfurther investigation and submit the report. In such a situation,only two remedies are available: (i) a revision application can befiled against the discharge or (ii) the Court has to wait till thestage of Section 319 CrPC. However, at the same time,considering the provisions of Section 173(8) CrPC, it is alwaysopen for the investigating agency to file an application for furtherinvestigation and thereafter to submit the fresh report and theCourt may, on the application submitted by the investigatingagency, permit further investigation and permit the investigatingofficer to file a fresh report and the same may be considered bythe Magistrate thereafter in accordance with law. The Magistratecannot suo moto direct for further investigation under Section173(8) CrPC or direct the re-investigation into a case at the postcognizancestage, more particularly when, in exercise of powersu/s. 227 CrPC, the Magistrate discharges the accused. However,Section 173(8) CrPC confers power upon the officer-in-charge ofthe police station to further investigate and submit evidence, oralor documentary, after forwarding the report under sub-section(2) of Section 173 of the CrPC. Therefore, it is always open forthe investigating officer to apply for further investigation, evenafter forwarding the report under sub-section (2) of Section 173and even after the discharge of the accused. In the instant case, the investigating authority did notapply for further investigation and that the Magistrate suo motopassed an order for further investigation and directed theinvestigating officer to further investigate and submit the report,which is impermissible under the law. Such a course of action isbeyond the jurisdictional competence of the Magistrate.Therefore, that part of the order passed by the Magistrateordering further investigation after he discharges the accused,cannot be sustained. Thus, the judgment and order passed bythe High Court confirming an order passed by the Magistrate isquashed and set aside. At the same time, it would always be openfor the investigating officer to file an appropriate application forfurther investigation and undertake further investigation andsubmit a further report in exercise of powers under Section 173(8)CrPC."

NARIMAN AND VINEET SARAN, JJ.]Arbitration and Conciliation, 1996: s.12(5) and its proviso \u2013Applicability of the proviso \u2013 Held: The proviso to s.12(5) appliesonly if subsequent to arising of disputes between the parties, theparties waive the applicability of sub-section (5) of s.12 by an expressagreement in writing \u2013 The expression \u201cexpress agreement inwriting\u201d refers to an agreement made in words as opposed to anagreement which is to be inferred by conduct \u2013 The instant casedisclosed no such express agreement \u2013 The fact that a statement ofclaim was filed before the arbitrator, would not mean that there wasan express agreement in words that both parties wished continuationof arbitrator so appointed despite his being ineligible to act as such.Arbitration and Conciliation, 1996: s.12(5) \u2013 Interpretationof \u2013 Eligibility to be appointed as arbitrator \u2013 In the instant case,agreement provided for appointment of arbitrator by the ManagingDirector of appellant-company \u2013 Accordingly, in terms of thearbitration clause, appointment of arbitrator was made \u2013 On3.7.2017, TRF judgment of Supreme Court held that since ManagingDirector of a company which was one of the parties to the arbitrationwas himself ineligible to act as arbitrator, such ineligible personcould not appoint an arbitrator, and any such appointment wouldbe null and void \u2013 In view of TRF judgment, in the instant case,validity of appointment of arbitrator challenged by the ManagingDirector himself \u2013 Held: In the instant case, appointment of thearbitrator was after the introduction of s.12(5) in the statute book\u2013 The Managing Director of the appellant himself could not haveacted as an arbitrator, being rendered ineligible to act as arbitratorunder Item 5 of the Seventh Schedule \u2013 The scheme of ss.12, 13and 14 was that where an arbitrator makes a disclosure in writingwhich is likely to give justifiable doubts as to his independence orimpartiality, the appointment of such arbitrator may be challenged under ss.12(1) to 12(4) r/w s.13 \u2013 However, where such personbecomes \u201cineligible\u201d to be appointed as an arbitrator, there is noquestion of challenge to such arbitrator, before such arbitrator \u2013In such a case, i.e., a case which falls under s.12(5), s.14(1)(a) ofthe Act gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as amatter of law (i.e., de jure), unable to perform his functions unders.12(5), being ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator \u2013 Thisbeing so, his mandate automatically terminates, and he shall thenbe substituted by another arbitrator under s.14(1) itself \u2013 If anarbitrator continues as such, being de jure unable to perform hisfunctions, as he falls within any of the categories mentioned ins.12(5), r/w the Seventh Schedule, a party may apply to the Court,which will then decide on whether his mandate has terminated.Allowing the appeals, the CourtHELD: 1.1 Section 12(1), as substituted by the Arbitrationand Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015 makes it clear that whena person is approached in connection with his possibleappointment as an arbitrator, it is his duty to disclose in writingany circumstances which are likely to give rise to justifiabledoubts as to his independence or impartiality. Once this is done,the appointment of the arbitrator may be challenged on the groundthat justifiable doubts have arisen under sub-section (3) of Section12 subject to the caveat entered by sub-section (4) of Section 12.The challenge procedure is then set out in Section 13, togetherwith the time limit laid down in Section 13(2). The arbitral tribunalmust first decide on the said challenge, and if it is not successful,the tribunal shall continue the proceedings and make an award.It is only post award that the party challenging the appointmentof an arbitrator may make an application for setting aside such anaward in accordance with Section 34 of the Act. [Para 14][113-E-H; 114-A-B]1.2 Section 12(5), on the other hand, is a new provisionwhich relates to the de jure inability of an arbitrator to act assuch. Under this provision, any prior agreement to the contraryis wiped out by the non-obstante clause in Section 12(5) themoment any person whose relationship with the parties or thecounsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls under theSeventh Schedule. The sub-section then declares that such person shall be \u201cineligible\u201d to be appointed as arbitrator. Theonly way in which this ineligibility can be removed is by theproviso, which again is a special provision which states that partiesmay, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waivethe applicability of Section 12(5) by an express agreement inwriting. Where, under any agreement between the parties, aperson falls within any of the categories set out in the SeventhSchedule, he is, as a matter of law, ineligible to be appointed asan arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can beremoved, again, in law, is that parties may after disputes havearisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-sectionby an \u201cexpress agreement in writing\u201d. The \u201cexpress agreementin writing\u201d has reference to a person who is interdicted by theSeventh Schedule, but who is stated by parties (after the disputeshave arisen between them) to be a person in whom they havefaith notwithstanding the fact that such person is interdicted bythe Seventh Schedule. The Law Commission Report makes it clear that thereare certain minimum levels of independence and impartiality thatshould be required of the arbitral process, regardless of theparties\u2019 agreement. Thus, it will be seen that party autonomy isto be respected only in certain exceptional situations which couldbe situations which arise in family arbitrations or other arbitrationswhere a person subjectively commands blind faith and trust ofthe parties to the dispute, despite the existence of objectivejustifiable doubts regarding his independence and impartiality.The scheme of Sections 12, 13, and 14, therefore, is that wherean arbitrator makes a disclosure in writing which is likely to givejustifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality, theappointment of such arbitrator may be challenged under Sections12(1) to 12(4) read with Section 13. However, where such personbecomes \u201cineligible\u201d to be appointed as an arbitrator, there isno question of challenge to such arbitrator, before such arbitrator.In such a case, i.e., a case which falls under Section 12(5), Section14(1)(a) of the Act gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitratorbecomes, as a matter of law (i.e., de jure), unable to perform hisfunctions under Section 12(5), being ineligible to be appointedas an arbitrator. This being so, his mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be substituted by another arbitratorunder Section 14(1) itself. It is only if a controversy occursconcerning whether he has become de jure unable to perform hisfunctions as such, that a party has to apply to the Court to decideon the termination of the mandate, unless otherwise agreed bythe parties. Thus, in all Section 12(5) cases, there is no challengeprocedure to be availed of. If an arbitrator continues as such,being de jure unable to perform his functions, as he falls withinany of the categories mentioned in Section 12(5), readwith the Seventh Schedule, a party may apply to the Court, whichwill then decide on whether his mandate has terminated. In the instant case, it is clear that the Managing Directorof the appellant could not have acted as an arbitrator himself,being rendered ineligible to act as arbitrator under Item 5 of theSeventh Schedule. Whether such ineligible person could himselfappoint another arbitrator was only made clear by this Court\u2019sjudgment in TRF Ltd. on 03.07.2017, in which it was held by thisCourt that an appointment made by an ineligible person is itselfvoid ab initio. There is no doubt in this case that disputes aroseonly after the introduction of Section 12(5) into the statute bookon 23.10.2015, and the arbitrator was appointed long after23.10.2015. The judgment in TRF Ltd. nowhere stated that itwill apply only prospectively. Section 26 of the Amendment Act,2015 makes it clear that the Amendment Act, 2015 shall apply inrelation to arbitral proceedings commenced on or after23.10.2015. The APO itself is of the year 2014, whereas theappointment by the Managing Director is after the AmendmentAct, 2015, just as in the case of TRF Ltd. Considering that theappointment in the case of TRF Ltd. of a retired Judge of thisCourt was set aside as being non-est in law, the appointment ofarbitrator in the present case must follow suit. [Para 18][116-H;117-B-G]3. Applicability of the proviso to Section 12(5) on the factsof this case.Unlike Section 4 of the Act which deals with deemed waiverof the right to object by conduct, the proviso to Section 12(5) willonly apply if subsequent to disputes having arisen between the parties, the parties waive the applicability of sub-section (5) ofSection 12 by an express agreement in writing. For this reason,the argument based on the analogy of Section 7 of the Act mustalso be rejected. Section 7 deals with arbitration agreements thatmust be in writing, and then explains that such agreements maybe contained in documents which provide a record of suchagreements. On the other hand, Section 12(5) refers to an\u201cexpress agreement in writing\u201d. It is thus necessary that therebe an \u201cexpress\u201d agreement in writing. This agreement must bean agreement by which both parties, with full knowledge of thefact that Shri Khan is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator,still go ahead and say that they have full faith and confidence inhim to continue as such. The facts of the instant case disclose nosuch express agreement. The appointment letter which is reliedupon by the High Court as indicating an express agreement onthe facts of the case is dated 17.01.2017. On this date, theManaging Director of the appellant was certainly not aware thatShri Khan could not be appointed by him as Section 12(5) readwith the Seventh Schedule only went to the invalidity of theappointment of the Managing Director himself as an arbitrator.Shri Khan\u2019s invalid appointment only became clear after thedeclaration of the law by the Supreme Court in TRF Ltd. which,was only on 03.07.2017. After this date, far from there being anexpress agreement between the parties as to the validity of ShriKhan\u2019s appointment, the appellant filed an application on07.10.2017 before the sole arbitrator, bringing the arbitrator\u2019sattention to the judgment in TRF Ltd. and asking him to declarethat he has become de jure incapable of acting as an arbitrator.The impugned judgment is not correct when it applies Section 4,Section 7, Section 12(4), Section 13(2), and Section 16(2) of theAct to the facts of the instant case, and goes on to state that theappellant cannot be allowed to raise the issue of eligibilityof an arbitrator, having itself appointed the arbitrator."

Thus, it isfound that the possession of the plot measuring 250 sq. yardshas not been handed over to the appellant as projected before this Court. The appellants cannot be deprived of a plot allottedto her merely on the basis that she has not made any grievancein respect of possession of the plot allotted on the basis oftechnicalities. Therefore, in the absence of any determination ofsuch fact and to do complete justice in terms of Article 142 of theConstitution, it is deemed appropriate to direct the Registrar ofCooperative Societies, Punjab to conduct an enquiry eitherhimself or through such officer as he may deem fit to find out;whether the appellant was allotted plot by the Administrator, andthat after such allotments having been set aside on 17.07.1984,whether fresh allotment was made to the appellant by the Society.If such allotment is found to be made, the appellant would beentitled to possession of the plot of 250 sq. yards.

Allowing the appeal, the Court HELD: 1. The High Court though admitted the second appeal by framing six substantial questions of law but did not answer any of them on merits and instead went into discussion on all other issues, which were not the subject matter of the six questions framed and allowed the second appeal as if it was deciding the first appeal. Section 100 (5) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, in express terms, provides that the second appeal shall be heard only on the substantial question(s) of law framed by the High Court under Section 100 (4) of the Code. Therefore, the High Court has to confine its inquiry to the question(s) framed and not beyond it. [Para 12][153-A-B] 3. The proviso to sub-section (5) of Section 100 of the Code also enables the respondent to raise a plea at the time of hearing that the questions framed either do not arise in the case or the questions framed are not the substantial questions of law. At the same time, the High Court has the jurisdiction to frame any additional question(s) of law but this the High Court can do by assigning the reasons. [Para 13][153-C] 4. Since the High Court failed to answer the six questions either way on their respective merits and yet proceeded to allow the second appeal, such order, is not legally sustainable and has to be set aside. The case is remanded to the High Court for deciding the second appeal, out of which this appeal arises, afresh on its merits. "

The plain language of Section 59(2) of PrisonsAct, 1894 makes it manifest that there is no requirement for layingof the Rules before the legislature prior to promulgation of theAct. No time limit for laying has been provided. The use of words\u201cas soon as\u201d coupled with the absence of any consequence fornot laying makes the provision directory and not mandatory. Rajasthan Prison Rules, 1951, under the headingRemission System, in Rule 1(e) provides that the sentence forimprisonment for life or transportation of life shall be deemed tomean imprisonment for 20 years. Sentence for imprisonment forlife or transportation of life under the Penal Code shall mean theconvict\u2019s natural life. Rule 2(e) of the Rajasthan Prisons(Shortcoming of Sentences) Rules 2006, defines shortening ofsentence to mean the reduction of that period of sentence of aprisoner which he has to serve in the prison upon a judiciallypronounced sentence as a matter of grace on the part of the Stateand as a recognition of his good behaviour in the prison.  Manifestly remission not being a matter of right, muchless upon completion of 14 years of custody, but subject to rulesframed in that regard, including complete denial of the same inspecified circumstances, as a matter of State policy, nothingprevents the State from imposing restrictions in the manner doneby Rule 8(2)(i) of Rajasthan Prisons (Shortening of Sentence)Rules, 2006 to consider claims for remission."

Under Section 386(b)(iii), in anappeal from a conviction, for enhancement of sentence, theAppellate Court can exercise the power of enhancement. TheAppellate Court in an appeal for enhancement, can enhance thesentence also. The proviso to Section 386, further, provides thatthe sentence shall not be enhanced unless the accused had anopportunity of showing cause against such enhancement.[Para 11][210-D-E]1.2 Present is a case where the High Court has enhancedthe sentence in appeal filed by the accused challenging hisconviction. The submission for the appellant that the procedureprescribed under Section 386 proviso has not been followed bythe High Court since no notice for enhancement was issued tothe appellant has not been refuted by the State. There can be nodoubt with regard to the power of the High Court to enhancethe sentence in an appropriate case. The High Court can also exercise its power under Section 401 of Cr.P.C. in an appropriatecase. Section 401 of Cr.P.C. provides for the power of revision tothe High Court. The High Court under Section 401 of Cr.P.C.can exercise any of the powers conferred on a Court of Appeal bySections 386, 390 and 391 or on a Court of Session by Section307 of Cr.P.C. The High Court could have very well exercisedpower under Section 401 of Cr.P.C. read with Section 386(b)(iii),could have enhanced the sentence but the said course ispermissible only after giving notice of enhancement. Thejudgment of the High Court in sofaras it enhanced the sentencefrom seven years to ten years is not in accordance with theprocedure prescribed. The judgment of the High Court to theextent it has enhanced the sentence from seven years to tenyears is set aside. [Paras 12, 15][210-F-H; 211-A; 213-F-G]2. The victim herself appeared as PW.1. She was thoroughlycross-examined by the accused, the evidence of victim hasproved, the charge levelled against the accused which evidencewas corroborated by evidence of PW.6 and PW.7 who were alsostudents studying in the same school and returning from theschool at the time when victim was returning from the school.The medical evidence also fully corroborated the charge on theappellant. The High Court has rightly affirmed the finding of theconviction of the appellant. There is no ground to interfere withthe finding of conviction and in fact the appellant has not veryseriously challenged the conviction of the appellant. Hissubmission was that he could have been awarded only sentenceof five years under Section 10. The Special Judge afterconsidering the factors imposed the sentence of seven years.The Special Judge has noted that the offence committed againstthe minor girl child (7 years) cannot be viewed lightly. The viewof the Special Judge is enclosed and considering the seriousnature of the offence the conviction of seven years RI need nointerference in this appeal. The submission for the appellantthat the sentence awarded ought to be reduced to five years isrejected."

        "HeadNote": "Customs Act, 1962 \u2013 s.28 \u2013 Customs Valuation (Determinationof Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 \u2013 rr. 3 to 5, 7 & 9 \u2013Appellant was a regular importer of electric decorative lightingsand in the process of such imports filed a bill of entry for clearanceof electric decorative lightings \u2013 Enquiry was initiated to ascertaincorrect value of goods for purposes of customs duty \u2013 A show causenotice was issued u/s. 28 of the Act on grounds that appellant didnot declare the brand of imported goods and he imported goodsfrom its related party (M/s. \u2018IL\u2019 Ltd., United Kingdom), andundervalued the same with the intention of evading customs duty \u2013Consequent to which, adverse order was passed against the appellantby the authorities under r.7 and r. 9 of the Rules \u2013 Appellantscontended that the scheme of rules was not correctly understoodand implemented by the competent authority \u2013 Held: Even thoughthe imports were under the brand names \u2018Diyas\u2019 and \u2018mAntra\u2019, theywere not trademarks of such nature as would make them an exclusiveproduct and there was some mix up in understanding of a trademarkprotection, as the same was compared with \u2018patented goods\u2019 \u2013Further, data was available, which could have been utilised to obtainthe pricing for imports from the United Kingdom, of identical goodsor similar goods \u2013 There was a fundamental mistake committed inthe manner of implementation of the statutory Rules \u2013 Once thestatutory Rules exist and provide for sequential implementation, theassessing authority has no option but to proceed in accordancewith those Rules, in that manner \u2013 The concerned authority choseto ignore, in the facts of the case, Rules 3 to 5 and did not proceed\u2018sequentially\u2019 \u2013 Sub-r.(4) of r.3 provides that there has to be asequential implementation of the Rules, i.e. that Rules 3 to 5 wouldhave to be exhausted first and only in the eventuality of an inabilityto apply the rules would the assessing authority proceed to impose Rules 7 to 9 \u2013 Therefore, matter remitted back to the PrincipalCommissioner of Customs to proceed afresh.Allowing the appeals, the CourtHELD: 1. In substance, there were two grounds for theshow cause notice:(a) that the appellant, knowingly, did not declare the brandof imported goods, and undervalued the same with the intent ofevading customs duty;(b) that the appellant had imported the branded goods fromits related party, and had undervalued the same to evade customsduty. [Para 2][229-C-D]2. In the context of the Rules, it is the submission of theappellant that the factual matrix of the present case shows thatthe twenty one consignments (including the one directly inquestion) were not imported from one source, but three differentsources. Out of the three different sources, the competentauthority came to the conclusion that the import from UnitedKingdom, from M/s. \u2018IL\u2019 Limited, is liable to be construed asimport from a related party. Though this is sought to be disputedby the appellants, but even assuming that to be correct, it wascontended that there were imports available from two othersources, from China and Spain. These suppliers are not found tobe related parties. Thus, the pricing from these two sources,with requisite adjustments for the distance or any other parameter,could always be taken as the transactional value for al lthe goods forming part of the twenty one consignments.[Para 12][235-G-H; 236-A-B]3. A further explanation offered on behalf of the appellants,in respect of the second aspect, i.e., non-declaration of the brand\u2018Diyas\u2019 and \u2018mAntra\u2019, pertaining to the consignments in question,was that the brands were not so well-known as to make a differenceto the value. In fact, for the import from China, the brand \u2018Diyas\u2019had been clearly mentioned. The consignments had been clearedafter physical verification. In effect, the plea was that thetwo brands really do not attract any intrinsic market value.  It is a submission that the sequential application ofRules, thus, required the valuation to be done in accordance withRules 3 to 5, before proceeding to the subsequent Rules,and it is not a case where valuation was not possible under Rules3 to 5. [Para 14][236-D]5. First taking note of the fact that electrical decorativelightings, normally, are not highly branded products, exceptionsapart. It does appear that even though the imports were underthe brand names \u2018Diyas\u2019 and \u2018mAntra\u2019, they were not trademarksof such nature as would make them an exclusive product. It alsoappears that there has been some mix up in the understanding ofa trademark protection, as the same has been compared with\u2018patented goods\u2019. Thus, data was certainly available, which couldhave been utilised to obtain the pricing for imports from the U.K.,of identical goods or similar goods. [Para 18][237-A-B]6. The irony is that if the competent authority thought thatthese were goods where trademark was of significance, it couldnot simultaneously have ignored the imports under the sametrademark, from different countries, where there were no relatedparties. Naturally, there would have to be made adjustments forthe distance from which the import was made, or the size of theconsignment, if applicable, as set out in Rules 3 to 5. There wasreally no occasion to straightaway proceed to determine thetransactional value by relying on Rules 7 to 9. There is no doubtthis principle of sequential application would apply, especially inview of sub-Rule (4) of Rule 3, which provides that there has tobe a sequential implementation of the Rules, i.e., that Rules 3 to5 would have to be exhausted first, and only in the eventuality ofan inability to apply the Rules would the assessing authorityproceed to impose Rules 7 to 9. [Para 19][237-C-E]7. The result of the aforesaid discussion is that both, theorder of the Principal Commissioner of Customs (Preventive),Customs, New Delhi, dated 30.3.2017, as well as the order of theCESTAT, dated 6.11.2017, are liable to be set aside, and thematter remitted back to the Principal Commissioner of Customs(Preventive) to proceed afresh and thus, it is Rules 3 to 5 which would have to be applied first, as it is provided for the Rules toapply \u201csequentially\u201d."

        "HeadNote": "Service Law: Removal from service \u2013 Appellant-bank officersanctioned three loans while posted in one branch and recommendedtwo loans at another branch which were ultimately classified asNon-Performing Assets \u2013 When the process of granting these loanswas scrutinised by the Bank, various procedural abnormalities werefound, which were likely to cause a loss of Rs.70.32 lakhs to theBank \u2013 Punishment of removal from service imposed on the appellant\u2013 Appellant prayed that, on parity, he should also be visited onlywith the punishment of compulsory retirement as there were two othercases of officers where also similar loss was caused on account ofthe same party and they were visited with the punishment ofcompulsory retirement \u2013 Held: Recommendation of the ChiefVigilance Officer showed that earlier the proposal was for removalfrom service for all the three officers \u2013 However, only in respect ofother two officers, it was converted into compulsory retirement \u2013The reason was stated to be the seriousness of the acts of misconductof the appellant and the fact that he was the recommending authorityin two cases and the sanctioning authority in three other cases \u2013No mala fide was proved in case of the appellant \u2013 It was foundthat there was one key person who defrauded many organisationsby proving his identity through different identity cards acquired byhim fraudulently \u2013 There was no significant difference in the conductof the three officers as would justify this differentiation in punishment\u2013 As per the counter affidavit submitted by the respondents-employer,in their own wisdom they had agreed to grant compassionateallowance to the appellant, ensuring that no financial loss issuffered by the appellant on account of removal from service \u2013Appellant was given maximum benefit under the Pension Regulations1995 dealing with compassionate allowance \u2013 Since there was nofinancial difference and the role was practically identical, there was no visible reason to not convert the punishment inflicted on theappellant from one of \u201cremoval from service\u201d to \u201ccompulsoryretirement\u201d \u2013 In the said facts & circumstances, the plea of theappel lant to convert his punishment to one of \u201ccompulsoryretirement\u201d is accepted.Administrative law: Judicial review \u2013 Quantum of punishment\u2013 Scope of judicial review \u2013 Held: The domain of the courts on theissue of quantum of punishment is very limited \u2013 It is the disciplinaryauthority or the appellate authority, which decides the nature ofpunishment keeping in mind the seriousness of the misconductcommitted \u2013 However, if the punishment is so disproportionate thatit shocks the conscience of the court, the courts are not denuded ofthe authority to interfere with the same \u2013 Normally, even in suchcases, it may be appropriate to remit the matter back forconsideration by the disciplinary/appellate authority \u2013 However,one other cause for interference can be where the plea raised is ofparity in punishment but then the pre-requisite would be that theparity has to be in the nature of charges made and held against thedelinquent employee and the conduct of the employee post theincident \u2013 Service law.Administrative law: Judicial review \u2013 Quantum of punishment\u2013 Principle of equality \u2013 When the concerned employee and codelinquentare equally placed \u2013 There has to be complete paritybetween the two not only in respect of nature of charge butsubsequent conduct as well after the service of charge sheet in thetwo cases \u2013 If co-delinquent accepted the charges, indicating remorsewith unqualified apology, lesser punishment to him would bejustifiable.Allowing the appeal, the CourtHELD: 1. It is the disciplinary authority or the appellateauthority, which decides the nature of punishment keeping in mindthe seriousness of the misconduct committed. This would notimply that if the punishment is so disproportionate that it shocksthe conscience of the court the courts are denuded of the authorityto interfere with the same. In case of the other two officers, the likely loss to theBank was assessed in the range of about Rs.77.70 lakh in thecase of one RKM and Rs.39.74 lakh in the case of VKS. Theamount is, at least, not very different from one as in the case ofRKM. However, what is more important is the role performed.RKM and VKS were both the sanctioning authorities in respectof the loans in questions and there were four loans each involvedin the case of both the officers. In the case of the appellant, hewas the sanctioning authority in three loans while he was therecommending authority in two loans. No mala fide was provedin case of the appellant. It was found that one VD was the keyperson who is a cheat and has defrauded many organisations.[Paras 10-11][245-H; 246-A-C]3. A reading of the recommendation of the Chief VigilanceOfficer shows that while earlier the proposal was for removalfrom service for all the three officers, in respect of other twoofficers it was converted into compulsory retirement while notdoing so in the case of the appellant. The rationale is stated to bethe seriousness of the acts of misconduct of the appellant andthe fact that he was the recommending authority in two cases andthe sanctioning authority in three other cases. However, the realreason was that while the other two officers were provident fundoptees, the appel lant was a pension optee. There was nodifference in the conduct of the three officers as would justifythis differentiation in punishment. Once there is no financialdifference and the role is practically identical, there was no reasonfor the respondents to not convert the punishment inflicted onthe appellant from one of \u201cremoval from service to \u201ccompulsoryretirement.\u201d"

The prosecution has relied upon the statementof complainant PW-3 as also the statement of PW-4 who areinjured witnesses. PW-2, the doctor has been examined to provethe injuries on prosecution witnesses. It is statement of PW 3which led to lodging of First Information Report that the appellantswho were 7 to 8 in number challenged the witnesses. Theappellants were having spear, accused was having axe and otherswere having sticks. They attacked the deceased and both theinjured witnesses with spears and axe. [Paras 12, 13][254-F-H]2. The appellants have lodged cross First InformationReport. There is no evidence on the part of the appellants thatthe deceased were armed with any weapon in the first version,when they lodged report. The right of private defence is not available when the alleged assailants are unarmed. The right ofprivate defence is to protect the person and the property. In suchright, the person cannot cause more harm than what is necessaryfor the protection of the person and the property. What harm canbe expected from the hands of the deceased when they were unarmed,whereas from the testimony of PW-3 and PW-4, the injuredwitnesses, the appellants were armed with spears and otherweapons. The Post-Mortem report corroborates an oraltestimony that both the deceased have received stab wounds.Therefore, the appellants cannot be said to have acted in theright of their private defence. Since the deceased were not armed,therefore, the appellants are not entitled to the right of privatedefence. [Paras 15, 17][255-A-D; 256-A]Jangir Singh v. State of Punjab 2018 (15) SCALE 88\u2013 distinguished.3. Since there are multiple wounds on the chest of thedeceased, it cannot be said that the appellants have acted at thespur of the moment without pre-meditation and that the appellantshave not taken any advantage or acted in a cruel or unusualmanner. It is not a case of single injury which one can infer onaccount of sudden fight. Therefore, the appellants are not entitledto be convicted under Section 304 IPC as they have given multipleinjuries on the vital parts of the deceased. The Trial Court aswell as the High Court was perfectly justified in law in convictingand sentencing the appellants for the offence under Section 302IPC."

P-69 is concerned, itcannot be relied upon as corroborative piece of evidence to holdthat part payment was made by father of respondents and that partiestreated Ex.P-73 as \u2018mortgage by conditional sale\u2019 \u2013 Therefore, theJudgment of the High Court is set aside \u2013 Judgment of the trialcourt restored \u2013 Transfer of Property Act, 1882 \u2013 s.58(c).Allowing the appeals, the CourtHELD: 1. By perusal of Ex.P-73, it is clear that eight daysprior to Ex.P-73, father of respondents-plaintiffs has borrowedorally a sum of Rs.700/- for the purpose of marriage of hisdaughter. At the time of execution of Ex.P-73 (28.07.1967), fatherof respondents-plaintiffs required more money for the samereason and he executed Ex.P-73-document titled as \u201cmortgageby conditional sale\u201d for a consideration of Rs.2500/- and on thedate of execution of the said document, father of respondentsplaintiffsreceived only a sum of Rs.1800/-. The earlier borrowedamount of Rs.700/- was thus adjusted from the sale considerationof Rs.2500/-. The intention of the parties in putting an end to thedebtor-creditor relationship with respect to the sum ofRs.700/- is clear from the recitals of the document i.e. adjustmentof Rs.700/- from the total consideration of Rs.2500/- and partiesintending to create a relationship of vendor and vendee by transferof the suit property for a consideration of Rs.2500/-. Period offive years was fixed in Ex.P-73 within which father of therespondents-plaintiffs was to repay the said amount. On the dateof execution of the document (Ex.P-73), the possession of the property was handed over to the appellants-defendants forcultivation. Further, recitals are to the effect that if theconsideration amount is paid within five years, father ofrespondents-executant will get the mortgage redeemed. In case,the amount is not paid within the stipulated period of five years,the mortgage shall be treated as an absolute sale and thereafterpredecessor-in-interest of the appellants-defendants to pay theland revenue to the government and all other charges for whichexecutant will have no complaint. The recitals of the documentmake clear the intention of the parties that if the amount is notrepaid within the stipulated period of five years, the transfereewill have absolute right and the mortgage will be treated as anabsolute sale and the transferee to pay the land revenue and theother charges. These clauses in Ex.P-73 are consistent with theintention of the parties making the transaction a conditional salewith an option to repurchase. [Para 16][269-B-G]2. Mention of \u201cborrowed a sum of Rs.700/-\u201d in the documentis incidental. Mere incorporation of the word \u201cborrowed\u201d and\u201cmortgage by conditional sale\u201d cannot by itself establish that thereis a debtor-creditor relationship. In fact, as pointed out earlier,the recitals of the document make it clear that the partiesexpressed their intention to put an end to the debtor-creditorrelationship with respect to the sum of Rs.700/- that existed priorto the execution of Ex.P-73 and creating a relationship of vendorand vendee by transfer of the suit property for consideration ofRs.2500/-. As rightly observed by the trial court, in Ex.P-73,there is no mention of the rate of interest, right of foreclosurethat are essential in a deed of mortgage. [Para 18][270-D-E]3. Insofar as Ex.P-69-receipt is concerned, the trial courtpointed out that though PW-1 claims that he was present at thetime of execution of Ex.P-69, PW-1 had not signed in it norattested it, so PW-1\u2019s evidence is of no help to prove the executionof the receipt. Be it noted that though Ex.P-69-receipt was ofthe year 1972, during his life time, based on Ex.P-69-receipt,father of respondents-plaintiffs had not taken any step to redeemthe property. Even after the death of father of respondentsplaintiffsin 1973, Ex.P-69-receipt did not see the light of the daytill 1980 when the notice was said to have been issued by the respondents-plaintiffs. In these factual circumstances, it cannotbe said that the plaintiffs have discharged the burden in provingEx.P-69-receipt as genuine to hold that the parties had intendedthat Ex.P-73-document is only a \u201cmortgage by conditional sale\u201dand not a sale with condition to repurchase. The receipt Ex.P-69cannot be relied upon as corroborative piece of evidence to holdthat part payment was made by father of respondents-plaintiffsand that the parties treated Ex.P-73 as a \u201cmortgage by conditionalsale\u201d. [Para 25][273-C-E]4. Though the transaction and condition to repurchase areembodied in one document, having regard to the intention of theparties and the surrounding circumstances, Ex.P-73 does not fallwithin the proviso to Section 58(c) of the Transfer of PropertyAct. Ex.P-73 a registered document, is not a mortgage but atransaction of sale with condition to repurchase. The High Courtand the first Appellate Court did not properly appreciate therecitals in Ex.P-73 and that it does not create expressly or byimplication the relationship of debtor and creditor. The High Courtfailed to note that since father of respondents-plaintiffs failed topay the amount within the stipulated period of five years, therespondents-plaintiffs have lost their right to repurchase theproperty. When the findings of the first Appellate Court and theHigh Court though concurrent, where they are shown to beperverse, this Court would certainly interfere with the findingsof fact recorded by the courts below. The High Court has notproperly appreciated the evidence and Ex.P-73 in the light of thesurrounding circumstances and the impugned judgment is liableto be set aside."

Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 ss.35A, 35AA and 35AB \u2013Scheme of \u2013 Held: When it comes to issuing directions to initiate theinsolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and BankruptcyCode, 2016, s.35AA is the only source of power \u2013 When it comes toissuing directions in respect of stressed assets, which directions aredirections other than resolving this problem under the InsolvencyCode, such power falls within s.35A r/w. s.35AB \u2013 This also becomesclear from the fact that s.35AB(2) enables the RBI to specify one ormore authorities or committees to advise any banking company onresolution of stressed assets \u2013 This advice is obviously de hors theInsolvency Code, as once an applicat ion is made under theInsolvency Code, such advice would be wholly redundant, as theInsolvency Code provisions would then take over and have to befollowed \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016."

Two months later hesubmitted proposal for life insurance policy of the appellantinsurancecompany and in the proposal form, on the query as towhether the proposer was currently insured or had applied for lifeinsurance cover, his answer was in negative \u2013 Appellant issued apolicy to him \u2013 After about a year he died \u2013 Appellant repudiatedthe claim of respondent on the ground of suppression of materialfact relating to details of life insurance policies held by her husband\u2013 Consumer complaint by respondent \u2013 Held: s.45 curtails thecommon law rights of the insurer after lapse of two years from thedate the cover for life insurance was effected \u2013 However, therepudiation in the instant case was within a period of two yearsfrom the commencement of the insurance cover \u2013 The contracts ofinsurance are governed by the principle of utmost good faith \u2013 Theduty of mutual fair dealing requires all parties to a contract to befair and open with each other to create and maintain trust betweenthem \u2013 The duty of full disclosure requires that no information ofsubstance or of interest to the insurer is omitted or concealed \u2013Whether or not the insurer would have issued a life insurance coverdespite the earlier cover of insurance is a decision which wasrequired to be taken by the insurer after duly considering all relevantfacts and circumstances \u2013 Prior to undertaking the risk, thisinformation could potentially allow the insurer to question as towhy the insured had in such a short span of time obtained twodifferent life insurance policies \u2013 Such a fact is sufficient to put theinsurer to enquiry \u2013 The information which was sought by the insurerwas indeed material to its decision as to whether or not to undertake a risk \u2013 The proposer was aware of the fact, while making adeclaration, that if any statements were untrue or inaccurate or ifany matter material to the proposal was not disclosed, the insurermay cancel the contract and forfeit the premium \u2013 The failure of theinsured to disclose the policy of insurance obtained earlier in theproposal form entitled the insurer to repudiate the claim under thepolicy \u2013 Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority(Protection of Policyholders\u2019 Interests) Regulations 2002 \u2013 Regn2(d).Insurance Act 1932: s.45 \u2013 Repudiation of policy of lifeinsurance \u2013 Limitation period \u2013 Held: s.45 stipulates restrictionsupon the insurer calling into question a policy of life insuranceafter the expiry of two years from the date on which it was effected\u2013 Beyond two years, the burden lies on the insurer to establish theinaccuracy or falsity of a statement on a material matter or thesuppression of material facts \u2013 In addition to this requirement, theinsurer has to establish that this non-disclosure or, as the case maybe, the submission of inaccurate or false information wasfraudulently made and that the policy holder while making it knewof the falsity of the statement or of the suppression of facts whichwere material to disclose \u2013 s.45 curtails the common law rights ofthe insurer after two years have elapsed since the cover for lifeinsurance was effected.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of uberrima fidei \u2013 Insuranceis governed by the doctrine of uberrima fidei \u2013 This postulates thatthere must be complete good faith on the part of the insured \u2013 Therelationship between an insurer and the insured is recognized asone where mutual obligations of trust and good faith are paramount\u2013 In a contract of insurance, the insured can be expected to haveinformation of which she/he has knowledge \u2013 This justifies a dutyof good faith, leading to a positive duty of disclosure \u2013 Insurance.Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protectionof Policyholders\u2019 Interests) Regulations 2002: Regn 2(d) \u2013 Proposalform \u2013 Held: Regn 2(d) specifically defines the expression \u201cproposalform\u201d as a form which is filled by a proposer for insurance to furnishall material information required by the insurer in respect of a risk\u2013 The purpose of the disclosure is to enable the insurer to decidewhether to accept or decline to undertake a risk \u2013 The disclosures are also intended to enable the insurer, in the event that the risk isaccepted, to determine the rates, terms and conditions on which acover is to be granted.Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protectionof Policyholders\u2019 Interests) Regulations

the contextof an insurance policy can be defined as any contingency or eventthat may have an impact upon the risk appetite or willingness of theinsurer to provide insurance cover \u2013 In a contract of insurance,any fact which would influence the mind of a prudent insurer indeciding whether to accept or not accept the risk is a material fact\u2013 If the proposer has knowledge of such fact, she or he is obligedto disclose it particularly while answering questions in the proposalform.Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Protectionof Policyholders\u2019 Interests) Regulations 2002: Regn 2(d) \u2013Consequence of inaccurate answer in the proposal form \u2013 Held:An inaccurate answer will entitle the insurer to repudiate becausethere is a presumption that information sought in the proposal formis material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurance\u2013 In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrantstruth \u2013 The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression,untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will beconsidered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render thepolicy voidable by the insurer \u2013 The finding of a materialmisrepresentation or concealment in insurance has a significanteffect upon both the insured and the insurer in the event of a dispute\u2013 In the instant case, the insurer had sought information with respectto previous insurance policies obtained by the insured \u2013 Thedisclosure of the earlier cover was material to an assessment of therisk which was being undertaken by the insurer \u2013 Prior toundertaking the risk, this information could potentially allow theinsurer to question as to why the insured had in such a short spanof time obtained two different life insurance policies \u2013 Such a fact was sufficient to put the insurer to enquiry \u2013 The information whichwas sought by the insurer was indeed material to its decision as towhether or not to undertake a risk.Insurance: Plea of ignorance of contents of proposal form \u2013Held: Proposer is not absolved of the consequence of appendinghis signatures to the proposal on the submission that he was unawareof the contents of the form that he was required to fill up \u2013 In theinstant case, the proposer duly appended his signature to theproposal form and the grant of the insurance cover was on thebasis of the statements contained in the proposal form \u2013 Barely twomonths before the contract of insurance was entered into with theappellant, the insured had obtained another insurance cover forhis life in the sum of Rs 11 lakhs \u2013 The failure of the insured todisclose the policy of insurance obtained earlier in the proposalform entitled the insurer to repudiate the claim under the policy \u2013The argument of the respondent that the signatures of the assuredon the form were taken without explaining the details is notacceptable."
