(Per majority) Art.213 - Promulgation of Ordinances during recess of legislature - Requirement under - Held: The authority which is conferred upon the Governor to promulgate Ordinances isconditioned by two requirements - The first is that an Ordinance A can be promulgated only when the state legislature is not in session - The second requirement is that the Governor. before issuing an Ordinance has to be satisfied of the existence of circumstances rendering it necessary to take immediate action - The Governor is required to form a satisfaction of the existence of circumstances 'i3 which makes it necessary to take immediate action - Necessity is distinguished from a mere desirability - The expression \"necessity,. coupled with \"immediate action\" conveys the sense that it is imperative due to an emergent situation to promulgate an Ordinance during the period when the legislature is not in session - Both these requirements indicate a constitutional intent to confine the power C of the Governor to frame Ordinances within clearly mandated limits. (Per majority) Art.213(1) - Circumstances in which the Governor cannot promulgate an Ordinance without the instructions of the President - The three situations where the instructions of the President are D required are: Where a Bill containing the same provisions requires the previous sanction of the President, for its introduction into the legislature; where a Bill containing the same provisions would be deemed necessary by the Governor for being reserved for consideration of the President; and where a law enacted by the state legislature containing the same provisions would require the E assent of the President, failing which it would be invalid. (Per majority) Art.213 - Requirement of laying an Ordinance before the state legislature is mandatory- The expression \"shall be laid\" is a positive mandate which brooks no exceptions - That the word 'shall' in sub-clause (a) of clause 2 of Art. 213 is mandatory, emerges from reading the provision in its entirety. (Per majority) F Art.213 - Tenure of an Ordinance - Though the Constitution contemplates that an Ordinance shall have the same force and effect qs a law enacted by the state legislature, this is subject to the G Ordinance being laid before the state legislature and coming to an end in the manner stipulated in sub-clauses (a) and (b) - It is brought to an end : By the Ordinance ceasing to operate upon the expiry of a period of six weeks of the reassembly of the legislature; or if the Ordinance is disapproved by a resolution of the state legislature inwhich event it ceases to operate on the resolution disapproving it being passed; or in the event of the Ordinance being withdrawn by the Governor. (Per majority) Art.163 - Governor acts on aid and advice of Council of Ministers - Governor while promulgating an Ordinance does not constitute an independent legislature, but acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers under Art.163- The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the elected legislative body to whom the government is accountable. (Per majority) Arts.123, 213 - Ordinance making power - Constitutional c control of Parliament and the state legislatures over the Ordinance making power of the President (under Art.123) and the Governors (under Art.213) is a necessary concomitant to the supremacy of a democratically elected legislature - The reassembling of the legislature defines the outer limit for the validity of the Ordinance promulgated during its absence in session - Within that period, a D legislature has authority to disapprove the Ordinance - The requirement of laying an Ordinance before the legislative body subserves the constitutional purpose of ensuring that the provisions of the Ordinance are debated upon and discussed in the legislature - The legislature has before it a full panoply of legislative powers E and as an incident of those powers, the express constitutional authority to disapprove an Ordinance - If an Ordinance has to continue beyond the tenure which is prescribed by Art.213(2)(a), a law has to be enacted by the legislature incorporating its provisions - Our Constitution does not provide that an Ordinance shall assume the character of a law enacted by the state legislature merely upon F the passing of a resolution approving it. (Per majority) Arts.123, 213 - Significance of placing tabling the Ordinance - Held: The placement of an Ordinance before the legislature is a constitutional necessizv; the under~ving object and rationale being to enable the legislature to determine (i) the need for and expediency G of an ordinance; (ii) whether a law should be enacted: or (iii) whether the Ordinance should be disapproved. (Per majority) Art.213 - Failure to lay an Ordinance before the legislature - Impact of - Held: The failure to lay an Ordinance before the state legislature constitutes a serious infraction of the constitutionalobligation imposed by Art.213(2) - Requirement of laying an A Ordinance before the state legislature is a mandatory obligation . and is not merely of a directory nature. (Per majority) Art.213 - Failure to lay an ordinance before the legislature amounts to an abuse of the constitutional process and is a serious dereliction of the constitutional obligation - Jn the case of delegated legislation, Parliamentary or state enactments may provide a requirement of laying subordinate legislation before the legislature - It is well-settled that a requirement of merely laying subordinate legislation before the House of the legislature is directory _: But where a disapproval of subordinate legislation is contemplated, such a requirement is mandatory. (Per majority) B c Arts.123, 213 - Presidential/Governor satisfaction - Scope of - Held: The constitutional power which has been conferred upon the President under Art. 123 and upon the Governors under Art.213 to promulgate ordinances is conditional - Apart from the condition that the power can be exercised only when the legislature is not in D session, the power is subject to the satisfaction of the President (under Art.123) or the Governor (under Art.213) \"'that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action. \" (Per majority) Arts.123, 213 - Presidential/Governor satisfaction - Judicial E review, scope - The satisfaction of the President under Art.123(1) or of the Governor under Art.213(1) is not immune from judicial review - The power of promulgating ordinances is not an absolute entrustment but conditional upon a satisfaction that circumstances exist rendering it necessary to take immediate action - Since the F duty to arrive at the satisfaction rests in the President and the Governors (though it is exercisable on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers), the Court must act with circumspection when the satisfaction under Art.123 or Art.213 is challenged - The court will not enquire into the adequacy, or sufficiency of the material before the President or the Governor - The court will not interfere G if tbere is some material which is relevant to his satisfaction - The interference of the court can arise in a case involving a fraud on power or an abuse of power - This essentially involves a situation where the power has been exercised to secure an oblique purpose - In exercising the power of judicial review, the court must be mindfuoth of its inherent limitations as well as of the entrustment of the power to the head of the executive who acts on the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers owing collective responsibility to the elected legislature - In other words, it is on(v where the court finds that the exercise of power is based on extraneous grounds and amounts to no satisfaction at all that the interference of the court B may be warranted in a rare case - However, absolute immunity from judicial review cannot be supported as a matter of first principle (Per majority) or on the basis of constitutional history. A Arts.I23, 213 - Re-promulgation of an Ordinance - Constitutionality of - Held: Re-promulgation of ordinances is c constitutionally impermissible since it represents an effort to overreach the legislative body which is a primary source of law making authority in a parliamentary democracy - Re-promulgation defeats the constitutional scheme under which a limited power to frame ordinances has been conferred upon the President and the D Governors - The danger of re-promulgation lies in the threat which it poses to the sovereignty of Parliament and the state legislatures which have been constituted as primary law givers under the Constitution - Open legislative debate and discussion provides sunshine which separates secrecy of ordinance making from transparent and accountable governance through law making.(Per E majority) F G H Art.213(2)(a) and (b) - Expression \"cease to operate\" in Art.2I 3(2)(a) - When attracted - Held: Is attracted in two situations - The first is where a period of six weeks has expired since the reassembling of the legislature - The second situation is where a resolution has been passed by the legislature disapproving of an ordinance - Apart from these two situations that are contemplated by sub-clause (a), sub-clause (b) contemplates that an ordinance may be withdrawn at any time by the Governor - Upon its withdrawal the ordinance would cease to operate as well. (Per majority) Art.213 - Consequence of an ordinance terminating on the expiry of a period of six weeks or, within that period, on a disapproval by the legislature - Held: The constitutional provision states that,.in both situations the ordinance ceases to operate - Where an ordinance has ceased to operate, would it result ipso Jure in a revival of the state of affairs which existed before the ordinancewas promulgated - There are two constructions which need to be analysed - At one end of the spectrum is the view that once the legislature has expressed its disapproval by a resolution, the state of affairs which the ordinance brought about stands dissolved and that which existed on the eve of the ordinance stands revived - Jn this view, disapproval amounts to an obliteration of the effect of all that had transpired in the meantime -At the other end of the spectrum is the view that an ordinance upon being promulgated has the force and effect of a law enacted by the legislature - Hence, the lapsing of its term (on the expiry of six weeks or the passing of a resolution of disapproval)means that the ordinance ceases to operate from that date - Until the ordinance ceases to operate, it continues to have the force of law with the result that the enduring effects of an ordinance or consequences which have a permanent character may subsist beyond the life of 'the' ordinance - Alternatively, where a situation has been altered irreversibly in pursuance of the legal authority created by the ordinance, the clock cannot be set back to revive the state of affairs as it existed prior to the promulgation of the ordinance. (Per majority) A B C D Ordinance and temporary enactment - Distinction between - ls Ordinance a temporary enactment - Held: A temporary Act is a law which is enacted by the legislature, Parliament or the state legislature in exercise of its plenary powers - While enacting a law. E the\u00b7 legislature is entitled to define the period during which the law is intended to operate - The legislature decides whether the law will be for a limited duration or is to be permanent - An ordinance is not in the nature of a temporary enactment - An ordinance is conditioned by specific requirements - The authority to promulgate F an ordinance arises only when the legislature is not in session and when circumstances requiring emergent action exist - The Constitution prescribes. that an ordinance shall remain valid ior a period of not more than six weeks after the legislature reassembles and even within that period, it will cease to operate if it is disapproved - Hence, the considerations which govern law making by a G competent legislature which has plenary powers to enact a law cannot be equated with a temporary enactment. (Per majority) . Art.213 - Cease to operate - Connotation of in the context 'of Art.213 - Held: The Constitution has in its provisions used differenthrases including \"repeal\", \"void\", \u00b7\u00b7cease to have effect\" and \"cease to operate\" - These phrases have different connotations: each cannot be equated with the other - Consequently, the court should be careful to not attribute to the expression \"cease to operate\" the same meaning as the expression \"void\" - This is of B particular significance because clause 3 of Art.213 uses the expression \"void\" in relation to an ordinance which makes a provision which would not be valid if enacted in an act of the legislature of the state assented to by the Governor - Such a provision contained in an ordinance is declared to be void by clause 3 of Art.213 - Evidently, when the framers wished to indicate that a C provision of an ordinance would be void in a certain eventuality, the Constitution has expressly used that phrase - This would militate against equating the expression \"cease to operate\" with the expression \"void\" - Both have distinct connotations - Particularly, where the same constitutional article has used both phrases - 'cease to operate' (in clause 2) and 'void' in (clause 3) one cannot be read D to have the same meaning as the other. (Per majority) A Art.213 - Expression \"cease to operate\"- Connotation of - Held: The expression \"cease to operate\" in Art.213(2)(a) applies both to an ordinance whose tenure expires after the prescribed period as well as in relation to an ordinance which is disapproved E by the legislature - The content of the expression cannot hence mean two separate things in relation to the two situations. (Per majority) Power to frame ordinances - Enduring rights theory - Applicability of - Held: The theory which was accepted in the F judgment in Bhupendra Kumar Bose cannot be applied to the power to frame ordinances - Acceptance of the doctrine of enduring rights in the context of an ordinance would lead to a situation where the exercise of power by the Governor would survive in terms of the creation of rights and privileges, obligations and liabilities on the G hypothesis that these are of an enduring character - The enduring rights theory attributes a degree of permanence to the power to promulgate ordinances in derogation of parliamentary control and supremacy - .Doctrines/Principles. (Per majority) Law making power - Ordinance and subordinate legislation H - Requirement of an ordinance being laid before the legislaturecannot be equated with the laying of subordinate legislation - Held: A An ordinance is made in the exercise of the legislative power of the Governor which is subordinate to and not a stream which runs parallel to the power of law making which vests in the state legislatures and Parliament - Any breach of the constitutional requirement of laying an ordinance before the legislature has to be B looked upon with grave constitutional disfavour - The Constitution uses the express \"cease to operate\" in the context of a culmination of a duration of six weeks of the reassembling of the legislature or as a result of a resolution of disapproval - The framers introduced a mandatory requirement of an ordinance being laid before the legislature upon which it would have the same force and effect as a c law enacted by the legislature, subject the condition that it would cease to operate upon the expiry of a period of six weeks of the reassembling of the legislature or earlier, if a resolution of disapproval were to be passed. (Per majority) Rights, privileges, obligations and liabilities arisen under an D ordinance - Effect on, when ordinance ceased to operate - Held: In determining the issue, the over arching consideration must be the element of public interest or constitutional necessity - In deciding to mould the relief the effort of the court would be to determine whether undoing what has been done under the ordinance would manifestly be contrary to public interest - Impracticality and E irreversibility in that sense are aspects which are subsumed in the considerations which weigh in the balance while deciding where public interest lies - The appropriate test to be applied is the test of public interest and constitutional necessi(v - This would include the issue as to whether the consequences which have taken place F under the Ordinance have assumed an irreversible character - In a suitable case, it would be open to the court to mould the relief (Per majority) Scope of the Ordinance making power - Historical evolution - England, British India and Constituent Assembly - Discussed. (Per majority) G Art.213(2) - It is not mandatory under Art.213(2) to lay an Ordinance before the Legislative Assembly of the State Legislature, nor would the failure to do so result in the Ordinance not having the force and effect as an enacted law or being of no conseqliencewhatsoever - When an Ordinance is promulgated it is printed in the Official Gazette and therefore every legislator is aware of its promulgation - Consequently, even if the Executive does not lay the Ordinance before the State Legislature or if tlie Secretary of the Legislative Assembly does not supply a printed copy of the B Ordinance, a Member of the Legislative Assembly is not helpless - His right to move a Resolution for disapproving the Ordinance cannot be taken away by this subterji1ge - This right of a Member of the Legislative Assembly cannot be made dependent on the Executive laying the Ordinance before the State Legislature, nor can this right be taken away by the Executive by simply not laying C the Ordinance before the Legislative Assembly - Therefore, even without making the laying of an Ordinance before the State Legislature mandatory, the Constitution does provide adequate checks and balances against a possible misuse of power by the Executive. (Dissenting view) (Per Madan B.Lokur, J.) Art.213 - Re-promulgation of an Ordinance by the Governor. of a State is not per se a fraud on the Constitution - There could be exigencies requiring the re-promulgation of an Ordinance - However, re-promulgation of an Ordinance ought not to be a mechanical exercise and a responsibility rests on the Governor to be satisfied that \"circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action\" for promulgating or re-promulgating an Ordinance. (Dissenting view) (Per Madan B.Lokur, J.) Art.213 - In the absence of any challenge by the employees to the first three Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the State of Bihar, their validity must be assumed - Consequently, even F though first three Ordinances may have been repealed, the employees would be entitled to the benefits under them till they ceased to operate and the benefits obtained by the employees under these three Ordinances are justified - However, first three Ordinances do not confer any enduring or irreversible right or benefits on the G employees - The promulgation of the fourth and subsequent Ordinances were not adequately justified by the State of Bihar in spite of a specific challenge by the employees and therefore they were rightly stntck down by the High Court. (Dissenting view) (Per Madan B.Lokur, J.)"

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860- s.302 rlw s.34 - Murder -Appeal against the acquittal by trial court - Scope for interference - Appellants and victim-deceased were neighbours - There was enmity between them - Prosecution case that after a heated exchange, appellants chased down the deceased and assaulted him with weapons - When accused were chasing deceased, his wife (PW-13) and daughter (PW-2) had followed them and had witnessed the assault - PW-2 took deceased to the ho~pital where he succumbed to the injuries - Trial court acquitted all the accused - High Court, however, convicted the appellants and two others uls.302 r!w s.34 /PC - On appeal, held: Per Praful/a C. Pant, J.: Both PW-2 and PW-13 had described the blows inflicted in their presence, when they reached the spot and their conduct following the deceased was natural - Truthfulness of fact that deceased was laken to hospital by PW-2 is corroborated from the evidence on record of PW-3, au/orickl'haw driver who took deceased to !he hospilal mid same cannot be doubted only for reason that name mentioned in hospital records was of different person and no/ of PW-2 - Furlhe1; FIR was prompt - PW-2 and PW-13 stated that appellant had il?flicted blow in groin area but there was no injury on the said par/ of body, however, same not a reason to disbelieve the statements since a living human being is not expected to remain motionless while being inflicted with blow after blows - Furthe1; ocular evidence of the two witnesses corroborated from the same blood group found 011 stained clothes, earth sample and weapons recovered from appellants - Therefnot PW-2, who was not examined by the prosecution - PW-3 has been disbelieved both by the trial court and the High Court. but was a key witness on behalf of prosecution and his version destroys the version of two interested eye-wit11esses PW-2 and PW-13 inasmuch as he specifically states that neither witness was present at the Jpot when actual assault leading tu murder took place - High Court 8 wrongly states that mentioning of injury at the iliac region of deceased give strong credence to story of PW-2, here again. iliac region being region at the backside, there is, in fact, 110 injury near groin - Insofar as blood group is concerned, blood group of both the appellants and of deceased is of same group 'B ', .i\u00b7o it would not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the appellants were there, c given the fact that blood of deceased is also of group 'B ', in any case, this factor cannot alone outweigh other factors pointed out by trial court - Thus, for all these reasons the judgment of High Court reversed and both appellants-accused acquitted."

        ],
        "HeadNote": "Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or. VII, r.11 - Rejection of plaint - Held: The power u/Or. VII, r.11 can be exercised by the Court at any stage of the suit - The relevant facts which need to be looked into for deciding the application are the averments of the plaint only - If on an entire D and meaningful reading of the plaint, it is found that the suit is manifestly vexatious and merit/ess in the sense of not disclosing any right to sue, the court should exercise power u/Or. VII r.11 - The said power however have to be strictly adhered to -. The averments of the plaint have to be read as a whole to find out whether the averments disclose a cause of action or whether the suit is barred E by any law. Or. VII, r.11 -Averments in the written statement as well as the contentions of the defendant are wholly immaterial while considering the prayer of the defendant for rejection of the plaint - Even when, F the a/legations made in the plaint are taken to be correct as a whole on their face value, if they show that the suit is barred by any law, or do not disclose cause of action, the application for rejection of plaint can be entertained and the power u/Or. VII, r.11 can be exercised - If clever drafting of the plaint has created the illusion of a cause of action, the court will nip it in the bud at the earliest so G that bogus litigation end at the earlier stage. Or. VIL r.11 - Suit for cancellation of sale deed on the ground that the suit property was wakf property and that defendants having purchased through a private person, sale deed did not convey anyright, title or interest in favour of defendants - Application by A defendants including appellant u!Or. 7, r.11 for rejection of plaint - Wakf Tribunal allowed the application - High Court set aside the order of Wakf Board - On appeal, held: The Tribunal held that property in question was not notified in Official Gazette as a Wakf property, as alleged by the plaintiff - High Court though agreed B with the finding of fact arrived at by the Tribunal that the property was not notified as Wakf property in the Official Gazette, raised some doubt about the non-inclusion/inclusion of the property in the Survey Commissioners Report and proceeded to set aside the order of the Tribunal - Therefore, there were concurrent findings of fact that property in question was not notified in Official Gazette as a c Wakf property - Under s. 6, anyone aggrieved by such non-inclusion of the property in the list notified should raise the dispute within a period of one year from the date of publication of the Gazette notification - The plaintiff questioned the non-inclusion of the property in the list and the validity of the list notified in the official D gazette dated 28.06.1962 after the lapse of about 50 years by filing the instant suit - Moreover, as per s.27 of 1954 Act (s.40 of 1995 Act), the Board may itself collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be walif property and if any question arises whether a particular property is wakf property or not the Board after making such enquiry as it deems fit, decide the question E - The Board did not exercise jurisdiction u/s.27 of 1954 Act and s.40 of 1995 Act, though 50 years elapsed from the date of the gazette notification - The suit is manifestly meritless and vexatious - So also the suit is barred by law - Wakf Tribunal was right in allowing application u/Or.VII, r.11 - Wakf Act, 1954 - ss.6 and 27 F Wakf Act, 1995 - ss.6 and 40. Wakf - Similarity and difference between the 1954 Act and 1995 Act - Held: The provisions found in ss. 5 and 6 of Walif Act 1995 and Act of 1954 are almost akin to each other - Howeve1; the change brought in by the Parliament under 1995 Act is that, in the case of dispute regarding Wakfs, the aggrieved party needs to approach the Wakf Tribunal constituted uls.83 of the Walif Act 1995 and consequently the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is taken away - The overall view of the provisions contained in Wakf Act, 1954 and Wakf Act 1995 make it evident that even under 1954 Act, as in1995 Act, the Survey Commissioners were appointed for the purpose of making survey of wakfs in State - The Survey Commissioner is duty bound to conduct the survey of wakfs in the State and after making such enqui1y, submit his report in respect of Walifs exis_ting in the State to the State Government with necessary particulars - Copy of the said report would be forwarded by the State to the Wakf Board which in turn would examine the report by applying its mind and thereafter would publish the notification - Whereas under 1995 Act, the Wakf Board after examining the report forwards it back to Government within a period of 6 months for publication in the Official Gazette in the State - Pursuant thereto the State publish the Gazette notification."

G what this postulates is that no licence can be granted at all by the State Government within that distance - The state has a discretion on whether a licence should be granted under its enabling powers - No individual can assert a right to the grant of a licence - The directions issued by this Court did not breach any norm in the nature H of a prohibition nor did they operate to lift a prohibition imposed by law - The effect and purport of the direction is that in the interest.

        "HeadNote": "PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION ACT, 1988: Unique features, purpose of incorporation and its scope - Discussed. s.13(1)(e) - Criminal misconduct - Al to A4 entered into a conspiracy and in furtherance of the same, Al who was a public servant at the relevant time came into possession of assets disproportionate to the known sources of her income during the check period and got the same dispersed in the names of A2 to A4 and the firms and the companies involved to hold these on her behalf with a masked front - Conviction by trial court - Acquittal by High Court - On appeal, held: The reasoning given by the trial court in respect of criminal conspiracy and abetment is correct in the face of the evidence indicating the circumstances of active abetment and conspiracy by A2 to A4 in the commission of the above ojfences u/s.13(1)(e) of the 1988 Act - This is evident from the circumstances that Al had executed a General Power of Attorney in favour of A2 in respect of Jaya Publications - The circumstance of executing the power of attorney in favour of A2 indicated that with a view to keep herself secured from legal complications, Al executed the said power of attorney knowing fully well that under the said powers, A2 would be dealing with her fonds credited to her account in Jaya Publications - Constitution of various firms during the check period was another circumstance establishing the conspiracy between the parties - 10 firms were constituted on a single day - Jn addition, A2 and A3 started independent concerns and apart from buying properties, no other business activity was undertaken by them - The circumstances proved in evidence undoubtedly established that these firms were nothing but extentions of Namadhu MGR and Jaya Publications and they owed their existence to the benevolence of Al and A2 - These firms and companies were operatingji\u00b7om theresidence of Al and it cannot be accepted that she was unaware ol the same even though she feigned ignorance about the activities carried on by A2 to A4 - They were residing with Al without any blood relation between them - Although A2 to A4 claimed to have independent sources of income but the fact of constitution of.firms and acquisition of large tracts of land out of the .funds provided by B Al indicated that, all the accused congregated in the house ol Al neither for social living nor Al allowed them free accommodation out of humanitarian concern, rather the facts and circumstances proved in evidence undoubtedly pointed out that A2 to A4 were accommodated in the house of Al pursuant to the criminal c conspiracy hatched by them to hold the assets of Al - There was frequent and spontaneous if!flow of funds from the accounts of A-1 to those of the other co-accused and the .firms/companies involved which demonstrated the collective culpable involvement al respondents in the transactions - The judgment of trial court restored in toto against A2 to A4 - Since A-1 died during pendency ol D appeals, appeals related to her abated. E s. l 3(J)(e) - Interpretation of the expression \"satisfactorily account\" in the context of the offence of misconduct uls.5(J)(e) of Act of 1947 and s.13(J)(e) of Act 1988 - Word \"satisfactorily\" used by the legislature deliberately cast a burden on the accused not only to offer a plausible explanation as to how he came to acquire his large wealth but also to satisly the Court that his explanation was worthy of acceptance. s.l 3(J)(e) - Probative worth of Income Tax Proceedings qua lawfulness of the source of income :... IT returns and orders would F not ipso facto either conclusively prove or disprove the charge and can at best be pieces of evidence which have to be evaluated along with the other materials on record - Neither the income tax returns nor the orders passed in the proceedings relatable thereto, either definitively attest the lawfulness of the sources of income of the G accused 1\u2022ersons or are of any avail to them to satisfactorily account the di;proportionateness of their pecuniary resources and properties as mandated by s.13(J)(e) ol the PC Act. s. J 3(J)(e) - Gifts received by public servant - Receipt of huge amount of Rs.2 crores and foreign remittance as presents and H gi.fis as the Chief Minister of State - Gi.fis as claimed to have beenmade to Al were not only prohibited by law, having regard to her A office and the role attached thereto, but also constituted an offence thereunder - Disclosure of such gifts in the income tax returns of A 1 and the orders of the income tax authorities on the basis thereof, do not validate the said receipts to elevate the same to lawfit.l income to repel the charge uls. l 3(l)(e) thereof- Gifts to Al, a public servant B in the context of ss.161 to l 65A lPC now integrated into the Act are visibly illegal and forbidden by law - The endeavour to strike a distinction between \"legal\" and \"unlawful\" as sought to be made to portray gifts to constitute a lawfill source of income is thus wholly misconstrued - Penal Code, 1860 - ss.161 to l 65A. s. l 3(l)(e) - Disproportionate assets -According to respondent c No. 1, as against the jigure of Rs.24.29 crores being the value of new/additional construction of buildings during the check period, as computed by the prosecution, her assertion was of Rs.6.52 crores - Prima facie, the plea of the prosecution that in assessing the expenditure of new/additional buildings, the High Court had not D only taken a reduced constructed area of 1668.39 sq. Ji. instead of 2174.69\u00b7sqsft., thereby introducing a shortfall of506.3 sqs., it also applied the rate of Rs.28,0001- per sq. ft. based on the construction cost of a sentry shed, as the base value to work out the amount of investments made towards the new/additional buildings/constructions is borne out by the records - The approach of the High Court on E both counts in the face of the evidence on record is not acceptable - The adoption of Rs.28, 0001- per sq. ft. as the base value, which was the cost of construction of a sentry shed, per se was erroneous, having regard to the fact that a sentry shed and the new/additional constructions/buildings are not comparable. F s.l 3(1)(e) - Addition of Rs.4 crores by High Court towards income of Jaya Publications and Namadhu MGR to the .figure cited by the DVAC on account of Scheme deposit - Propriety of- Held: High Court was not justified in allowing an additional sum of Rs.4 crores as income of Jaya Publications merely on the basis of the G oral evidence of the 31 witnesses - Moreso, since the accused had failed to produce the primary documents in original before the auditors and the income tax authorities in support of scheme deposit - Trial court had duly considered these factors more particularly the inordinate delay in submission o,f income tax returnsmuch after the submission of the charge-sheet, along with the other attendant circumstances - Testimony of subscribers to the scheme was also rightly rejected by trial court as they were hardened party workers. s.13(l)(e) -Addition of Rs.1 crore by High Court towards income of Super Duper Pvt. Ltd. - This amount is claimed to be B legitimate income of A-3 from his business initially carried on as proprietor of Super Duper TV and later incorporated as Super Duper Pvt. Ltd. - Trial Court in contradistinction took pains to examine the trail of the income claimed by the company and the feasible investments thereof- It also took note of the huge it?flow and outflow c of cash to and from the accounts of the firms/companies of which the respondents were partners/directors during the check period so much so that the income claimed by A3 under t!ps head ceased to retain its independent identity so as to be accepted 'ds the discernible earnings of the company for transacting its business activities as a distinctly separate institution - The summary treatment of the D evidence on this issue by the High Court lacks the desired approach and, therefore, cannot be sustained - The addition awarded by it of income of Rs.1 crore to Super Duper T. V. \u00b7 Pvt. Ltd. thus cannot be upheld. E F s.13(1)(e)-Loan byA-1 toA-2-Addition of Rs.1.53 crores sought as loan from A-2 and her proprietary firms - Having regard to the persons and entities involved in the transactions, in the absence of other convincing evidence, the said receipts/deposits cannot be accepted to be lawful income as envisioned in s.13(l)(e) of the Act. s. l 3(1)(e) - Addition of Rs. 46. 71 lacs as agricultural income - High Court enhanced the agricultural income of A-1 to Rs.52.50 lacs - Held: In absence of any independent evidence in support of this claim, having regard to the state of law that income tax returns/orders are not automatically binding on the criminal G court, the effortless acceptance thereof by the High Court was in disregard to this settled proposition - High Court erred in accepting . income tax return and orders passed thereon and in adding Rs.46. 71 lakhs under the head of agricultural income. s.13(l)(e) -Addition of loan amount of Rs.18.17 crore byHigh Court - Held: The High Court wrongly totalled the amount to inflate figures to Rs.24.17 crores which in fact ought to have been Rs. l 0. 67 crore on correct calculations - Addition of Rs.18.17 crores as done by High Court was erroneous and not sustainable. s.J3(l)(e)-A-l s income from three companies - The deposits and withdrawals represented through the different entries in the bank accounts suggested multiplication of transactions stemming from the same corpus - The maze of financial exchanges in fragments involving different combinations hint at the attempt to inflate individual and collective income of the respondents - The banking transactions, though resorted to for proclaiming genuineness thereof. having regard to the overall factual conspectus did not appear to be real. s.J3(J)(e) - Expenditure incurred by A-1 in connection with marriage of A-3 - High Court reduced from Rs.6.45 crores and accepted the figure of Rs.28.68 lakhs towards expenditure towards marriage to be share of expense of A-1 - PW-181 Assistant Engineer PWD in his report mentioned inter alia, the areas of the various pandals together with the decorative attachments and after accounting for the cost thereof and the price of the furniture used and the amenities provided, estimated the expenditure to be Rs.5.91 crores towards the pandals and other arrangements to secure the intended facilities for the couple, guests and other participants - His findings in his report could be construed to be of an expert witness and further could be used as corroboration for the testimony of PW200 who indeed had supervised the same works himse(l and as claimed by the prosecution on the instructions/advise of A2 - PW200, Chief Engineer, P~D did assert on oath that he was instructed by A2 to complete the panda/ works as early as possible - He deposed as well that Al and A2 had inspected the work by visiting the site about a week prior to the marriage - In the face of the evidence in particular of the elaborate arrangements at the venues and the expenses incurred on other items associated with the event, the Trial Court did not err in not accepting the.figure of Rs.28.68 lacs as the expenditure incurred by Al on the basis of her reply to the queries made by the Income Tax Department. Corruption - It not only has a demoraliSing bearing on those who are ethical, honest, upright and enterprising, it is visibly 529 A B c D E F Gantithetical to the quintessential spirit of the jimdamental duty of every citizen to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity to raise the nation to higher levels of endeavour and achievement- Every citizen has to be a partner in this sacrosanct \u00b7 mission for a stable, just and ideal social order as envisioned by our forefathers and fondly cherished by the numerous se(f-effacing B crusaders 9J a free and independent Bharat, pledging their countless sacrifices and selfless commitments for such cause. (Per Amitava Roy, J.) PREVENTION OF CORRUPTION ACT, 1947: c D E F s.5(1)(e) - Interpretation of - Held: A bare perusal of clause (e) of s.5(1) of 1947 Act reveal that the criminal misconduct of the public servant, as envisaged therein, would ensue if he/she or any person on his/her behalf was in possession or had, at any point of time during the period of his/her office, been in possession of pecuniary resources or property, disproportionate to his/her known sources of income, which the public servant cannot sati!>factorily account - Significantly, for such misconduct, the possession of the disproportionate pecuniary resources or property, which the public servant is unable to satisfactorily account, can be held either by him/her or any person on his/her behalf is essential - This offence thus, enfolds in its sweep a definitive involvement and role of persons other than the public servant, either as a abetter or a co-conspirator in the actualisation of the crime - Consequently, thus such abettors or co-conspirators or partners in this item of offence, if proved, cannot escape the legal consequences for their participatory role. CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973: s.452 - Invocation of s.452 by special judge under PC Act to order confiscation/for.f'eiture of the properties otherwise attached under the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944 - Permissibility of - Held: Permissible - In terms of s.5(6), Special Judge is . G authorised to exercise all powers and/unctions exercisable by a District Judge under the Ordinance - Jn the instant case, the o.f)ences at the trial were u/ss.13(1)(e), 13(2) of the PC Act, ss.109 and 120B !PC encompassed within paragraphs 4A and 5 of the Schedule to the Ordinance - These offences were unimpeachably within the contours of the PC Act and triable by a special Judge thereunder -herefore, the order of confiscation/forfeiture of the properties standing in the name of six companies, as involved, made by the trial court is sustainable - Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944. A CRIMINAL LAW: Conspiracy - Proof of - Held: A conspiracy can be proved B by circumstantial evidence as having regard to the nature of the offending act, no direct evidence can be expected. CONSTITUTION OF INDIA: Art.136 - Scope of interference with an order of acquittal/ C conviction under Art.136 of the Constitution - Held: Once the Appellate Court comes to the conclusion that the view taken by the lower court was clearly unreasonable, then that by itself would be a compelling reason for interference - It is a courts duty to convict a guilty person when the guilt is established beyond reasonable doubt, no less than it is its duty to acquit the accused when such D guilt is not so established. EVIDENCE ACT, 1872: s.45 - Expert opinion/evidence - Probative. worth of - Held: An expert is one who has made a subject upon which he speaks or . E renders his opinion, a matter of particular study, practice or observation and has a special knowledge thereof- His knowledge must be within the recognized field of expertise and he essentially has to be qualified in that discipline of study - It has been propounded that an expert is not a witness of fact and its evidence is really of an advisory character and it is his duty to furnish to the F Judge/Court the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of the conclusions so as to enable the Judge/Court to .form his/its independent judgment by the application of such criteria to the facts proved by the evidence - By virtue of s.45 of the Evidence Act 1872, which makes the opinion of an expert admissible, not only an G expert must possess necessary special skill and experience in his discipline, his opinion must be backed by reason and has to be examined and cross-examined to ascertain the probative worth thereof - The evidentiary value of the opinion of an expert depends on the facts upon which it is based and also the validity of the process by which the conclusion has been reached - The Court isnot to subjugate its own judgment to that of the expert or delegate its authority to a third party but ought to assess the evidence of the expert like any other evidence. BENAMI TRANSACTIONS: B c Courts are usually guided by the following circumstances: The source from which the purchase money came; The nature of possession of the property, after the purchase; Notice, if any. for giving the transaction a benami colour; The position of the parties and the relationship, if any, between the claimant and the alleged benamdar; The custody of the title-deeds after the sale; and The conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the property ajter the sale. PENAL CODE, 1860: s.109 - Private individual can also be prosecuted/or offence uls.109. D INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES: Anti-corruption laws - Any interpretation of the provisions of anti-corruption laws has to be essentially positive, in .fi1rtherance of its mission and not in retrogression thereof (Per Amitava Roy, J.)"
