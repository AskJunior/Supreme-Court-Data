Nature of tax - Held: It is well settled that thenomenclature or form of a tax is not a decisive factor to find out thenature of the tax - It is the matter of legislative policy as to how thetax is to be collected.Tax/Taxation - Entry tax - The definition of taxation as givenin Art.266(28) that tax includes general or local tax does not in anymanner support the contention of the petitioner that tax under Entry52 is only a local tax which ought to be collected through localbodies - It is the matter of legislative policy that whether a tax iscollected as a general tax or a local tax - The nature of tax, measureof tax and machinery for tax collection are all different aspects - Itis well within the jurisdiction of the legislature to formulate its policyregarding levy qftax and its collection - No capital can be made onthe submission that since tax is not being collected by localauthorities it is beyond the power of the State under Entry 52 ListII.Interpretation of statutes - Taxation laws - While interpretinga taxing entry, no shackles can be put nor use of any expression inthe Constitution of India, referring to a tax can be tied up to anypre-constitutional tax or levy - Further, any pre-constitutional taxpractice cannot put any fetter on Constitution framers to defineany tax, to elaborate the concept of tax or to move away or forwardfrom any kind of earlier levy.Interpretation of statutes - It is well known rule of statutoryinterpretation that by process of interpretation. the provision cannotbe re-written nor any word can be introduced.Interpretation of Constitution - In deciding whether anyparticular enactment is within the purview of one Legislature or the other, it is pith and substance of the legislation that has to be lookedinto - Whenever a legislation is challenged as being under thecompetence of the State Legislature, the test, that one must find outby applying the rule of pith and substance that whether thelegislation falls with in any of the List JI, if it does, no further questionarises and attack on the ground of legislative competence must fail.Orissa Entry Tax Act, 1999 - ss.2(d), 3 - Whether Entry TaxLegislations contemplated levy of Entry Tax on imported goods -Held: Jn s.2(d), the word used is 'any place outside that local areaor outside the State' - The word 'any' is a word of very wide meaningand use of word 'any' excludes any limitation - All the threelegislations clearly did not exclude goods coming from outside theterritory of India and the definition of entry of goods read withcharging section clearly included all goods entering into a localarea - The expression \"any place\" before the words \"outside theState\" is also indicative of wide extent - The words 'any place'cannot be limited to a place within the territory of India when nosuch indication is discernible from the provisions of the Act - Thus,the submission that entry tax legislation did not include importedgoods cannot be accepted - Kera/a Tax Act, 1994 - Bihar Tax onEntry of Goods in Local Area for Consumption, Use or Sale, 1993.Orissa Entry Tax Act, 1999 - Schedule, Part JI Item 9 - Plantimported in knocked out condition - Whether covered by expression\" machinery and equipment\" as used in the schedule of Orissa Act,1999 \u00b7- Held: The Plant in a knocked out condition is nothing but acollection of machinery -

When the State on one hand. has. bylegislation laid down that abetting child marriage is a criminaloffence, it cannot, on the other hand defend this classification ofgirls below 18 years on the ground of sanctity of marriage becausesuch classification has no nexus with the object sought to beachieved - Further, the husband is not given the immunity in anyother penal provision except in Exception 2 to s.375 - It does not stand to reason that only for the offence of rape the husband should Abe granted such an immunity especially where the \"victim wife\" isaged below 18 years i.e. below the legal age of marriage and isalso not legally capable of giving consent to have sexual intercourse- Exception 2 to s.375 is. therefore, discriminatory and violative ofArt.14 of the Constitution.Constitutional validity ~flaw - Held (Per Deepak Gupta, J.):There are se!f imposed limitations laid down by the Court whiledeciding the issue whether a law is constitutional or not - If thelegislature enacts a law which is violative of the fundamental rightsof the citizens, is arbitrary and discriminatory, then the Court wouldbe failing in its duty if it does not either strike down the law or readdown the law in such a manner that it falls within the four cornersof the Constitution.Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA) - Scopeand amplitude of - Held (Per Deepak Gupta, J.): PCMA is a secularAct- It being a special Act dealing with children, the provision of Dthis Act will prevail over the provisions of both the Hindu MarriageAct, 1955, Muslim Marriages and Divorce Act, 1939 in so far aschildren are concerned.Interpreting the provisions, the Court"
