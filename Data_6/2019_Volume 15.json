Neogy\u2019case did not go into and decide the issue, whetherimmovable property would fall under the expression \u2018any property\u2019u/s. 102 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 102.Ratio decidendi \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: A decision is only anauthority for what it actually decides \u2013 The essence in a decision isits ratio \u2013 Not every observation found therein nor what logicallyflows from those observations is the ratio decidendi \u2013 Judgmenthas to be read as a whole and the observations have to be consideredin light of the instances which were before the court \u2013 This is theway to ascertain the true principles laid down by a decision \u2013 Ratiodecidendi cannot be decided by picking out words or sentences averse to the context under question from the judgment \u2013 Thus, it isclear that Tapas D. Neogy\u2019s case did not decide whether or not animmovable property will fall within the expression \u2018any property\u2019 insection 102 of the Code \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.102.Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944 : Promulgationof \u2013 Held: Was to prevent disposal or concealment of propertyprocured by means of offences specified in its Schedule, whichinclude offences punishable u/ss. 406, 408, 409, 411 and 414 IPCin respect of Government property, property of local authority or aCorporation established by or under a Central, Provincial or StateAct, etc., and an offence punishable under the Prevention ofCorruption Act, 1988 \u2013 This Ordinance is a permanent Ordinance\u2013 It was adopted by the Presidential Adaptation of Laws Order,1950 making it effective in the territory of India and, thus, continuesto remain in force."

proceedings is architecturaleducation \u2013 1972 Act however does not solely deal witharchitectural education \u2013 Further, the 1987 Act has certain featuresof a special law being devoted to setting up, supervision andmonitoring of institutions imparting technical education, but it doesnot cover technical education imparted by all types of institutions\u2013 Having regard to the scheme

1987.Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Principle of implied repeal \u2013Application of \u2013 Overlapping of powers between the Council ofArchitecture (CoA) constituted under the 1972 Act and the All IndiaCouncil for Technical Education (AICTE) constituted under the1987 Act, on the aspect of setting norms for architectural educationand monitoring the institutions engaged in imparting sucheducation \u2013 Dominant purpose of the two legislation \u2013 Held:Principle of implied repeal cannot apply so far as the provisionsrelating to architecture education is concerned, on the basis of the1987 Act having become operational \u2013 One of the dominantpurposes of the 1972 Act is recognition of qualifications onarchitecture \u2013 Registration of an architect is dependent uponacquisition of such recognised qualification \u2013 Said Act cannot beheld to have been repealed by implication for the sole reason ofinclusion of the word \u201carchitecture\u201d in the definition of technicaleducation\u2013 AICTE failed to discharge onus to establish that theprovisions of the 1972 Act was repealed by implication \u2013 ArchitectsAct, 1972 \u2013 All India Council of Technical

s.2(g)\u2013 Subject of conflict in the instant cases is architectural education as under the 1972 Act and the 1987 Act there are overlappingareas under which the respect ive Councils i.e. Council ofArchitecture (CoA) and the All India Council for TechnicalEducation (AICTE) could make Regulations \u2013 Plea that the contextof regulating architecture education requires exclusion of theexpression \u201carchitecture\u201d from the definition of technical education\u2013 Held: So far as these appeals are concerned, to altogetherexclude architecture from the purview of AICTE, that expression,i.e. architecture would have to be dropped from the definition oftechnical education \u2013 If the issue is examined in the externalcontext, which in this case would be the provisions of 1972 Act,such a course would be inevitable \u2013 A meaning different to whatis ascribed in the definition clause can be given to a word indifferent parts of a statute if the context so demands \u2013 Subject disputeinvolved in these appeals requires omission of the wordarchitecture from the definition of technical education \u2013 Suchcourse is also a permissible tool of construction to prevent absurdor unworkable results flowing from a statute \u2013 In respect of theprovisions of s.2 (g), the definition of \u201ctechnical education\u201d wouldhave to be given such a construction and the word \u201carchitecture\u201dshould be treated to have been inapplicable in cases where theAICTE imports its regulatory framework for institutions undertakingtechnical education \u2013 There would however be no substitutionbecause the context would not demand it \u2013 Architects Act, 1972 \u2013Interpretation of Statutes.t"

mandatory \u2013However, if the petitioning creditor fails to advertise the petitionwithin the prescribed time, r.101 accords discretion to the court tosubstitute such petitioning creditor with another creditor orcontributory, if latter is capable and desirous of prosecuting thewinding up petition \u2013 In the instant case, no such advertisementwas made \u2013 No other creditor or contributory expressed willingnessto prosecute the original winding up petition \u2013 At the same time, asnoted by the Division Bench of High Court, there were otherunsatisfied secured creditors of KOFL who were not given the optionto step into the shoes of the petitioning creditor in terms of r.101 \u2013Given the absence of a specific provision mandating that the petitiononly be advertised by petitioning creditor, the Company Court hasthe discretion to direct the publishing of an advertisement to securethe interest of other creditors \u2013 In such situations, the winding upproceedings cannot be dismissed, as it would frustrate the veryobjective of securing the interest of all creditors \u2013 Clearly, thesubmission for the Petitioner that the winding up petition deservesto be dismissed as all creditors of KOFL have been satisfied is beliedby the existence of the proceedings before the DRT \u2013 The recordsshowed that the settlement of dues was only with respect to theunsecured creditors of KOFL, which was carried out pursuant tothe orders issued by the Company Judge \u2013 Therefore, given that thesecured creditors of KOFL have still not been satisfied and arebound to be affected by any order dismissing the winding upproceeding, the Company Court is directed to issue appropriatedirections to the Official Liquidator for publishing the advertisementof the proceedings in accordance with law.Companies Act, 1956: ss.293, 531 \u2013 Whether the agreementto sell executed by KOFL in favour of petitioner amounted tofraudulent preference and consequently whether the petitioner hasa right to seek the execution of sale deed in its favour \u2013 Held: s.531is a provision that deals with the effect of winding up of a companyon its antecedent transactions \u2013 It provides that a transfer or anyother act done in relation to the property of a company within aperiod of six months before the commencement of its winding up(\u201ctwilight period\u201d) shall be deemed to be a fraudulent preferenceof its creditors and accordingly be invalid \u2013 In the instant case,s.531 should be read in conjunction with s.293, which stipulatesthat the sale of the whole, or substantially the whole of the propertyof a public company requires the consent of its general meeting \u2013s.531 provides that any act relating to the property of a companymay qualify as a fraudulent preference if two conditions are met \u2013First, the dominant motive in the mind of the company (as representedby its directors or general body of shareholders) should be to prefera particular creditor \u2013 Second, the said act must be undertakenduring the period of six months preceding the filing of the windingup petition of the company \u2013 While the first requirement ensuresthat the dominant intention to defraud creditors is detected, thesecond ensures that there is a level of commercial certainty andfinality of transactions for those interacting with the company \u2013s.293(1) requires the consent of the general meeting of a companyin case of a sale or disposition of the whole or substantial whole ofits property \u2013 s.293(1) is applicable to the instant case in view ofthe categorical finding by both the Courts below that the subjectproperty is the only immovable property of KOFL \u2013 Notably, noapproval from the general meeting of KOFL was obtained \u2013 Therewas only a Board resolution permitting Respondent No.1 to executeagreements of sale and other documents for the purpose of sellingthe subject property \u2013 In the absence of the requisite approval fromthe general meeting, the instant application for execution of a saledeed cannot be allowed as doing so would be allowing the Petitionerto sidestep the mandatory requirements of s.293(1) \u2013 A bare readingof s.531 shows that in addition to any transfer of property, it covers\u201cany other act relating to the property\u201d \u2013 These terms indicate thats.531 is comprehensive and includes indirect transactions within itsscope \u2013 The Petitioner is not precluded from benefiting from s.531on account of non-fulfilment of the six-month condition \u2013 Therefore the agreement to sell cannot be termed as a fraudulent preferenceunder s.531.Transfer of property: It is well-settled that the sale of animmovable property can only be effectuated through a sale deedand an agreement to sell does not transfer any right, title or interestin the immovable property."

Act of 2000 \u2013 In terms of the Notification,35 district level commit tees were consti tuted to verify castecertificates of candidates who wished to contest the elections tolocal authorities \u2013 High Court quashed the said Notification withdirection that for both, the matters of constitution of the Committeeand operation of the Vigilance Cell, the directions in KumariMadhuri Patil* case have to be given full effect to \u2013 The originalcertificates issued in pursuance of Government Resolution of30.07.2011 were directed to be recovered from the respectivepersons and destroyed forthwith \u2013 However, said judgment wasstayed and as a result these certificates, issued under the saidcircular, continued to hold the field and the process followed asper the Act of 2000, read with the Rules of 2003 \u2013 On 31.8.2012,Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, De-notifiedTribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward Classesand Special Backward Category (Regulation of

mandatory \u2013 The issuepertained to the interregnum period between Notification issuedon 30.07.2011 and Rules notified on 31.08.2012 \u2013 Challenge wasto the Caste Validity Certificates granted to the candidates on theground that the said certificates were obtained by fraud, with aprayer for direction to the Election Commission to reject the nomination papers of such candidates \u2013 Held: Requirement ofverification of certificates by the Vigilance Cell was provided tobe mandatory in terms of judgment in Kumari Madhuri Patil* \u2013However, as implemented for the interregnum period in question,the input from Vigilance Cell was obtained only selectively \u2013 Underthe Rules of 2012, the requirement was not made mandatory, butwhenever the Scrutiny Committee felt it could solicit a report ofvigilance inquiry and not in all cases \u2013 The exercise of issuanceof certificates cannot be a casual one \u2013 The Scrutiny Committeeconstituted to issue the validity certificates must thus at the slightestdoubt take the assistance of the Vigilance Cell to ensure that nonentitledpersons do not get benefit at the cost of entitled persons\u2013 The certificates in question were alleged to have been obtainedwithout vigilance reports and within a very short period of time \u2013The exercise carried out in the interregnum period between30.7.2011 and 31.8.2012 clearly showed that no proper exercisewas carried out or could have been carried out given the timeframe within which the caste certificates were issued \u2013 Thus, theexercise so undertaken cannot be upheld and has to be quashedwith the direction to carry out the said exercise afresh \u2013 It will befor the Caste Scrutiny Committee to carry out the aforesaid exercisewhile notifying the parties concerned through appropriate publicnotices \u2013 These directions were to ensure the objectives of the Actof 2000 i.e. issuance of certificates only to entitled persons,through a proper exercise, with proper assistance from the VigilanceCell \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 142 \u2013 Maharashtra ScheduledCastes, Scheduled Tribes, De-notified Tribes (Vimukta Jatis),Nomadic Tribes, Other Backward

the vaccum \u2013 In the absence of legislation\u2013 Held: The purpose of any judicial legislation is to fill a vacuum\u2013 It does not preclude legislators from enacting law \u2013 There is amplepower conferred by Art.32, read with Art.142 of the Constitutionto make orders which have the effect of law by virtue of Art.141of the Constitution, by issuing directions to fill the vacuum till suchtime as the legislature steps in to cover the gaps, or the executivedischarges its role \u2013 Judicial legislation.Administrative Law: Subordinate legislation/delegatedlegislation \u2013 Notification dated 30.7.2011 issued by the SocialJustice, Special Assistance Department of the State of Maharashtra,in exercise of powers under s.6(1) of Act of 2000 \u2013 Challengedon the ground that the Notification was not in conformity withdirections contained in Kumari Madhuri Patil* case \u2013 Held: Areading of Notification makes it clear that the Caste ScrutinyCommittees were constituted to facilitate verification of CasteCertificates of the candidates willing to contest for elective postin any local authority \u2013 The composition of the Committee wasmade in pursuance of the specific statutory power in terms of s.6(1)of the Act of 2000 \u2013 As far as a delegated legislation or anotification issued under statutory powers is concerned, thechallenge can be laid only in terms of well settled principles i.e.either the rule or notification is contrary to the provisions of theAct, or contrary to any provision of the Constitution, or bringsabout a conflict which is required to be resolved by the Court \u2013The challenge in this case is not based on any of these parameters,but is simply on the ground that the notification is not in exactconformity with the directions issued by this Court in KumariMadhuri Patil case \u2013 Such a challenge would not be sustainablein view of the settled principles of examining such subordinatelegislation/statutory notifications \u2013 Thus, once the legislature laysdown a legislative policy, and confers discretion upon theadministrative agency for the execution of such policy, it is up tothe agency to work out the details within the framework of thepolicy \u2013 Maharashtra Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, DenotifiedTribes (Vimukta Jatis), Nomadic Tribes, Other BackwardClasses and Special Backward

victim child wentmissing around 4.00 p.m. \u2013 During the search operations by policeand family members of the missing child, it surfaced that theappellant was seen distributing chocolates to children around thetime the child went missing \u2013 Police reached the house of appellantand nabbed the appellant red handed under the bed with the victimchild in naked condition \u2013 Trial court and High Court concurrentlyheld him guilty and awarded death sentence \u2013 Appeal againstconviction and sentence \u2013 Held: It stood conclusively establishedthat the victim child was brutally assaulted and subjected to vaginaland unnatural intercourse \u2013 She was inflicted multiple injuries onface, head, neck, external genitalia as well as inside the uterusand urethra \u2013 Medical opinion was that death was due to throttling\u2013 There was overwhelming eye-witness account, circumstantialevidence, medical evidence and DNA analysis on record whichconclusively proved that it was appellant and he alone, whocommitted the horrendous crime \u2013 Appellant had the specialknowledge as to in what circumstances the victim child sufferedmultiple injuries \u2013 Burden to prove that those injuries were notcaused by him was on the appellant alone in view of s.106 of theEvidence Act, which he miserably failed to discharge though theevidence on record proved beyond doubt that the victim child wasin unlawful custody of the appellant from about 4.00 p.m. till shebreathed her last breath due to the beastly attack on her \u2013Conviction of appellant is upheld \u2013 Protection of Children fromSexual Offences Act, 2012 \u2013 Protection of Children from SexualOffences Amendment Act, 2019.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Rape and murder oftwo year old girl \u2013 Prayer for commutation of death sentence \u2013Held: The victim in this case was barely a two-year old baby girlwhom the appellant kidnapped and apparently kept on assaultingover 4-5 hours till she breathed her last \u2013 Appellant who had nocontrol over his carnal desires surpassed all natural, social andlegal limits just to satiate his sexual hunger \u2013 He ruthlessly finisheda life which was yet to bloom \u2013 He, instead of showing fatherlylove, affection and protection to the child against the evils of thesociety, rather made her the victim of lust \u2013 It\u2019s a case where trustwas betrayed and social values were impaired \u2013 The unnatural sexwith a two-year old toddler exhibits a dirty and perverted mind,showcasing a horrifying tale of brutality \u2013 The appel lantmeticulously executed his nefarious design by locking one doorof his house from the outside and bolting the other one from theinside so as to deceive people into believing that nobody was inside\u2013 He was thus in his full senses while he indulged in this senselessact \u2013 He showed no remorse or repentance for the gory crime,rather he opted to remain silent in his 313 Cr.P.C. statement \u2013 Hisdeliberate, well-designed silence with a standard defence of \u2018false\u2019accusation revealed his lack of kindness or compassion and wouldlead to believe that he can never be reformed \u2013 That being so, casefor interference with the death sentence is not made out \u2013 Protectionof Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 \u2013 Penal Code, 1860\u2013 ss.302, 363, 376 and 377.Criminal Law: Evidence \u2013 Motive \u2013 Though the High Courtobserved that \u2018satisfaction of lust\u2019 and \u2018removal of trace\u2019 was theappellant\u2019s motive but motive is not an explicit requirement underthe Indian Penal Code, though \u2018motive\u2019 may be helpful in provingthe case of the prosecution in a case of circumstantial evidence \u2013The case in hand was not entirely based on circumstantial evidenceas there were reliable eye-witness depositions who had seen theappellant committing the crime, may be in part \u2013 Such anunshakable evidence with dense support of DNA test did not requirethe definite determination of the motive of the appellant behind thegruesome crime.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Doctrine ofproportionality \u2013 The object and purpose of determining quantumof sentence has to be \u2018society centric\u2019 without being influenced by a \u2018judge\u2019s\u2019 own views, for society is the biggest stake holder inthe administration of criminal justice system \u2013 A civic society hasa \u2018fundamental\u2019 and \u2018human\u2019 right to live free from any kind ofpsycho fear, threat, danger or insecurity at the hands of anti-socialelements \u2013 The society legitimately expects the Courts to applydoctrine of proportionality and impose suitable and deterrentpunishment that commensurates with the gravity of offence.Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012: s.5\u2013 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Amendment Act,2019 \u2013 Aggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault \u2013 Punishment \u2013 Theunamended Act defines \u201cAggravated Penetrative Sexual Assault\u201din s.5, which included, \u201cwhoever commits aggravated penetrativesexual assault on a child below the age of 12 years\u201d \u2013 Originally,the punishment for an aggravated sexual assault was rigorousimprisonment for a term not less than 10-years but which mayextend for imprisonment for life with fine \u2013 The minimum sentencefor an aggravated penetrative sexual assault has been increasedfrom 10 years to 20 years and imprisonment for life has now beenexpressly stated to be imprisonment for natural life of the person\u2013 Significantly, \u2018death sentence\u2019 has also been introduced as apenalty for the offence of aggravated penetrative sexual assaulton a child below 12 years \u2013 The Legislature impliedly distanceditself from the propounders of \u201cNo-Death Sentence\u201d in \u201cNoCircumstances\u201d theory and re-stated the will of the people that inthe cases of brutal rape of minor children below the age of 12years without murder of the victim, \u2018death penalty\u2019 can also beimposed \u2013 In the Statement of Objects and Reasons of amendment,Parliament has shown its concern of the fact that \u201cin recent pastincidents of child sexual abuse cases administering the inhumanmindset of the accused, who have been barbaric in their approachto young victim, is rising in the country\u201d \u2013 If the Parliament, armedwith adequate facts and figures, has decided to introduce capitalpunishment for the offence of sexual abuse of a child, the Courthitherto will bear in mind the latest Legislative Policy even thoughit has no applicability in a case where the offence was committedprior thereto \u2013 The judicial precedents rendered before the recentamendment came into force, therefore, ought to be viewed with apurposive approach so that the legislative and judicial approachesare well harmonised \u2013 Crime against children \u2013 Sentence/Sentencing.Administration of Criminal Justice: Punishment to the rapeaccused \u2013 Sentencing Policy needs to strike a balance betweenthe two sides and count upon the twin test of (i) deterrent effect,or (ii) complete reformation for integration of the offender in civilsociety \u2013 Where the Court is satisfied that there is no possibility ofreforming the offender, the punishments before all things, must bebefitting the nature of crime and deterrent with an explicit aim tomake an example out of the evil-doer and a warning to those whoare still innocent \u2013 Sentence/Sentencing.Evidence: Medical evidence \u2013 DNA \u2013 Plea of appellantaccusedthat the prosecution relied on the DNA evidence despitethe fact that the method of analysis used i.e. Y-Chromosome ShortTandem Repeat Polymorphism (Y-STR) has certain inherentlimitations due to which accurate identification of accused cannotbe established beyond reasonable doubt and that the said methoddid not accurately identify the accused as the perpetrator; andunlike other methods say autosomal-STR analysis, it cannotdistinguish between male members in the same lineage \u2013 Held: Pleais rejected \u2013 The globally acknowledged medical literature coupledwith the statement of the Assistant Director, Forensic ScienceLaboratory leaves no doubt that in cases of sexual assualt, DNAof the victim and the perpetrator are often mixed \u2013 Traditional DNAanalysis techniques like \u201cautosomal-STR\u201d are not possible in suchcases \u2013 Y-STR method provides a unique way of isolating only themale DNA by comparing the Y-Chromosome which is found onlyin males \u2013 It is no longer a matter of scientific debate that Y-STRscreening is manifestly useful for corroboration in sexual assaultcases and it can be well used as exculpatory evidence and isextensively relied upon in various jurisdictions throughout the world\u2013 Science and Researches have emphatically established thatchances of degradation of the \u2018Loci\u2019 in samples are lesser by thismethod and it can be more effective than other traditional methodsof DNA analysis \u2013 Although Y-STR does not distinguish betweenthe males of same lineage, it can, nevertheless, may be used as astrong circumstantial evidence to support the prosecution case \u2013Y-STR techniques of DNA analysis are both regularly used invarious jurisdictions for identification of offender in cases ofsexual assault and also as a method to identify suspects in unsolvedcases \u2013 Medical jurisprudence.Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Commutation of \u2013Aggravating and mitigating circumstances \u2013 Rape and murder oftwo year old girl child \u2013 Held: (Per R. Subhash Reddy, J. -dissenting on sentencing part) \u2013 In a case of conviction based oncircumstantial evidence, ordinarily the extreme punishment of deathpenalty should not be imposed \u2013 If in a given case, guilt of theaccused is proved beyond reasonable doubt, by establishing chainof circumstances, resulting in conviction, in appropriate casesdeath penalty can be imposed only after considering balancingaspects of aggravating and mitigating circumstances \u2013 But, at thesame time ordinarily, if no special reasons exist, in a case ofconviction based on circumstantial evidence, death penalty shouldnot be imposed \u2013 In the instant case, conviction of the appellantwas mainly based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 The evidence onrecordshowed that on the day of occurrence, the appellant wasunder influence of liquor and committed the offence and,therefore, it cannot be termed as a pre-planned one, to count thesame as an aggravating circumstance, for balancing aggravatingand mitigating circumstances \u2013 The socio-economic condition ofthe appellant, as a person below poverty line, can also beconsidered as one of the mitigating factors, while balancing theaggravating and mitigating factors \u2013 There was no evidence fromthe side of prosecution, to show that there was no possibility ofreformation and rehabilitation of the appellant \u2013 Age of theappellant was 25 years at the relevant time \u2013 He also had no crimerecord \u2013 Thus, the mitigating circumstances of the appellant,dominated over the aggravating circumstances, to modify the deathsentence to that of life imprisonment \u2013 In view of all these aspects,death penalty imposed on the appellant is modified to that of lifeimprisonment, for the offence under s.302 IPC \u2013 Penal Code, 1860\u2013 s.302."

No.4184 of2009, the assessee-respondent Club, registered u/s.25, 1956 Actwas issued notice informing that it had failed to make payment ofsales tax on sale of food and drinks to the permanent members \u2013Respondent contended that there could be no sale by it to its ownpermanent members, for doctrine of mutuality would come into play\u2013 West Bengal Taxation Tribunal held that the respondent is noteligible to tax under the 1994 Act \u2013 Affirmed by the High Court \u2013Division Bench of the Supreme Court set out inter alia 3 questions tobe answered by larger Bench, viz.(i) Whether the doctrine ofmutuality is still applicable to incorporated clubs or any club afterthe 46th Amendment to Art.366(29-A) of the Constitution of India?;(ii) Whether the judgment of Supreme Court in Young Men\u2019s IndianAssociation case still holds the field even after the 46th Amendment?and (iii) Whether the 46th Amendment, by deeming fiction providesthat provision of food and beverages by the incorporated clubs toits permanent members constitute sale, thus liable to sales tax? \u2013 InC.A. No.7497 of 2012 and connected matters, issue involves levyingof service tax by Finance Act, 1994 upon members\u2019 clubs, majorityof them being registered as Companies u/s.25 of the 1956 Act, or asco-operative societies under various State Acts \u2013 Held: Young Men\u2019sIndian Assn. made no distinction between a club in the corporateform and a club by way of a registered society or incorporated by adeed of trust \u2013 What is the essence of the judgment is that the holdingof property must be a holding for and on behalf of the members ofthe club, there being no transfer of property from one person toanother \u2013 In members\u2019 clubs there is a complete identity betweencontributors and participators \u2013 Thus, in members\u2019 clubs there is no sale by one person to another for consideration, as one cannotsell something to oneself \u2013 What is of essence in applying thedoctrine of mutuality is that there is no sale transaction betweentwo persons, as one person cannot sell goods to itself \u2013 Ratio ofYoung Men\u2019s Indian Assn. has not been done away with by the limitedfiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) \u2013 Questions answered (i)Doctrine of mutuality continues to be applicable to incorporatedand unincorporated members\u2019 clubs after the 46th Amendment addingArt.366(29-A); (ii) Young Men\u2019s Indian Assn. and other judgmentswhich applied this doctrine continue to hold the field even after the46th Amendment; and (iii) Sub-clause (f) of Art.366(29-A) has noapplication to members\u2019 clubs \u2013 No interference called for in thefindings of fact or declaration of law in this case \u2013 Further, in C.A.No.7497/12 and connected matters- Argument on behalf of therespondents that incorporated clubs or associations prior to 1st July,2012 were not included in the service tax net is accepted \u2013 Whathas been stated in the present judgment so far as sales tax isconcerned applies on all fours to service tax\u2013 Explanation 3(a) tos.65B(44) of the Finance Act, 1994 does not apply to members\u2019clubs which are incorporated \u2013 From 2005 onwards, the FinanceAct, 1994 does not purport to levy service tax on members\u2019 clubs inthe incorporated form \u2013 Jharkhand High Court and the GujaratHigh Court correct in their view of the law in following Young Men\u2019sIndian Assn. Case \u2013 Thus, show-cause notices, demand notices andother action taken to levy and collect service tax from incorporatedmembers\u2019 clubs are void and of no effect in law \u2013 West Bengal

Art.366(29-A) \u201361st Law Commission Report \u2013 Plea on behalf of the appellants,referring to the said Report, which preceded the enactment ofArt.366(29-A); the \u2018Statement of Objects and Reasons\u2019 appendedto the 1981 Bill, which led to the insertion of Art.366(29-A); and in particular to Art.366(29-A)(e), (f) to contend that Art.366(29-A)(e)was inserted in order to do away with the doctrine of mutuality,insofar as it applied to members\u2019 clubs and, therefore, sought to doaway with the basis of the judgment in Young Men\u2019s Indian Assn.case \u2013 Held: Statement of Objects and Reasons has not read thecase of Young Men\u2019s Indian Assn. in its correct perspective \u2013 YoungMen\u2019s Indian Assn. had three separate appeals before it, in one ofwhich a company was involved \u2013 To state, therefore, that under thelaw as it stood on the date of the 46th Amendment, a sale of goodsby a club having a corporate status to members is taxable, is whollyincorrect \u2013 Proceeding on this incorrect basis, the 46th Amendmentthen sought to bring to tax sales by clubs which have no separateexistence from that of their members \u2013 In so doing, the 46thAmendment used the expression \u201cany unincorporated associationor body of persons\u201d \u2013 This expression, when read with the Statementof Objects and Reasons, makes it clear that it was only clubs whichare not in corporate form that were sought to be brought within thetax net, as it was wrongly assumed that sale of goods by members\u2019clubs in the corporate form were taxable \u2013\u201dAny\u201d is the equivalentof \u201call\u201d\u2013 This word, therefore, also lends itself to the aforesaidinterpretation, as the emphasis of the legislature is on allunincorporated associations or bodies being brought within subclause(e) \u2013 Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Bill, 1981 \u2013Constitution (Forty-sixth Amendment) Act, 1982 \u2013 Interpretation ofStatutes \u2013 Doctrine of Mutuality.Words & Expressions \u2013 \u201cunincorporated association or bodyof persons\u201d in sub-clause (e) to Art.366(29-A) \u2013 Plea on behalf ofthe appellants that the said expression must be read disjunctivelyand thus, would include incorporated persons such as companies,cooperative societies etc. \u2013 Held: On the assumption that\u201cunincorporated association or body of persons\u201d must be readdisjunctively, \u201ca body of persons\u201d cannot be equated with \u201cperson\u201d\u2013 \u201cPerson\u201d as defined by the General Clauses Act (which appliesto the interpretation of the Constitution vide Art.367) states that\u201cperson\u201d shall include any company or association or body ofindividuals, whether incorporated or not \u2013 Art.366(29-A) does notuse this expression, as \u201cperson\u201d would then include corporatepersons as well \u2013 \u201cbody of persons\u201d is used to make it clear beyond doubt that corporate persons are not referred to \u2013 Further, contrastin the language of the 1961 Act and Art.366(29-A)(e) again leadsto the conclusion that \u201cbody of persons\u201d would not refer to thecorporate form unless \u201cperson\u201d by itself is accompanied by theexpression \u201cwhether incorporated or not\u201d \u2013 Constitution of India\u2013 Art.366(29-A)(e), 367 \u2013 General Clauses Act \u2013 Income TaxAct, 1961 \u2013 s.2(31) \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes.Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s.2(d) \u2013 Plea on behalf of the respondentthat s.2(d) makes it clear that consideration must flow from oneperson to another and in the absence of two players, as in the caseof Young Men\u2019s Indian Assn., Art.366(29-A) would have no application\u2013 Held: \u201csupply\u201d of goods by an unincorporated association orbody of persons has to be to a member for cash, deferred paymentor other valuable consideration \u2013 Correctly argued by therespondents, the definition of \u201cconsideration\u201d in s.2(d) of the 1872Act necessarily posits consideration passing from one person toanother \u2013 This is further reinforced by the last part of Art.366(29-A), as under this part, the supply of such goods shall be deemed tobe sale of those goods by the person making the supply, and thepurchase of those goods by the person to whom such supply is made\u2013 As the Young Men\u2019s Indian Assn. case and the doctrine of mutualitystate, there is no sale transaction between a club and its members \u2013Ratio of Young Men\u2019s Indian Assn. has not been done away with bythe limited fiction introduced by Art.366(29-A)(e) \u2013 Constitution ofIndia \u2013 Art.366(29-A) \u2013 West Bengal Sales Tax Act, 1994 \u2013 ss.2(5),(30) \u2013 Doctrine of Mutuality.Constitution of India\u2013 Art.366(29-A)(e), (f)\u2013 Applicability ofsub-clause (f) to members\u2019 club \u2013 Held: Reason for sub-clause (f),as stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons, is the doingaway with of two judgments of Supreme Court, viz., Associated Hotelsof India Ltd. and Northern India Caterers \u2013 This is also clear from thesubject matter of sub-clause (f) (which does not include \u201cgoods\u201d intheir entirety, but only food or any other article for humanconsumption, or any drink), which is the serving of such food ordrink in hotels or restaurants \u2013 This is further made clear by s.6 ofthe 46th Amendment Act, which is a validation and exemptionprovision \u2013 s.6(1)(a) specifically refers to transactions referable tothe aforesaid two Supreme Court judgments \u2013 Sub-clause (a) of s.6(2) refers to 07.09.1978, which is the date on which NorthernIndia Caterers was pronounced and sub-clause (b) refers to04.01.1972, when Associated Hotels of India Ltd. was pronounced \u201346th Amendment Act, therefore, when read as a whole, would makeit clear that Art.366(29-A)(f) refers only to an undoing of theaforesaid two judgments, the subject matter being the taxability offood or drink served in hotels and restaurants \u2013 Thus, the taxabilityof food or drink served in members\u2019 clubs is not the subject matterof sub-clause (f) \u2013 Subject matter of sub-clause (f) is entirelydifferent and distinct from that of sub-clause (e), and cannot possiblyapply to members\u2019 clubs \u2013 Thus, expression \u201cin any mannerwhatsoever\u201d, being part and parcel of sub-clause (f) cannot beheld to extend to a supply of all goods so as to bring such goods totax when applied to members\u2019 clubs \u2013 Constitution

clear when sub-clause (e) is contrastedwith s.2(24)(vii) of the 1961 Act r/w s.44 \u2013 A reading of the saidprovisions make it clear that when profits and gains of a mutualinsurance company are sought to be brought to tax, they are sodone by express reference to the fact that the business of insuranceis carried on by a mutual insurance company \u2013 Absence of anysuch language in sub-clause
