        "HeadNote": "SALES TAX NEW INCENTIVE SCHEME FOR INDUSTRIES, 1989:Item 1 E (Annexure C) - New cement industry - Entitlement to exemption under the Scheme - Held: Item 1 E classified the cement units for eligibility of tax exemption into three categories; small, medium and large - The said categories are comprehensive whereby small and medium 0 cement unit~ have been prescribed to have maximum Fixed Capital Investment (FCI) of Rs.601- lakhs and Rs.51- crores, respectively and FCl of large to be over Rs. 51- crores - As against items 1, , 4, 6 and 7, which deal with units of all industries and not ' only cement, item 1 E restricted to only E cement units and therefore being a special entry override the general provision - In the instant case, the respondent- Company would only be eligible for grant of exemption under Item 1  as a large new cement unit in accordance with its FCI being above Rs. 51- crores.INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES:General entry over specific - Held: Where a Statute contains both a general provision as well as specific provision, the latter must prevail - In other words, where a general statute and a specific statute relating to the same subject matter cannot be reconciled, the special or specific statute ordinarily will control - The principle finds its origins in the latin maxim of generalia specialibus non derogant, i.e., general law yields to special law should they operate in the same field on same subject.Rule of Harmonious Construction - Conflict between independent provisions of law - Held: When there is an apparent conflict between two independent provisions of law, the special provision must prevail - This rule has application in construction of taxing statutes along with the proposition that the provisions must be given the most beneficial interpretation - While determining the question whether a statute is a general or a special one, focus must be on the principal  subject-matter coupled with a particular perspective with reference to the intendment of the Act - With this basic principle in mind, the provisions must be examined to find out whether it is possible to construe harmoniously the two provisions - Once it is held that intention of the legislation is  to exclude the general provision then the rule \"general provision should yield to special provision\" is squarely attracted - The rule of statutory construction that the specific governs the general is not an absolute rule but is merely a strong indication of statutory meaning that can be overcome by textual indications that point in the other direction."

The murder was committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical and dastardly manner and the accused was in a dominating position and the victim was an innocent boy - Life of a boy,the only son of his mother, was taken away which pricks not only the judicial conscience but also the conscience of the society - Incarceration of a further period of thirty years, without remission, in addition to the sentence already undergone, will be\u00b7 an adequate punishment in the facts and circumstances of the case, rather than death sentence - Sentence!

SENTENCE/SENTENCING: Rarest of rare case - Held: R-R Test depends upon the E perception of the society that is \"society-centric\" and not \"Judge-centric': that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certain types of crimes or not - While applying that test, the court has to look into variety of factors like society's abhorrence, extreme indignation and F antipathy of certain types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of minor girls, intellectually challenged minor girls, minors suffering from physical disability, old and infirm women, etc. - In the instant case, offence u/s. 377 was fully proved so also the offence u/s.302 - Indian society and also G the International society abhor pederasty, an unnatural sex, i.e. carnal intercourse between a man and a minor boy or a girl - When the victim is a minor, consent is not a defence, irrespective of the views expressed at certain quarters on \u00b7 \u00b7 H consensual sex between adults.Reformation and rehabilitation - Determination of sentence - Duty of courts - Held: It is the duty of the Court to ascertain whether the accused would be a menace to the society and there would be no possibility of reformation and rehabilitation and the 'state is obliged to furnish materials for B and against the possibility of reformation and rehabilitation of the accused.

A Pleadings: Held: A party has to plead the case and produce/adduce sufficient evidence to substantiate his submissions made in the plaint and in case the pleadings are not complete, the Court is under no obligation to entertain the pleas.  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s. 100 - Held: There is no prohibition for the High Court to entertain the Second Appeal even on question of fact where factual findings are found to be perverse."

        ],
        "HeadNote": " Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.173(8) - Dowry case filed by petitioner-wife against husband and in-laws - Charge-sheet - At the time of framing of charges, petitioner filed application seeking further investigation of the case with respect to her 'stridhan' properties and the palmtop communicator, stating that though in the complaint there was a specific case that 'stridhan' was with husband and his family members, no efforts were made by Investigating Officer to recover it - Further investigation ordered - Ornaments produced by husband but refusal by petitioner to take them on the ground that they were not the complete ornaments - Investigating Officer finally gave report that nothing was required to be done with respect to the Palmtop - Thereafter, petitioner submitted another application before Magistrate for further investigation u/s. 173(8) with a special direction that the same be conducted under the direct supervision of an officer not below the rank of Asstt. Commissioner of Police of zone, within whose jurisdiction the Police Station falls, reiterating the same grievance which was made earlier - Magistrate allowed the said application - Revision application by respondents partly allowed observing that Magistrate was not justified in directing further investigation on a particular aspect (Stridhan and Palmtop) and that too by a particular officer - High Court upheld the order- SLP - Held: High Court was right in holding that all steps pertaining to investigation of stridhan property had been allowed in favour of the petitioner and even suo moto investigation was conducted by the police which subsequently was confirmed by the order of the Magistrate - Thus, whatever was legally possible was already allowed in favour of petitioner - The attending circumstances showed that she had not moved the Court bonafide but perhaps to teach a lesson to the respondent-husband rather than recovery of her stridhan property - In any view, if the investigation conducted by the authorities did not suffer from the lacunae or serious infirmity, there is no reason to issue any further direction to the court below to take steps in the matter - However, all remedies in accordance with law for recovery of 'stridhan property', would c be available to the petitioner.

ADMINISTRATION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE: Held: Essence of criminal justice system is to reach the truth - The C underlying principle is that whilst the guilty must not escape punishment; no innocent person shall be punished unless the guilt of the suspect/accused is established in accordance with law - All suspects/accused are presumed to be innocent till their guilt is proved beyond reasonable doubt in a trial conducted according to the procedure prescribed under law. D E F G H BAIL: Entitlement for - In the instant case, appellant was a\"ested when he appeared before the CBI in response to the summons - Since then he was in custody - Supplementary charge-sheet filed by the CBI - After the charge-sheet, the appellant was no longer required for further investigation - There was no likelihood of the appellant tampering with the evidence as the copies of all the sensitive statements were not supplied to the appellant - Keeping in view the fact that the CBI has submitted the supplementary charge-sheet and that the trial is likely to take a long time, it is deemed appropriate to enlarge the appellant on bail, subject to conditions of furnishing personal security."

CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, 1950 - Article 47 - Liquor - Right to trade - Held: There is no fundamental right to trade . in liquor - At the same time where such a trade is permitted, there cannot be any room for discrimination.KERALA ABKARI ACT: r.13 - Kerala Abkari Policy 2011-12 -Amendment to s.13 F omitting words 'three star' from r. 13(3) - Constitutionality of - Held: In the case of . Six Holiday Resorts, the deletion of two star hotels from the eligibility of FL-3 licences was upheld by Supreme Court - It was held therein that promotion of tourism should be balanced with general public interest and G that if policy is not open to challenge the amendment of the rules to effect the policy can also not be challenged - Deletion of three star hotels falls in the same genre as the deletion of two star hotels, which was done earlier - This being the position, the State cannot be faulted for deletion of three star hotels after a periodical revision of the policy.r.13 - Kerala Abkari Policy 20'11-12 -Amendment to r.13 introducing distance rule - Constitutionality of - Held: The consequences of the amendment would be that four star and five star hotels would not be permitted to have FL-3 licences only on the ground that they are within the prohibited distance from such hotels which have poor hygiene standards, and which are not following norms laid down by the State Government - As per the report of the GAG, there was violation of licence conditions by the Bar Hotels - The Excise Commissioner also sent a letter to the Government \u00b7 highlighting poor standards maintained by the 418 unclassified bars and requesting not to grant fresh FL3 licenses as during the last one year several people had died due to excessive drinking in the unclassified hotels - Even then seven more FL3 licenses were issued - Moreover in the Abkari Policy for 2010-11, the Government declared that the FL3 licensees not having the requisite star qualification and ,,-.;ho were functional during 2009-10 should be regularized - Government having not taken a firm stand to ensure that only hotels of a minimum standard are issued FL3 licenses has seriously compromised public safety - This is counter- productive to the objective of r. 13(3), which is to promote tourism, as well as to the State's avowed policy of improving the health and nutrition standards of its citizens - In the circumstances, although there is no dispute regarding the power of the State Government to bring about the necessary reform, by modifying the rules, it has got to be justified on the touchstone of the correlation between the provision and the objective to be achieved - If that correlation is not established, surely the rule will suffer from the vice of arbitrariness, and therefore will be hit by Article 14 - The State Government has appointed a one-man commission for reviewing the Abkari Policy, by issuing a necessary notification - The commission would take into consideration the hard realities which are reflected in the report of the CAG and make necessary recommendations - In these circumstances, distance rule by way of addition of Rule (3E) in Rule 13(3) is held to be bad in law - The state government will not proceed to deny FL3 licenses to hotels with a classification of four star and above by resorting to their deletion under r. 13(3) until the report of B the one-man commission is received, and until it takes action against the non-standard restaurants which have been permitted under the sixth and seventh proviso of r. 13(3). Classification and reclassification of hotels - Bar licence - Held: The two star and three star hotels stand on a different C footing as against the hotels with four star and higher classification under the tourism policy of the Government of India - The Ministry of Tourism of the Government of India has issued the amended guidelines for classification/re- classification of hotels on 28. 6. 2012 - The classification of the D hotels into star categories and heritage categories is done thereunder, and it is a voluntary scheme - If a local law prohibits the issuance of a bar licence to four star, five star, five star deluxe, heritage classic and heritage grand categories, which is otherwise necessary, such local law will E prevail - In any case three star hotels will have to be placed in a different category as against the hotels with four star and higher classification, since it is not necessary for three star hotels to have an FL3 licence."
