Companies Act, 1956: s.396 \u2013 Derivative immunity of the Central Government order \u2013 Whether the Central Government\u2019s order made under s.396 would also receive the protective umbrella of Art.31A, given the fact that s.396 is undoubtedly protected by Art.31A \u2013 Whether order of Central Government passed under s.396 is administrative in nature \u2013 Held: The expression \u201claw\u201d, as defined in Art.13(3)(a), includes an Ordinance, rule, regulation, notification, and custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law \u2013 Obviously, therefore, when the expression \u201corder\u201d is used, it would take colour from Ordinance, rule, regulation, notification, which are all legislative in nature, and not administrative \u2013 Even custom or usage having the force of law refers to general rules of conduct, as opposed to administrative orders passed on the facts of a case \u2013 However, the Central Government\u2019s order in question directly impacts the rights and liabilities of the companies, their shareholders and creditors, sought to be amalgamated under the order \u2013 Such order is not an order in general which applies to all such companies, but only to the particular companies sought to be amalgamated and does not lay down any general rule of conduct by itself, but in fact, follows the general rule of conduct laid down by s.396 \u2013 Therefore, such an order is not in the nature of legislation or delegated legislation \u2013 The fact that, under s.396(5), the Central Government order has to be laid before the Houses of Parliament does not detract from the fact that the order is administrative and not legislative in character \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.13(3). Companies Act, 1956: s.396 \u2013 Essentiality test \u2013 Held: The Central Government has to be \u201csatisfied\u201d, meaning thereby, that it must, on certain objective facts, come to a conclusion that amalgamation between two or more companies is necessary \u2013 This can only be done if the Central Government finds it \u201cessential\u201d, i.e., necessary to do so. Companies Act, 1956: s.396 \u2013 Public interest \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 In the context of compulsory amalgamation of two or more companies, the expression \u201cpublic interest\u201d would mean the welfare of the public or the interest of society as a whole, as contrasted with the \u201cselfish\u201d interest of a group of private individuals \u2013 Thus, \u201cpublic interest\u201d may have regard to the interest of production of goods or services essential to the nation so that they may contribute to the nation\u2019s welfare and progress, and in so doing, may also provide much needed employment \u2013 \u201cPublic interest\u201d in this context would, therefore, mean the combining of resources of two or more companies so as to impact production and consumption of goods and services and employment of persons relatable thereto for the general benefit of the community \u2013 Conversely, any action that impedes promotion of industry or obstructs growth which is in national or public interest would run counter to public interest as mentioned in s.396 of the Act. Companies Act, 1956: s.396(3) \u2013 Amalgamation order \u2013 Compensation \u2013 Right of shareholder or a creditor \u2013 s.396(3) speaks of a shareholder\u2019s or a creditor\u2019s interest in or rights against the company resulting from an amalgamation order \u2013 A shareholder or creditor gets effected by an amalgamation order if the value of his share gets depleted as a result of the amalgamation and if dividends that have been paid to him are likely to come down as a result of the amalgamation \u2013 Likewise, a creditor of a solvent company is directly effected by an amalgamation by which the amount loaned by such creditor becomes, as a result of the amalgamation, less likely to be paid back in time, than if the amalgamation did not take place \u2013 Every shareholder of a company and indeed, every creditor of a company, is concerned only with the \u201ceconomic value\u201d of his share or the loan granted to a company, as the case may be \u2013 The moment the share value, in real terms, is likely to dip, and/or loans granted are likely not to be repaid in time or at all as a result of an amalgamation, such members or creditors of the amalgamating company are equally entitled to be compensated for this economic loss as are the members and creditors of the amalgamated company, depending on the facts of each case \u2013 To the extent to which the interest or rights of such member or creditor are less than his interest or rights against the original company, post amalgamation, he shall be entitled to compensation which is to be assessed. Companies Act, 1956: ss.396(3), 396(3A) \u2013 Compensation to aggrieved person \u2013 The language used in the appeal provision, i.e. s.396(3A), is \u201cany person aggrieved by any assessment of compensation made by the prescribed authority under sub-section (3) may\u2026\u2026 appeal to the Tribunal, and thereupon the assessment of the compensation shall be made by the Tribunal\u201d \u2013 The pre\u0002requisites for the application of sub-section (3A) are that a person first be aggrieved by an \u201cassessment of compensation\u201d \u201cmade\u201d by the prescribed authority \u2013 Where no assessment of compensation whatsoever is made by the prescribed authority, no person can be aggrieved by an order which does not assess any compensation, which may be interfered with by the Appellate Tribunal which must then assess the compensation for itself \u2013 The statute clearly entitles such shareholders and creditors to have compensation assessed first by the prescribed authority and then by the appellate authority \u2013 The orders of \u201cnon-assessment\u201d by the prescribed authority can more appropriately be challenged in judicial review proceedings, in which the High Court, acting under Art.226 of the Constitution of India can, if an infraction of s.396(3) is found, send the matter back to the prescribed authority to determine compensation after which the right of appeal under sub-section (3A) of s.396 would then follow. Companies Act, 1956: s.396 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Compulsory amalgamation of companies by a Central Government\u2019s order in public interest \u2013 NSEL, a 99.99% subsidiary of FTIL, defaulted on nearly 5,600 crore payments to its 13,000 investors \u2013 Trading was suspended in NSEL after payments default \u2013 Order of compulsory amalgamation of NSEL with appellant (FTIL) under s.396 \u2013 Whether each of the conditions precedent for applicability of s.396 applied to the facts of the instant case \u2013 Held: There is no doubt that in July, 2013, as a result of NSEL stopping trading on its exchange, a payment crisis of Rs.5600 crore arose \u2013 The letter addressed by FMC to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs show that immediate reason for amalgamation, according to the FMC was that NSEL, as a corporate entity, was financially and physically incapable of effecting any substantial recovery from defaulting members \u2013 By the time final amalgamation order was passed, emergent situation of 2013 which required emergent step of compulsory amalgamation by the passage of time, disappeared \u2013 Decrees/awards worth Rs.3365 crore were obtained against the defaulters, with Rs. 88 crore crystallised by the committee set up by the High Court, pending acceptance by the High Court, even without using the financial resources of FTIL as an amalgamated company \u2013 What was emergent, and essential, even according to the FMC and the Government in 2013-2014, was, therefore, largely redressed in 2016, by the time the amalgamation order was made \u2013 Therefore, the essentiality test, which is the condition precedent to the applicable to s.396, was not satisfied \u2013 When it comes to public interest as opposed to the private interest of investors/traders who have not been paid, the amalgamation order at several places refers to \u201cessential public interest\u201d as if \u201cessential\u201d goes with \u201cpublic interest\u201d instead of being a separate and distinct condition precedent to the exercise of power under s.396 \u2013 All the expressions used in relation to \u201cpublic interest\u201d have relation only to the businesses of the two companies that are sought to be amalgamated \u2013 The leveraging of combined assets, capital, and reserves is for the purpose of only settling liabilities of certain stakeholders and creditors when the order is read as a whole, and given the fact that the businesses of the two companies were completely different \u2013 So far as achieving economy of scale and efficient administration is concerned, it is difficult to see how this would apply to the fact situation in this case where NSEL is admittedly a company which has stopped functioning as a commodities exchange with no hope of any revival \u2013 Government order itself reflects the net worth of NSEL as INR 8.86 crore despite its capital being INR 60 crore, inasmuch as the total reserve and surplus is a negative figure of INR 51.54 crore \u2013 As against this, FTIL\u2019s balance sheet, as on 31.03.2015, discloses that for the same year, FTIL\u2019s net worth is INR 2779.94 crore \u2013 Also, FTIL paid high dividends to its shareholders while NSEL never paid a single dividend ever since its inception \u2013 This would show that Post amalgamation dividend payable to the shareholders of FTIL is bound to come down \u2013 Correspondingly, the \u2018marketable value\u2019 of such shares will also fall \u2013 The \u2018economic value\u2019 of shares held in FTIL may, post amalgamation, depress the market value of shares held by such shareholder, and would also impact the dividend payable on such shares post amalgamation \u2013 Further no compensation is provided either to the shareholders or creditors of FTIL for the economic loss caused by the amalgamation which is breach of s.396(3) \u2013 This is a case where there is complete non-application of mind by the authority assessing compensation to the rights and interests which the shareholders and creditors of FTIL have and which are referred to in s.396(3) of the Act \u2013 This being the case, it is clear that s.396(3) was not followed either in letter or in spirit \u2013 The amalgamation order is, therefore, ultra vires s.396 and being arbitrary and unreasonable, violative of Art.14 of the Constitution of India."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.319 \u2013 Investigating Agency conducted investigation wherein it found that the appellants were not present at the place of occurrence \u2013 As the appellants were in custody, SHO filed applications before the Magistrate on 1.9.2016 and 28.10.2016 submitting that after investigation since no evidence was found against the appellants, therefore, they may be discharged/released \u2013 Magistrate directed release of the appellants \u2013 Application filed by complainant under s.319 to summon the appellants categorically stating that the appellants were present at the time of the incident \u2013 Trial court summoned the appellants to face trial \u2013 Submission that once the appellants were discharged by the Magistrate on an application submitted by the Investigating Officer/SHO, therefore, thereafter it was not open to the Magistrate to summon the accused to face the trial in exercise of power under s.319 \u2013 Held: The submission is not tenable \u2013 Orders dated 01.09.2016 and 28.10.2016 cannot be said to be the orders discharging the accused \u2013 If the applications submitted by the Investigating Officer/SHO and the orders passed thereon are considered, those were the applications to discharge/release the appellants from custody as at that stage the appellants were in judicial custody \u2013 Therefore, as such, those orders cannot be said to be the orders of discharge in stricto sensu \u2013 Those were the orders discharging the appellants from custody \u2013 Under the circumstances, the submission on behalf of the accused that as they were discharged by the Magistrate and therefore it was not open to the Magistrate to exercise the power under s.319 of the CrPC and to summon the appellants to face the trial, cannot be accepted. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Closure report \u2013 Procedure to be followed before accepting closure report \u2013 Held: Before accepting the closure report, the Magistrate is bound to issue notice to the complainant/original informant and the complainant/ original informant is required to be given an opportunity to submit the protest application and, thereafter, after giving an opportunity to the complainant/original informant, the Magistrate may either accept the closure report or may not accept the closure report and direct to proceed further against those persons for whom the closure report was submitted.

Partition: The case of defendants was that husband of defendant no.1 and father of defendant no.2 and 3 purchased the suit property on 12.12.1948 under a registered sale deed \u2013 Said property was blended into the joint family properties by him \u2013 Thereafter when partition took place said suit property fell into his share \u2013 Plaintiff filed suit for declaration of title on the basis of sale deed \u2013 Trial court and first appellate court held that the said sale deed was only a nominal sale deed and not an out and out sale deed since it was executed as security for loan and never intended to sell the suit property \u2013 High Court allowed the appeal holding that in view of the registered sale deed executed in favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff became the actual owner \u2013 On appeal, held: Father of defendants was not a signatory to the sale deed and therefore it was not binding on him or his heirs \u2013 Even otherwise, in a suit for a declaration on the basis of the registered sale deed, it is always open for the defendant, who is a stranger to the sale deed, to raise a plea that the sale deed was void, fictitious, collusive or not intended to be acted upon and or not binding to him \u2013 Partition deed relied upon by the defendants could be said to be a Palupatti which means list of properties partitioned \u2013 At the most, it can be said to be a family arrangement \u2013 Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the same was not required to be registered \u2013 The execution of this document/ Partition Deed/ Palupatta dated 23.04.1971 was established and proved by examining different witnesses \u2013 Even the plaintiff also categorically admitted that the oral partition took place on 23.04.1971 and he also admitted that 3 to 4 punchayat people were also present \u2013 Therefore, the same even can be used as corroborative evidence as explaining the arrangement made thereunder and conduct of the parties \u2013 So far as sale deed dated 18.05.1973 executed in favour of the plaintiff was concerned, there was serious dispute with respect to consideration paid by the plaintiff \u2013 In the facts and circumstances of the case, the High Court was not justified in interfering with the findings recorded by both the courts below \u2013 The orders passed by both the courts below dismissing the suit are restored."

Administration of criminal justice: Legal assistance to the convict \u2013 Held: The legal assistance provided to the convict at every stage including the stage of hearing on the question of sentence has to be effective and even if the accused has remained silent, the Court would be obliged and duty bound to elicit relevant factors \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 Prisons: It is well recognised worldwide, that owing to the difficult circumstances prevailing in prisons, such as, enforced solitude, inadequate health care, loss of livelihood etc., prisoners often develop mental illness after their admission into prison \u2013 The relevant Prison Rules also recognise the phenomenon of post- conviction mental illness and state that the execution of such persons shall be deferred, pending orders of the Government \u2013 Administration of criminal justice.

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: s.19(1) \u2013 Under Or.26 r.10A CPC, a Court can appoint commission for scientific investigation \u2013 This power can very well be exercised by the NGT also \u2013 NGT while asking expert to give a report is not confined to the four corners of r.10A and its jurisdiction is not shackled by strict terms of Or.21 r.10A by virtue of s.19(1) of the NGT Act \u2013 r.24 of National Green Tribunal (Practice and Procedure) Rules, 2011 empowers the Tribunal to make such orders or give such directions as may be necessary or expedient to give effect to its order or to secure the ends of justice \u2013 There is no lack of jurisdiction in NGT in directing for appointment of a committee and to obtain a report from a Committee \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.26 r.10A \u2013 Commission/Committee \u2013 National Green Tribunal (Practice and Procedure) Rules, 2011 \u2013 r.24. Land Laws: Land tenure system \u2013 Nature of land tenure in the Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya \u2013 In the Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya, the most of the lands are either privately or community owned in which State does not claim any right \u2013 The, private owners of the land as well as community owners have both the surface right as well as sub-soil right \u2013 Thus, the tribals owned the land and also owned the minerals \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.244, sub-clause (2) \u2013 Mines and Minerals. Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, 1957: Applicability of the provisions of Act of 1957 in Tribal areas within the State of Meghalaya, included in Schedule VI of the Constitution \u2013 Schedule VI of the Constitution is a provision for Administration of Tribal areas in the State of Meghalaya \u2013 There is nothing in Schedule VI which may indicate about the inapplicability of Act, 1957 with regard to the Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya \u2013 In the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the year ended 31st March, 2013 also it is clearly stated that Act, 1957 is fully applicable for regulation of mines and regulation of minerals in the State of Meghalaya \u2013 Moreover, there was no notification issued by the President under Para 12A(b) of Schedule VI which empowers the President, with respect to any Act of Parliament, by notification, to direct that it shall not apply to an autonomous district or an autonomous region in the State of Meghalaya, or shall apply to such district or region or any part thereof subject to such exceptions or modifications as he may specify in the notification \u2013 Thus, there is nothing in Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which may indicate about the inapplicability of Act, 1957 with regard to the Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Schedule VI, Para 12A sub-clause (b) \u2013 Mines Act, 1952.

Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, 1957: Whether the order of NGT dated 17.04.2014 directing for complete ban on mining is unsustainable \u2013 Held: The use of natural resources plays major role in carrying out development \u2013 A fine balance has to be maintained in utilisation of natural resources and its conservation and preservation \u2013 By order of NGT dated 17.04.2014, the Rat hole mining/illegal mining was prohibited throughout the State of Meghalaya \u2013 In OA No.73 of 2014 in which said order was passed, sufficient materials were on record including experts report which proved that illegal coal mining in the State of Meghalaya was degrading the environment \u2013 NGT after considering all pleas and materials affirmed order dated 17.04.2014 and refused to withdraw the ban \u2013 No error in the order of NGT reaffirming its ban order. Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, 1957: Whether the complete ban on mining of coal in the State of Meghalaya as directed by NGT deserved to be vacated/modified in the interest of State and Tribals \u2013 Held: Tribals are the owners of the land who carry on mining of coal in their land by which they earn their substantial livelihood \u2013 In event mining operations are undertaken by the tribals or other owners of hills districts of Meghalaya in accordance with mining lease obtained from the State of Meghalaya as per 1957 Act and Rules, 1960, the ban order dated 17.04.2014 of NGT shall not come in its way of carrying mining operations \u2013 The ban order is for the illegal coal mining which was rampant in the State of Meghalaya and the ban order cannot be extended to valid and legal mining as per 1957 Act and 1960 Rules \u2013 Mineral Concession Rules, 1960. Mineral Concession Rules, 1960: Chapter V \u2013 Procedure for grant of mining lease and authority/person, who is competent to grant such lease \u2013 Held: As per the statutory provisions contained in Rules, 1960, especially Chapter V, a mining lease for minerals, which belongs to a private owner or a community owner, it is not the State Government, which is entitled to receive any application or grant any mining lease, but it is the private owner or community owner, who is entitled to grant a lease for mining minerals owned by them. Mineral Concession Rules, 1960: Chapter IV and Chapter V \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Chapter IV deals with grant of mining leases in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the Government and Chapter V deals with procedure for obtaining a prospecting licence or mining lease in respect of land in which the minerals vest in a person other than the Government \u2013 Procedure and manner of applying for mining lease and grant of lease as contained in Chapter IV is not made applicable to the procedure as given in Chapter V except that by virtue of r.45(i) certain conditions of mining lease as contained in r.27 under Chapter IV are made applicable for mining lease under Chapter V. Mineral Concession Rules, 1960: Chapter V \u2013 Whether the State of Meghalaya has any statutory control over the mining of coal from privately owned/community owned land in Hills Districts of State of Meghalaya \u2013 Held: State of Meghalaya has jurisdiction and power to ensure that no mining of coal should take place except when a mining lease is granted under the Rules, 1960 \u2013 The statutory scheme delineated by s.13(2)(f) and the Rules, 1960 clearly contemplate grant of mining lease, with regard to both the categories of land, i.e., land in which minerals vest in the Government, and the land in which minerals vest in a person other than the Government \u2013 Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, 1957 \u2013 s.13(2)(f). Mines and Minerals: Jurisdiction of NGT \u2013 Constitution of committee \u2013 Whether NGT had any jurisdiction to constitute committees to submit reports, to implement the orders of NGT, to monitor storage/transportation; of minerals and to prepare action plan for restoration of environment and whether the NGT committed error in directing for constitution of fund, namely, Meghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund \u2013 Held: There is no lack of jurisdiction in the NGT to direct for appointment of committee or to obtain a report from a committee \u2013 A Fund has been constituted by NGT, namely, \u201cMeghalaya Environment Protection and Restoration Fund\u201d \u2013 NGT could have passed any order or direction to secure ends of justice which power especially conferred by Rule 24 \u2013 Direction to constitute Fund is thus also saved under such power \u2013 National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Mines and Minerals: Judicial powers of NGT \u2013 Whether NGT by constituting Committees has delegated essential judicial powers to the Committees \u2013 Held: The various instances where the NGT directed for report or investigation and submission of report by committees were with the object of ensuring the implementation of the orders passed by it and to decide the environmental issues raised before it \u2013 In no manner, constitution of committee can be said to be delegation of essential judicial powers of the NGT to the committee \u2013 The Katakey committee was constituted by NGT on 31.08.2018 \u2013 The constitution of the committee and its functions entrusted were with the object to implement the orders passed by NGT \u2013 For the restoration of environment, NGT by its order dated 31.08.2018 has directed the committee to submit its action plan and reports by e-mail \u2013 NGT, thus, had kept complete control on all steps which were required to be taken by the committee and issued directions from time to time \u2013 Thus, the submission that the essential judicial powers of the NGT had been delegated to the committee is not tenable \u2013 The matter being pending before NGT of acts of the committee are under direct control of NGT and if the committee oversteps in any direction the same can very well be corrected by NGT on the matter being brought before it \u2013 National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. Mines and Minerals: Whether constitution of the committee encroaches the constitutional scheme of the Tribal areas under Art.244(2) and Art.275(1) and Schedule VI of the Constitution \u2013 Para 3 of the Schedule VI enumerates the powers of the District Council and Regional Council to make laws \u2013 The powers of the District and Regional Councils are enumerated under Para 3 \u2013 In the directions of NGT to constitute committee for transportation of extracted minerals or for preparing time bound action to deal with the restoration of environment and to ensure its implementation, there is no interference in the powers of the District or Regional Councils \u2013 Action plan for restoration of environment is consequence of NGT finding out that an unregulated coal mining has damaged environment and has caused the pollution including water pollution \u2013 It is not case of the appellant that District and Regional Councils have framed any law for restoration of environment which is being breached by the committee or its acts \u2013 The District and Regional Councils are free to exercise all their powers and the committee constituted by NGT is only concerned with the Environmental degradation and illegal coal mining \u2013 The committees\u2019 report or direction of NGT in no manner encroaches upon the administration of Tribal areas by the District and Regional Councils \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.244(2), 275(1). Mines and Minerals: Whether direction to deposit Rs.100/- crores by the State of Meghalaya by order dated 04.01.2019 of NGT is sustainable \u2013 NGT by its order dated 04.01.2019 had directed the State of Meghalaya to deposit an amount of Rs.100 Crores with the Central Pollution Control Board, which was to be spent for restoration of environment \u2013 The State of Meghalaya aggrieved by this direction filed appeal \u2013 Held: The amount, which has been directed by NGT to be deposited by State of Meghalaya is neither a penalty nor a fine imposed on the State \u2013 The amount has been directed to be deposited for carrying out steps regarding restoration of environment \u2013 The said amount cannot be said to be amount of damages to be paid by the State \u2013 State of Meghalaya has very limited source of revenue and putting an extra burden on the State of Meghalaya to make payment of Rs.100 Crores from its own financial resources and budgetary amount may cause great hardship to the State of Meghalaya \u2013 In the ends of justice, the direction of NGT dated 04.01.2019 is modified to the extent that State is permitted to transfer an amount of Rs.100 Crores from the amount lying in the MEPRF to the Central Pollution Control Board \u2013 The Central Pollution Control Board shall utilise the amount of Rs.100 Crores only for restoration of the environment. Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act, 1957: ss.4(1), 21 \u2013 Coal \u2013 Vesting in Government \u2013 Whether NGT\u2019s order dated 31.03.2016 that after 15.05.2016, all remaining coal shall vest in the State of Meghalaya is sustainable \u2013 By order dated 31.03.2016, NGT had permitted transportation of coal till 15.5.2016 under terms and conditions as enumerated therein and further contemplated that no coal in any form whatsoever shall be permitted to be transported after 15.05.2016 on which date the entire remaining coal shall vest in the State Government and shall be disposed of in accordance with law \u2013 Propriety of NGT\u2019s order dated 31.03.2016 \u2013 Held: Coal mining was illegally going on in the Hills District of State of Meghalaya without there being any mining lease \u2013 The entire mining was, thus, is clear in contravention of s.4(1) of Act, 1957 which attracted penalties under s.21 \u2013 The present is not a case where any kind of penalty was imposed on the miners except that the amount of royalty as payable on mining of coal was collected by the State as penalty \u2013 State Government has power under s.21(5). to recover from such person the minerals so raised, or, where such material has already been disposed of, the price thereof, and may also recover from such person, rent, royalty or tax, as the case may be, but it is for State Government to exercise its power under s.21(5) by way of penalty \u2013 The NGT did not give any reason as to how coal shall automatically vest in the State \u2013 The right of recovery of mineral as contemplated under s.21(5) would not amount to say that proprietary right of owner of the minerals is lost rather State under s.21(5) exercises its power to recover the mineral which has been raised without any lawful authority \u2013 Thus, coal extracted and lying in open after 15.05.2016 was not automatically vested in the State and the owner of the coal or the person who has mined the coal shall have the proprietary right in the mineral which shall not be lost. Mines and Minerals: Coal \u2013 Whether assessed and unassessed coal which has already been extracted and lying in different Districts of Meghalaya be permitted to be transported \u2013 Mechanism to be adopted for disposal of such coal \u2013 Held: Coal being major mineral and useful for different industries and projects, appropriate disposal of extracted coal is of a paramount importance \u2013 Entire extracted coal lying at various places is directed to be taken over by Coal India Ltd, a Government of India unit, who may dispose of the same as per its normal method of disposal \u2013 For all extracted coal lying at different places, it is the State, which is the receiver-cum-custodian of the coal \u2013 The State having carried out the assessment of the coal lying in the said four districts including the details of the quantities and the details of owners being available with it, it may ensure that the entire coal are handed over to the Coal India Ltd., as per the mode and manner to be formulated by Katakey Committee, in consultation with officers of the Coal India Ltd. and State of Meghalaya \u2013 Commissioner and Secretary of the State in the Department of Mining and Geology alongwith the officers of Coal India Ltd. are directed to deliberate with the Katakey committee to finalise a comprehensive plan for transportation and handing over of the coal to Coal India Ltd. for disposal/auction as per rules of Coal India Ltd. \u2013 It is for the Coal India Ltd. to decide as to venue, where they shall receive the coal and finalise the process of disposal and auction of the coal \u2013 It shall be the duty of the State of Meghalaya and its officers especially Deputy Commissioner of the area concerned to enter details of quantity of the coal, name of the owner and place from where it is collected \u2013 State of Meghalaya shall be entitled to royalty and payment towards MERP Fund as well as taxes out of the price of the coal \u2013 The Coal India Ltd. after taking its expenses for transportation with 10% of price of the coal shall remit the entire amount to the State and State after deducting the royalty and payment to the MERP Fund and taxes would pay back the balance of the amount to the owner \u2013 The coal, which has been seized by the State in illegal transportation or illegal mining for which different cases have been registered by the State shall be dealt by the State in accordance with s.21 of the Act, 1957 and on being satisfied, the State can take a decision to recover the entire quantity of coal so illegally raised without lawful authority and the said cases has to be separately dealt with in accordance with law \u2013 All I.A.s filed by different applicants seeking order of transportation of the different quantities disposed of \u2013 The Katakey committee in consultation with State of Meghalaya and officers of Coal India Ltd. would finalise appropriate mode and manner to affect the transport and disposal of the coal in the above manner. Mines Act, 1952: Mines Act, 1952 contains various provisions regarding inspection of mining operation and management of mines \u2013 The provisions of the Mines Act, 1952 are mandatory to be followed before working a mine \u2013 The regulations namely Coal Mines Regulations, 2017 also contains several regulatory provisions which need to be followed while working a mine by a mining lease holder \u2013 The enforcement of Mines Act, 1952 and the Regulations, 2017 have to be ensured by the State in the public interest. Mines and Minerals: Coal mining in the Hills Districts of the State of Meghalaya \u2013 As per statutory regime brought in force by notification dated 15.01.2016 issued under Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, environmental clearance is required for a project of coal for mining of any extent of area \u2013 While implementing statutory regime for carrying mining operations in the Hills Districts of the State of Meghalaya, the State of Meghalaya has to ensure compliance of not only MMDR Act, 1957 but Mines Act, 1952 as well as Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 Judicial Appreciation: Committee \u2013 Work appreciated \u2013 The Katakey committee and its various members and participants have done a commendable job in studying and examining various aspects of environment in the State of Meghalaya and several valuable suggestions have been given by the committee, which are also being implemented to mitigate the suffering of the citizens consequent to the illegal coal mined."

Judicial notice: Judicial notice taken of recent devastation in Kerala which had taken place due to heavy rains compounded by such unbridled construction activities resulting in colossal loss of human life and property due to such unauthorised activity \u2013 In the instant case, permission granted by the Panchayat was illegal and void \u2013 No such development activity could have taken place in prohibited zone \u2013 In view of the findings of the Enquiry Committee, directions passed to remove all the structures within a period of one month \u2013 Environment Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 Kerala Municipality Building Rules, 1999 \u2013 rr.16 and 23."

Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007: r.12 \u2013 Rejection of declared value \u2013 Essential requirement \u2013 Reasonable doubt of proper officer as to transactional value \u2013 The proper officer should have reasonable doubt as to the transactional value on account of truth or accuracy of the value declared in relation to the imported goods \u2013 Proper officer must ask the importer of such goods, further information which may include documents or evidence \u2013 On receiving such information or in the absence of response from the importer, the proper officer has to apply his mind and decide whether or not reasonable doubt as to the truth or accuracy of the value so declared persists \u2013 When the proper officer does not have reasonable doubt, the goods are cleared on the declared value \u2013 When the doubt persists, sub-rule (1) to r.3 is not applicable and transaction value is determined in terms of rr.4 to 9 of the 2007 Rules \u2013 The importer has to be given opportunity of hearing before the proper officer finally decides the transactional value in terms of rr.4 to 9 of the 2007 Rules. Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 \u2013 r.12 \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Held: The choice of words deployed in r.12 of the 2007 Rules are significant and of much consequence \u2013 The Legislature did not use the expression \u201creason to believe\u201d or \u201csatisfaction\u201d or such other positive terms as a pre-condition on the part of the proper officer \u2013 The expression \u201creason to believe\u201d which would have required the proper officer to refer to facts and figures to show existence of positive belief on the undervaluation or lower declaration of the transaction value \u2013 The expression \u201creason to doubt\u201d as a sequitur would require a different threshold and examination \u2013 It cannot be equated with the requirements of positive reasons to believe, for the word \u2018doubt\u2019 refers to un-certainty and irresolution reflecting suspicion and apprehension Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported Goods) Rules, 2007 \u2013 r.18 \u2013 Case of appellants that respondents\u0002authorities discarded the declared transactional value and recomputed the consignment value by compelling the appellant to give a letter of consent to assessment/valuation by custom authorities \u2013 Contention of the respondents was predicated on letter of appellants dated 6th March, 2017 that the appellants did not seek provisional assessment of the bill of entry and had accepted and paid duty on the valuation done by the customs authorities \u2013 The contention is rejected since this letter exposited the predicament faced by the appellants as it stated that the appellants were in urgent requirement and wanted clearance of the goods \u2013 Appellants had earlier also written several letters requesting for clearance of the imported consignment of aluminium scrap on the declared transaction value pointing out therein that on account of delay in the clearance of the imported consignments, the appellants and its sister concern had been compelled to pay excess duty of over Rs.25 crores \u2013 Therefore, respondent authorities had compelled and forced the appellant to furnish letter dated 6th March, 2017 thereby waiving of its right to provisional assessment and accepting valuation in terms of rr.4 to 10. Customs Act, 1962: Valuation Alerts \u2013 The Valuation Alerts are issued by the Director General of Valuation based on the monitoring of valuation trends of sensitive commodities with a view to take corrective measures \u2013 They provide guidance to the field formation in valuation matters \u2013 They help ensure uniform practice, smooth functioning and prevent evasion and short payment of duty \u2013 However, they should not be construed as interfering with the discretion of the assessment authority who is required to pass an Assessment Order in the given factual matrix \u2013 Declared valuation can be rejected based upon the evidence which qualifies and meets the criteria of \u2018certain reasons\u2019 \u2013 Besides, the opinion formed must be reasonable \u2013 Reference to foreign journals for the price quoted in exchanges etc., to find out the correct international price of concerned goods would be relevant but reliance can be placed on such material only when the adjudicating authority had conducted enquiries and ascertained details with reference to the goods imported which are identical or similar and \u2018certain reasons\u2019 exists and justifies detailed investigation \u2013 These reasons are to be recorded and if requested disclosed/ communicated to the importer \u2013 Valuation alerts could be relied upon for default valuation computation under the Rules."

Companies Act, 1956: s.130 \u2013 The submission on behalf of the appellant was that all the three provisions, viz., s.130, ss.211/ 212 and ss.241/242 operate in different fields and in different circumstances and they are in the different Chapters and, therefore, any observation made while passing the orders with respect to a particular provision may not be considered while passing the order under relevant provisions is concerned \u2013 Held: All the three provisions are required to be considered conjointly \u2013 While passing an order in a particular provision, the endeavour should be to see that the orders passed under other provisions of the Companies Act are given effect to, and/or in furtherance of the order/orders passed under other Sections \u2013 Therefore, the observations made while passing order under ss.241/242 of the Act can be said to be relevant observations for passing the order under s.130 of the Act \u2013 Even otherwise in the order passed by the Tribunal under s.130 of the Act, there is a specific observation made by the Tribunal with respect to mismanagement of the affairs of the company, and even with respect to the relevant earlier accounts prepared in a fraudulent manner. Companies Act, 1956: s.130, proviso \u2013 Compliance of \u2013 Whether order passed under s.130 was in violation of natural justice and the proviso of s.130 was not complied with \u2013 Held: As per proviso to s.130 of the Act before passing the order under s.130 of the Act, the Tribunal is required to issue notice to the Central Government, Income Tax Authorities, SEBI or any other statutory regulatory body or authorities concerned or any \u201cother person concerned\u201d and is required to take into consideration the representation, if any made \u2013 The \u201cother person concerned\u201d is as such not defined. While passing the order under s.130 of the Act, there shall be reopening of the books of accounts and re-casting of the financial statements of the company and therefore the Board of Directors of the company may make a grievance \u2013 The erstwhile directors cannot represent the company as they are suspended pursuant to the earlier order passed under s.242 of the Act \u2013 In the instant case, the erstwhile directors of the company represented before the Tribunal and they opposed the application under s.130 of the Act \u2013 Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it cannot be said that the order passed by the Tribunal is per se in violation of the principle of natural justice as alleged. Companies Act, 1956: ss.241 and 242 \u2013 Submission of the appellant that order dated 01.10.2018 passed under ss.241/242 of the Companies Act is an interim order and the same is not a final order suspending the directors and the erstwhile board of directors of the company, and therefore the observations made in order dated 01.10.2018 cannot be considered, has no substance \u2013 Order dated 01.10.2018 suspending the erstwhile directors of the company including the appellant is not challenged by way of an appeal before an appropriate appellate Tribunal/Court and till date stands and remains in operation. Companies Act, 1956: s.130 \u2013 Reliance placed on subsequent report of RBI \u2013 Held: It is required to be noted, independent to the subsequent report of the RBI, there is specific finding with respect to the mismanagement and the fraudulent accounts \u2013 Therefore, subsequent report of the RBI report can be taken note of while upholding the order passed by the Tribunal under s.130 of the Act \u2013 Since a larger public interest is involved and reopening of the books of accounts and recasting of financial statements of the said companies is required to be carried out in the larger public interest, to find out the real truth, and both the conditions precedent while invoking power under s.130 of the Act are satisfied/complied with, therefore in the facts and circumstances of the case, the order passed by the Tribunal passed under s.130 of the Companies Act not to be interfered with."

No.96448 of 2017 in W.P.(C)No. 743 of 2017 wherein it was permitted to hold mop-up counselling for unfilled super-speciality seats lying vacant \u2013 Held: Petitioners sought a general extension of time not on account of any particular difficulty faced by any individual college or university but generally on the ground that a large number of seats for P.G. courses were lying vacant \u2013 Merely because the seats were lying vacant, is not a ground to grant extension of time and grant further opportunity to fill up vacant seats \u2013 The fixed time schedule to fill up seats must be followed \u2013 Insofar as order dated 11.10.2017 is concerned, it was related to super-speciality seats and Supreme Court had extended the date for counselling on the request of the Central Government \u2013 Further, the said order was only applicable to the said academic year \u2013 In the instant case, extension cannot be granted just because some seats were lying vacant without any justification.

Tech Courses, for the block period 2016-17 to 2018-19 \u2013 The said fee structure was challenged by the respondent institutions before the High Court \u2013 Single Judge of the High Court remanded the matter to the TAFRC for reconsideration \u2013 Pursuant thereto, the Committee granted some escalations, however, the same was challenged again \u2013 Thereafter, the High Court redetermined the fee structure for the block period itself \u2013 Aggrieved, the State and the fee Regulatory Committee assailed the same unsuccessfully before the Division Bench of the High Court \u2013 On appeal, held: Judicial review lies against the decision-making process and not the merits of the decision itself \u2013 If the decision-making process is flawed, inter-alia by violation of the basic principles of natural justice, is ultra-vires the powers of the decision maker, takes into consideration irrelevant materials or excludes relevant materials, admit materials behind the back of the person to be affected or is such that no reasonable persons would have taken such decision in the circumstances, the Court may step in to correct the error by setting aside such decision and requiring the decision maker to take a fresh decision in accordance with the law \u2013 However, the Court, in the garb of judicial review, cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the decision maker and make the decision itself \u2013 It cannot act as an appellate authority of the TAFRC \u2013 Further, TAFRC is a statutory  body headed by a retired High Court Judge, consists of domain experts from various fields including two from the finance sector, one of which is from the Government \u2013 The Court should avoid to interfere with the recommendations of an expert body, which is accepted by the Government, unless it suffers from the vice of arbitrariness, irrationality, perversity or violates any provisions of the law under which it was constituted \u2013 In the instant case, as demonstrated from the available records none of the grounds set out by the High Court can be considered as making out an exceptional case to warrant usurpation of the decision making jurisdiction of the TAFRC by the High Court \u2013 Thus, the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering with recommendation of the TAFRC \u2013 The orders of the High Court set aside \u2013 Judicial Review."

Jharkhand Excise Act, 1915 \u2013 s.90 \u2013 Revenue Board notification dated 06.11.2012 \u2013 r.106 (Tha) \u2013 Nature of tax or excise duty \u2013 The Board of Revenue u/s.90 of the Act chose to levy fee on the import of rectified spirit by notification dated 06.11.2012 \u2013 Appellant-State contended that the levy of charges or impost is neither in the nature of a tax nor excise duty \u2013 Held: There is merit in the contention of appellant-State that the impost is neither in the nature of a tax nor excise duty but it is towards the charges by whatever name, for regulating the production of potable liquor to preserve public health and morality including for parting with its rights or privileges regarding manufacture, supply or sale of potable liquor or intoxicating liquor and to regulate the use of imported rectified spirit for production and sale of potable liquor \u2013 In such a case, the State need bear no quid pro quo to the services rendered to the licencee for production of foreign liquor (IMFA).
