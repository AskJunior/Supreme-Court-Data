Administrative Law - Natural Justice - Bias - Effect of - Held: Bias is an insegregable facet of the concept of natural Justice as a genus - Question of bias would arise depending on the facts and circumstances of the case - Challenge of A bias, when sustained, makes the whole proceeding or order a nullity, the same being coram non-judice.
