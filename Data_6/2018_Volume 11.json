SCR 1 needsreconsideration \u2013 In Para 82 of Ismail Faruqui case, theConstitutional Bench observed \u201cA mosque is not an essential partof the practice of the religion of Islam and namaz (prayer) byMuslims can be offered anywhere, even in open.\u201d \u2013 Held: Majorityopinion (Per Ashok Bhushan, J. [for himself and Dipak Misra, CJI.]),the statement that a mosque is not an essential part of the practiceof religion of Islam was in context of issue as to whether the mosque,which was acquired by Act of 1993 had immunity from acquisition\u2013 Constitution Bench had held that while offer of prayer or worshipis a religious practice, its offering at every location where suchprayers can be offered would not be an essential or integral part ofsuch religious practice unless the place has a particular significancefor that religion so as to form an essential or integral part thereof \u2013What Court meant was that unless the place of offering of prayerhas a particular significance so that any hindrance to worship mayviolate right under Arts.25 and 26, any hindrance to offering ofprayer at any place shall not affect rights under Arts.25 and 26 \u2013The phrase \u201cparticular significance\u201d was used by the ConstitutionBench only in context of immunity from acquisition \u2013 No case wasmade out to refer the Constitution Bench judgment in Ismail Faruquicase for reconsideration \u2013 (Per S. Abdul Nazeer, J.) (Dissenting)The questionable observations in Ismail Faruqui case certainlypermeated the impugned judgment \u2013 Thus, the impugned judgmentcan be claimed to be both expressly and inherently affected by thequestionable observations made in Ismail Faruqui \u2013 Further, IsmailFaruqui prima facie leads a different approach regarding theapplication of essential and/or integral test which also needs to beresolved as a matter of constitutional significance \u2013 Ismail Faruqui needs to be brought in line with the authoritative pronouncementsin Shirur Mutt and other decisions \u2013 In view of constitutionalimportance and significance of the issues involved, the followingquestions referred to a larger Bench: (a) Whether in the light ofShirur Mutt and other aforementioned cases, an essential practicecan be decided without a detailed examination of the beliefs, tenetsand practice of the faith in question (b) Whether the test fordetermining the essential practice is both essentiality and integrality(c) Does Art.25, only protect belief and practices of particularsignificance of a faith or all practices regarded by the faith asessential (d) Do Arts.15, 25 and 26 (read with Art.14) allow thecomparative significance of faiths to be undertaken \u2013 Religiousinstitutions \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.25 and 26 \u2013 Acquisitionof Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993.Acquisition of Certain Area at Ayodhya Act, 1993 \u2013 Plea ofres judicata \u2013 The issues which have been framed in the suits givingrise to these appeals were different issues which cannot be said tobe directly and substantially in issue in Ismail Faruqui\u2019s case \u2013Non-fulfilment of this condition itself is sufficient to reject the pleaof res judicata."
