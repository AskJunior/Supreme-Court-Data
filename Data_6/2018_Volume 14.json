AInterpretation of statutes: Harmonious construction \u2013Copyright Act, 1957 \u2013 Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act,1997 \u2013 Held: Both the Copyright Act as well as the TRAI Act arecentral enactments which do not expressly provide that the oneoverrides the other \u2013 In this situation, both the Acts are to beharmonized in the event of any clash/conflict between the two sothat both may be given effect to \u2013 Since the Telegraph Authority,acting under the Telegraph Act and the Indian Wireless TelegraphyAct, is required to act in public interest, the jurisdiction of the saidAuthority is left untrammeled by the provisions of the TRAI Act \u2013 Itcan thus be seen that TRAI and the Telegraph Authority both act inpublic interest \u2013 The TRAI Act, the Telegraph Act and the IndianWireless Telegraphy Act, being statutes in pari materia, form a Code,insofar as wireless telegraphy and broadcasting is concerned \u2013 Ifin exercise of its regulatory power under the TRAI Act, TRAI were toimpinge upon compensation payable for copyright, the best way inwhich both statutes can be harmonized is to state that, the TRAI Act,being a statute conceived in public interest, which is to serve theinterest of both broadcasters and consumers, must prevail, to theextent of any inconsistency, over the Copyright Act which is an Actwhich protects the property rights of broadcasters \u2013 Therefore, tothe extent royalties/compensation payable to the broadcasters underthe Copyright Act are regulated in public interest by TRAI under theTRAI Act, the former shall give way to the latter."

(b) where any enterprise or group of enterprises,which enjoys dominant position, abuses the said dominant position;and (c) regulating the combination of enterprises by means of mergersor amalgamations to ensure that such mergers or amalgamationsdo not become anti-competitive or abuse the dominant position whichthey can attain \u2013 The purpose of CCI is to eliminate such practiceswhich are having adverse effect on the competition, to promote andsustain competition and to protect the interest of the consumers andensure freedom of trade, carried on by the other participants, inIndia \u2013 For the purpose of conducting an inquiry, the CCI isempowered to call any person for rendering assistance and/orproduce the records/material for arriving at even the prima facieopinion.Competition Act, 2002: s.26(1) \u2013 Writ petition against orderunder s.26(1) of 2002 Act \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 RJIL filedinformation under the Act alleging anti-competitive agreement/cartelhaving been formed by three major telecom operators (IDOs) alongwith COAI \u2013 CCI exercised its right under s.26 and held that primafacie case existed and an investigation was warranted into the matterand directed Director General to cause investigation in the case \u2013In writ petition, High Court was called upon to decide as to whetherthe jurisdiction of the CCI was entirely excluded or to what extentthe CCI could exercise its jurisdiction in these cases when the mattercould be dealt with any another regulator, namely, the TRAI \u2013 Held:When such jurisdictional issues arose, the writ petition would clearlybe maintainable \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.226 \u2013 Judicial review.Competition Act, 2002: s.26(1) \u2013 Whether the High Courtcould give its findings on merits \u2013 Held: Once the order under s.26(1)of the 2002 Act is held to be administrative in nature and that it wasmerely a prima facie opinion directing the Director General to carrythe investigation, the High Court was not competent to adjudge thevalidity of such an order on merits \u2013 The observations of the HighCourt giving findings on merits, therefore, were not appropriate \u2013At the same time, since the order of the High Court is upheld on theaspect that the CCI could exercise jurisdiction only after proceedingsunder the TRAI Act had concluded/attained finality, the ultimatedirection given by the High Court quashing the order passed by theCCI is not liable to be interfered with as such an exercise carriedout by the CCI was premature.Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997: Salientfeatures of the Act, discussed."

is no justification for makingrecommendation in paragraph No. 5 of the impugned judgment \u2013Thus, recommendations are set aside. s. 12 \u2013 Nominated members in the Legislative Assembly \u2013 Rightto vote in the matter of budget and no-confidence motion againstthe Government \u2013 Held: Section 12(1) provides that all questions atany sitting of the Legislative Assembly of the Union territory shallbe determined by a majority of votes of the members present andvoting other than the Speaker or person acting as such \u2013 When theexpression used is votes of members present, obviously the membersof the Assembly both elected and nominated person has to becounted, while interpreting s. 12(1) the nominated members cannotbe excluded \u2013 Thus, the statutory provision does not give indicationthat nominated members have no right to vote on budget and noconfidence motion against the Government."
