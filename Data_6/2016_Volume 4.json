(c) of the SEBI Act and Regs 3 and 4(1) of the 2003 Regulations - On appeal, held: It is clear from the transactions that demat account holders were not genuine, they were henami!fictitious and shares were purchased on behalf of someone, who had financed these demat account holders, at a price less than the market price of the shares - Demat account holders used addresses of others and signed in a fishy manner in their demat accounts - Entire chain of the transactions of shares was against the interest of small investors - Transfer of shares did not comply with the requirements of the provision of either s. 13 or s. 2(i) of SCRA - Thus, Whole Time Member as well as Adjudicating Officer rightly held the off market trading indulged into by respondents to be per se illegal, not fair and in violation of the Act as well as Regulations. Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 - Nature of- Held: ls a special law to regulate the sale and purchase of shares and securities - Thus, prevails over the provisions of the Contract Act, 1872 and Sale of Goods Act, 1930, insofar as the matters specifically dealt with by the 1956 Act.

The limitation is self-restraint, nothing more.\u201d Since Section 397 Cr.P.C. is attracted against all orders other than interlocutory, a coutrary view would limit the availability of inherent powers under Section 482 Cr.P.C. only to petty interlocutory orders, which is wholly unwarranted and undesirable.

This act of the Authority would amply demonstrate that there was no unhindered, peaceful and continuous possession of the suit land. [Para 22] {599-B-C]2.

The present appeal arises out of civil proceedings filed in the form of a suit by the respondent and once it is found that the respondent has not been able to prove title by adverse possession, no such aspects, not coming within the scope of the suit proceedings, can be looked into.
