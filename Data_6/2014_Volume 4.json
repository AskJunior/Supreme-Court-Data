Res judicata: Constructive res judicata - Applicability to writ proceedings - Discussed. Constructive res judicata - Grant of plot of land under  1926 Rules - Request of appellant for fresh grant declined by the Lieutenant Governor - Writ petition - High Court took the view that the occupants need not be evicted from the land only so long as the same was not needed for any public purpose - Before the High Court, appellant did not raise  contention that regardless whether a fresh grant was made in their favour or not and regardless whether or not a second renewal was permissible under the 1926 Regulations, they had acquired a vested right under the 1966 Regulation to continue in occupation of the land till such time one of the  contingencies enumerated under Regulation 151 of the said Regulations arose disentitling them from continuing in occupation of the land - Said contention was available to the occupants which could and indeed ought to have been raised by them at that stage - Inasmuch as the occupants did not  urge such contention in the previous round of litigation they are debarred from doing so in the instant proceedings on the principles of constructive res judicata - Andaman and Nicobar Islands (Land Tenure) Regulation, 1926.

HUMAN RIGHTS: A 8 c Hate speech - Steps taken by Government - Held: The Indian legal framework has enacted several statutory provisions dealing with the subject - In addition thereto, the Central Government has always provided support to the State Governments and Union Territory administrations in several o ways to maintain communal harmony in the country and in case of need the Central Government also sends advisories in this regard from time to time - The Central Government has .also issued revised guidelines to promote communal harmony to)he States and Union Territories in 2008 which E provides inter-alia that strict action should be taken against anyone inflaming passions and stroking communal tension by intemperate and inflammatory speeches and utterances -Penal Code, 1860 makes offences related to religion punishable - Similarly, intentional public humiliation of F members of the 'Scheduled Castes' and 'Scheduled Tribes' is penalized under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 - R.P. Act also restrains any political party or the candidate to create feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India by making such an act a punishable offence - Article G 20(2) of the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights, 1966 (ICCPR) restrains advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that may \u00b7result in incitement for discrimination, hostility or violence classifying it as prohibited by law - Similarly Articles 4 and 6 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 1965 (ICERD) prohibits the elements of hate speech and mandates the member states to make a law prohibiting any kind of hate speech through a suitable 8 framework of law - Penal Code, 1860 - ss. 124A, 153A, 1538, 295A, 298, 505(2) - Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 - Representation of People Act - ss.123(3), 125. Hate speech - Duty of courts - Held: Courts must apply C the hate speech prohibition objectively -The question courts must ask is whether a reasonable person, aware of the context and circumstances, would view the expression as exposing the protected group to hatred - The key is to determine the likely effect of the expression on its audience, keeping in mind D the legislative objectives to reduce or eliminate discrimination. JUDICIAL INTERVENTION: Constitution clearly provides for separation of powers and the court merely applies the law that it gets from the legislature - If there is a law, E Judges can certainly enforce it, but Judges cannot create a law and seek to enforce it - The court cannot re-write, re-cast or reframe the legislation for the very good reason that it has no power to legislate -However, of lately, judicial activism of the superior courts in India has raised pubic eyebrow time and again - The directions are issued by the Court only when F there has been a total vacuum in law, i.e. complete absence of active law to provide for the effective enforcement of a basic human right - In case there is inaction on the part of the executive for whatsoever reason, the court has stepped in, in exercise of its constitutional obligations to enforce the law - G In case of vacuum of legal regime to deal with a particular situation the court may issue guidelines to provide absolution till such time as the legislature acts to perform its role by enacting proper legislation to cover the field - Thus, direction can be issued only in a situation where the will of the elected legislature has not yet been expressed - Judicial activism - Judicial review. Words and phrases: Hate speech - Meaning and its effect - Held: Hate speech is an effort to marginalise individuals based on their membership in a group - Using expression that exposes the group to hatred, hate speech seeks to delegitimise group members in the eyes of the majority, reducing their social standing and acceptance within society - Hate speech, therefore, rises beyond causing distress to individual group members - It can have a societal impact - Hate speech lays the groundwork for later, broad attacks on vulnerable that can range from discrimination, to ostracism, segregation, deportation, violence and, in the most extreme cases, to genocide - Hate speech a/so impacts a protected group's ability to respond to the substantive ideas under debate, thereby placing a serious barrier to their full participation in our democracy."

        "HeadNote": "CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973: c s. 439 - Bail - Case triable by Court of Session - Power of Court of Session and High Court to grant bail till committal of case to Court of Session - Held: There is no provision in Cr. P. C. or elsewhere, curtailing the power of either of superior courts to entertain and decide pleas for bail - A substantial period may inevitably intervene between a Magistrate taking  cognizance of an offence triable by Court of Session and its committal to such court - During this interregnum, s. 439 can be invoked for purpose of pleading for bail - Since severe restrictions have been placed on power of Magistrate to grant bail to a person accused of an offence punishable by death  or imprisonment for life, a superior court such as Court of Session, should not be incapacitated from considering a bail application especially keeping in perspective that its powers are comparatively unfettered uls 439 - In the instant case, offence had already been committed to Court of Session - F Applicant prayed for surrender to High Court and for grant of bail - Single Judge erred in law in holding that he was devoid of jurisdiction so far as application presented to him by appellant was concerned - Once prayer for surrender is accepted, appellant would come into custody of court within  contemplation of s. 439 - Impugned order is, accordingly, set aside - Single Judge shall consider appellant's plea for surrendering to court and grant of bail - Constitution of India, 1950 - Art. 21.CRIMINAL LAW: Expressions, 'arrest', 'custody' and 'detention' - Explained - Held: The terms 'custody', 'detention' or 'arrest' have not been defined in CrPC - However, an analysis of case law indicates that these are sequentially cognate concepts- 'Custody' and 'arrest' are not synonyms even though in every arrest there is custody but not vice versa. A B ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE: Role of Public Prosecutor and hearing to complainant! C informant/ aggrieved party - Held: The role of Public Prosecutor is to uphold the law and put forth a sound prosecution - Presence of a private lawyer would inexorably undermine fairness and impartiality which must be hallmark, attribute and distinction of every proper prosecution - No D vested right is granted to a complainant or informant or aggrieved party to directly conduct a prosecution - Constant or even frequent interference in prosecution should not be encouraged as it will have a deleterious impact on its impartiality - However, where Magistrate or Sessions Judge E is of the opinion that prosecution is likely to fail, prudence would prompt that complainant or informant or aggrieved party be given an informal hearing. PRECEDENT: Expression, 'per incuriam' - Explained - Held: It is necessary to give a salutary clarion caution to all courts, including High Courts, to be extremely careful and circumspect in concluding a judgment of Supreme Court to be per incuriam - An earlier judgment cannot be seen as per incuriam a later judgment as the latter if numerically stronger only then it would overrule the former- In the instant case, in the impugned order, single Judge of High Court followed incorrect and misleading editorial note in the cited law journal without apprising himself of the context in which Rashmi Rekha was wrongly reported to hold Niranjan Singh per incuriam - Rashmi Rekha dealt with anticipatory bail ul s 438, Cr. P. C. and only tangentially with ss. 437 and 439, Cr. P. C. - In the factual matrix of the instant case, Niranjan Singh is the precedent of relevance and not Gurbaksh Singh  Sibbia nor any other decision where the scope and sweep of anticipatory bail was at the fulcrum of the conundrum - Law reporting.

        "HeadNote": "Service Law - Judicial Service - Entitlement to continuation! extension of service beyond the age of 58 years - Manner of determination - Bihar Superior Judicial Service - Denial of extension to respondent-Judicial Officer beyond the age of 58 years - If justified - Held: The entitlement to continuation! extension of service of a judicial officer beyond the age of 58 has to be determined on the basis of the service record of the particular officer under consideration and not on a comparative assessment with the record of other officers - Even if the ACRs of another officer were decidedly inferior to those of the respondent, the same, at best, may have relevance to the grant of extension to such officer without conferring any right or entitlement to the respondent for a similar extension - In the present case, though there were adverse remarks/comments dated 15. 12. 1995 against the respondent, but the same were not acted upon and moreover, the subsequent ACRs of respondent were sufficiently positive and depicted him as an efficient Judicial Officer with good reputation for honesty and impartiality - Also, promotion to the highest level in the District judiciary as well as selection grade in the said cadre was granted to the respondent - The said promotions had the effect of wiping out the adverse remark dated 15. 12. 1995 - The High Court, on the administrative side, therefore, was not justified in refusing to continue with the service of the respondent beyond the age of 58 years - However, a period of nearly 14 years has elapsed in the meantime and it will be highly inequitable to request the High Court to redo the exercise at this belated stage - Besides such a course of action will also be unnecessary - Respondent to be treated to have retired from service on completion of 60 years of age and all consequential benefits, including pay and pension on that basis, directed to be made available to him forthwith and without any delay.Service Law - Judicial Service - Potential for continued C useful service of Judicial Officer beyond the age of 58 years - Evaluation and assessment - Judicial Review - Scope - Held: Evaluation of service record of a judicial officer for the purpose of formation of an opinion as to his/her potential for continued useful service is required to be made by the High  Court which means the Full Court on the administrative side - The ultimate decision is always preceded by an elaborate consideration of the matter by Hon'ble Judges of the High Court who are familiar with the qualities and attributes of the judicial officer under consideration - The very process by  which the decision is eventually arrived at, should permit a limited judicial review - It is only in a rare case where the decision taken is unsupported by any material or the same reflects a conclusion which, on the face of it, cannot be sustained that judicial review would be permissible."
