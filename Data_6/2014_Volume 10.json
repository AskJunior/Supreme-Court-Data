        "HeadNote": " National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005: History of promulgation of NTT Act - Discussed. Whether High Courts which discharge judicial functions, can be substituted by an extra-judicial body such as NTT and whether the NTT in the manner of its constitution undermines a process of independence and fairness, which are sine qua non of an adjudicatory authority - Held: It was impermissible D for the legislature to abrogate/divest the core judicial appellate functions traditionally vested with the High Court, and to confer! vest the same, with an independent quasi-judicial authority, which did not even have the basic ingredients of a superior Court, like the High Court (whose jurisdiction is sought to be E transferred) - Jurisdiction vested in the High Courts u!Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, is not only in respect of the rightful implementation of statutory provisions, but also of supervisory jurisdiction, over courts and tribunals and cannot be curtailed under any circumstances. Whether while transferring jurisdiction to a newly created court/tribunal, it is essential to maintain the standards and the stature of the court replaced - Held: Parliament was not precluded from establishing a court under a new name, to exercise the jurisdiction that was being exercised by members G of the higher judiciary, at the time when the constitution came into force - But when that was done, it was critical to ensure, that the persons appointed to be members of such a court/ tribunal, should be appointed in the same manner, and ,should be entitled to the same security of tenure, as the holder of the judicial office, at the time when the constitution came into force - High Court. Whether the transfer of adjudicatory functions vested in the High Court to the NTT violates recognized constitutional B conventions - Held: Recognized constitutional conventions pertaining to the Westminster model, do not debar the legislating authority from enacting legislation to vest adjudicatory functions, earlier vested in a superior court, with an alternative court/tribunal - Exercise of such power by the C Parliament would per se not violate any constitutional convention. s.5 - Validity of- Clause that NTT would ordinarily have its sittings in the National Capital Territory of Delhi - Role of the Central Government in determining the sitting of benches D of the NTT - Held: It is not appropriate to allow the Central Government to play any role, with reference to the places where the benches would be set up, the areas over which the benches would exercise jurisdiction, the composition and the constitution of the benches, as also, the transfer of the E Members from one bench to another - Sub-sections (2), (3), (4) and (5) of s.5 are unconstitutional. s. 6 -- Validity of- Clause that a person would be qualified for appointment as a Member, if he is or has been a Member of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal or of the Customs, F Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal for at least 5 years - Held: Only a person possessing professional qualification in law, with substantial experience in the practice of law, will be in a position to handle the onerous responsibilities which a Chairperson and Members of the NTT will have to shoulder G - Accountant Members and Technical Members cannot said to have the stature and qualification possessed by judges of High Courts - s. 7 is declared unconstitutional. s. 7 - Validity of - Appointment of Chairperson and other Members by Central Governf'Ylent - Held: NTT has been H constituted as a replacement of High Courts - The manner of appointment of Chairperson/Members to the NTT will have to be by the same procedure (or by a similar procedure) to that which is prevalent for appointment of judges of High Courts - s. 7 cannot be considered to be constitutionally valid, since it involves participation of Secretaries of Departments of the Central Government in the process of selection and appointment of the Chairperson and Members of the NTT - s. 7 is declared as unconstitutional. s. 8 - Validity of - Appointment of Chairperson/Member to the NTT, in the first instance, for a duration of 5 years and reappointment, for a further period of 5 years - Held: A C provision for reappointment would itself have the effect of undermining the independence of the Chairperson/Members of the NTT - Every Chairperson/Member appointed to the NTT, would be constrained _to decide matters, in a manner that would ensure his reappointment in terms of s. 8 of the Act - o His decisions may or may not be based on his independent understanding - s. 8 is declared as unconstitutional. s.13(1)- Whether s.13(1) insofar as it allows Accountants to represent a party to an appeal before the NTT is valid - Held: A perusal of s.13 reveals, that a party to an appeal (other than the Revenue) may appear either in person, or may authorize one or more Chartered Accountants, or legal practitioners, or any person duly authorized by him, to present his case before the NTT - The Members of the NTT would most definitely be confronted with the legal issues emerging out of Family Law, Hindu Law, Mohammedan Law, Company Law, Law of Partnership, Law related to Territoriality, Law related to Trusts and Societies, Contract Law, Law relating to Transfer of Property, Law relating to Intellectual Property, Interpretation of Statutes, and other Miscellaneous Provisions of Law, from time to time - The NTT besides these statutes, will not only have to interpret the provisions of the three statutes, out of which appeals will be heard by it, but will also have to examine a challenge to the vires of statutory amendments made in the said provisions, from time to time - Chartered Accountants at best would be specialist in B understanding and explaining issues pertaining to accounts - Allowing them to appear on behalf of a pctrty before NTT would be unacceptable - s. 13 insofar it allows Chartered Accountant to represent a party to an appeal before the NTT is declared unconstitutional. s. 15 - Whether Company Secretaries should be allowed to appear before the NTT to represent a party to an appeal in the same fashion, and on parity with, Accountants - Held: Keeping in mind the fact, that in terms of s. 15, the NTT would C hear appeals from the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) only on \"substantial questions of /aw': it is difficult to appreciate the propriety of representation, on behalf of a party to an appeal, through either Chartered Accountants or D Company Secretaries, before the NTT - The determination at the hands of the NTT is shorn of factual disputes - It has to decide only \"substantial questions of law\" - The Company Secretaries cannot be allowed to represent a party to an appeal before the NTT - The claim of Company Secretaries, E to represent a party before the NTT is rejected. s. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 13 - Since these provisions of the NTT Act have been held to be illegal and unconstitutional, the remaining provisions have been rendered otiose and worthless, and as such, the provision$ of the NTT Act, as a whole, are set aside - Since the said provisions, constitute the edifice of the NTT Act, and without these provisions the remaining prov1s1ons are rendered ineffective and inconsequential, the entire enactment is declared unconstitutional. Constitution (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976 - Constitutional validity of, assailed on the ground that the same violates the basic structure of the Constitution of India, by impinging on the power of \"judicial review\" vested in the High Court- Discussed - Income Tax Act - Customs Act, 1962 - Central Excise Act, 1944. Constitution of India, 1950: Basic structure - Does the NTT Act violate the \"basic structure\" of the Constitution - Held: Jurisdiction transferred by the NTT Act was with regard to specified subjects under tax related statutes - That was permissible - However, the NTT Act has not transferred power vested in courts by the Constitution - The power of 'judicial review\" vested in the High Court u!Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution, has remained intact - Since the above jurisdiction of the High Court has not been ousted, the NTT will be deemed to be discharging a supplemental role, rather than a substitutional role - The Parliament has the power to enact legislation, and to vest adjudicatory functions, earlier vested in the High Court, with an alternative court/tribunal - Exercise of such power by the Parliament would not per se violate the \"basic structure\" of the Constitution - The \"basic structure\" of the Constitution will stand violated, if while enacting legislation pertaining to transfer of judicial power, Parliament does not ensure, that the newly created court/tribunal, conforms with the salient characteristics and standards, of the court sought to be substituted - National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005. Arts 129, 131, 132 to 134A, 136, 141, 145, 214, 215, 225, 226, 227, 368 - Powers of High Courts and Supreme Court - Scope of, discussed. Art.227 - Scope of - Held: The superintending power of the High Courts under Art. 227 is to keep courts and tribunals F within the bounds of the law - Hence, errors of law that are apparent on the face of the record are liable to be corrected - In correcting such errors, High Court has necessarily to state what the law is by deciding questions of law, which bind subordinate courts and tribunals in future cases - Code of G Civil Procedure, 1908 - s. 100 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.100 - Scope of- Held: The superior courts alone are vested with the power to, decide questions of law - Hitherto Parliament has entrusted a superior court of record with decisions on questions of law substantial questions of law - It is obvious, that substantial questions of law which relate to taxation would also involve many areas of civil and criminal law - It is, therefore, not correct to say that taxation, being a specialized subject, can be dealt with by a tribunal - All substantial questions of law have under our constitutional scheme to be decided by the superior courts and the superior courts alone.

CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, 1973: s.362 - Cancellation by High Courl of bail granted by it G earlier - Held: The order for bail in the bail application preferred by the accused-petitioners finally disposes of the issue in consideration and grants relief of bail to the applicants - Since, no express provision for review of order granting bail exists under the Code, High Court becomes functus officio and s.362 applies barring the review of judgment and order of the Court granting bail to the accused-petitioners - Even in the light of fact of misrepresentation by the accused- petitioners during the grant of bail, High Court could not have s entertained respondent/informant's prayer by sitting in review of its judgment by entertaining miscellaneous petition - judgment and order passed by High Court is set aside.

SENTENCE/SENTENCING: Murder - Accused person committing murders of 8 persons of their family - Death sentence by courts below - Held: The time, place and manner of the commission of crime are indicative of the motive of accused-appellants - They have ruthlessly and successively butchered their own kith and kin for obtaining possession of certain pass-book, money and immovable property without any provocation - Being armed with sharp edged weapons, the quick succession with which the accused-appellants proceeded to slaughter the eight members of their family classifies their act as pre-planned and reflects the cold-blooded fashion with which the callous design was executed - Their lack of remorse is reflected from the act of extending threat of life to other members of the family present in the house should they dare to inform the police - The mitigating circumstances enumerated, under which the appellants seek refuge, have failed to convince the Court - In the considered view of the Court, the \"rarest of the rare\" case exists when an accused would be a menace, threat and anti-thetical to harmony in the society - Especially in cases where an accused does ndt act on provocation, acting in spur of the moment but meticulously executes a deliberately planned crime inspite of understanding the probable consequence of his act, the death sentence may be the most appropriate punishment - Keeping in view the principle of proportionality of sentence or what it termed as \"just-desert\" for the vile act of slaughtering eight lives including four innocent minors and a physically infirm child whereby an entire family is exterminated, the depravity of appellant's offence would attract no lesser sentence than the death penalty.

Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - s.23 - Acquisition of land - Market Value - Determination of - Comparable sales method for valuation of land - Held: Comparable sales method of valuation is preferred rather than methods of valuation of land such as capitalization of net income method or experl opinion method, because it furnishes the evidence for determination of the market value of the acquired land at which the willing purchaser would pay for the acquired land if it had been sold in the open market at the time of issuance of notification u/s. 4. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - s.23 - Determination of  Market Value on the basis of average price paid under sale transactions - Scope - Legal position - Discussed - Held: Where the lands acquired are of different type and different locations, averaging is not permissible - But where there are several sales of similar lands, more or less, at the same time,  whose prices have marginal variation, averaging thereof is permissible - For fixation of fair and reasonable market value of any type of land, abnormally high value or abnormally low value sales should be carefully discarded - If the number ofale deeds of the same locality and the same period with short intervals are available, average price of the available number of sale deeds shall be considered as a fair and reasonable market price - Ultimately, it is in the interest of justice for the land losers to be awarded fair compensation - B All attempts should be taken to award fair compensation to the extent possible on the basis of their accessibility to different kinds of roads, locational advantages etc. - On facts, the four perpetual lease deeds A-7 to A-10 relied upon by the appellants were of the same locality and related to the period c just prior to s.4(1) notification - High Court justified in taking average of the said four exemplars and approach adopted by the High Court in averaging the sale prices of Exs A 7 to A 10 cannot be said to be perverse. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - s. 23 - Determination of D Market Value - Gap between \"leasehold\" price and \"freehold\" price - To be taken into consideration -Held: 'Freehold land' and 'leasehold land' are conceptually different - If a property subject to a lease and in possession of a lessee is offered for sale by the owner to a prospective private purchaser, the E purchaser being aware that on purchase he will get only title and not possession and that the sale in his favour will be subject to encumbrance namely, the lease, he will offer a price taking note of th'e encumbrances - Naturally, such a price would be Jess than the price of a property without any F encumbrance - But wtien a land is acquired free from encumbrances, the market value of the same will certainly be higher - On facts, Exs A 7 to A 10 were the perpetual lease deeds relating to the period from September 1995 to December 1996 and to get the perpetual lease deeds G converted as freehold, the holder of perpetual leasehold had to pay further amount to DOA - Having regard to the pen\"od of Exs A 7 to A 10 and the date of issuance of s.4 notification dated 19.2.1997, addition of 20 Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - s. 23 - Determination of Market Value - Auction sales of commercial I residential plots - If a true index - Deduction towards competitive bidding - Held: The general rule that the sale prices of the comparable sales should be relied upon for calculating the market value will not apply when the sale transactions relied upon are auction sales - On facts, 20% deduction made for competitive bidding and value of acquired land fixed accordingly. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - s. 23 - Determination of Market Value - Deductions made for development - Essential components of - Held: Deduction towards development depends upon the nature and location of the acquired land - The deduction includes components of land required to be set apart under the building rules for roads, sewage, electricity, parks and other common facilities and also deduction towards development charges like laying of roads, construction of sewerage - Rule of one third deduction towards development appears to be the general rule - But so far as Delhi Development Authority is concerned, or similar statutory authorities, where well planned layouts are put in place, larger land area may be utilized for forming layout, roads, parks and other common amenities - In the instant case, having regard to the extent of the land acquired and the development in and around Vasant Kunj area, it is appropriate to make 35% deduction towards utilization of the land area in the layout for roads, drains, parks, playgrounds and civic amenities - So far as the expenditure for development of the large extent of land into a developed area by construction of proper roads, underground drainage, sewerage and erection of electricity lines, it is appropriate to make further deduction of 25% towards development charges. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - ss. 28 and 34 - Award of compensation - Payment of interest - Held: Normally, Court awards interest if it enhances compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collector, unless there are exceptional circumstances - Award of interest uls.34 is mandatory inasmuch the word used in the Section is 'shall' - Interest payable u/s.34 is statutory- Claim for interest u/s.28 proceeds on the basis that due compensation not having B been paid, the claimant should be allowed interest on the enhanced compensation amount - Award of interest uls.28 is discretionary power vested in the Court and it has to be exercised in a judicious manner and not arbitrarily - Use of the word \"may\" in s.28 does not confer any arbitrary discretion c on the Court to disallow interest for no valid or proper reasons - Both in terms of s.34 and s.28, interest at 9% per annum is payable for the first year of taking possession and 15% per annum thereafter, if the amount of compensation was not paid or deposited within a period of one year or deposited D thereafter. Land Acquisition Act, 1894 - s.27 - Award of compensation - Payment of proportionate costs - Held: The language of s.27(1) is clear and very wide and it gives power to the courts to order costs to be paid by what persons and in what proportions they are to be paid - In making order for costs uls.27(1), the court may have regard to the provisions of s.35 CPC -Ordinarily, when a litigant succeeds in part and fails in part, the equitable order made is that he should receive proportionate costs.

Rule 2 - Overriding effect - Held: Rule 2 of the 2004 Rules leaves no room for any doubt that the 2004 Rules have an overriding effect, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contf!ined, in any other Service Rules promulgated under Art. 309 _of the Constitution of India - All the other Rules brought to the notice of the Court had been notified prior to the Notification of the 2004 Rules (notified on 15.06.2014) - Thus viewed, the 2004 Rules have an overriding effect on other Rules. Rules 1 (3) and 4 - Promotion from Group 'D' post to Group 'C' post - Criterion - 'Seniority to the rejection of unfit' - Government Orders dated 17. 7. 2004 and 8. 11. 2004 set G aside by High Court holding the same as violative of Rule 4 - Held: Inter se merit is inconsequential for promotions under Rule 4 of the 2004 Rules, insofar as promotions from Group 'D' service to the lowest ranks of ministerial posts in Group 'C' service, are concerned - Rule 4 postulates seniority as the basis for promotion, but it also provides that promotions would be made subject to the \"rejection of unfit\" - If the G. Os. dated 17. 7. 2004 and 8. 11. 2004 were the basis of determining the fitness of employees concerned, for onward promotion and for adopting measures for 'rejection of the unfit' then the two G.
