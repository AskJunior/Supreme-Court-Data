\u2013 Petition filed underthe Code for financial debts owed to the financial creditors-Banksby the corporate debtor ESIL for Rs.45,000 crores \u2013 RP (ResolutionProfessional) invited an expression of interest from potentialresolution applicants \u2013 Appellant (AMIPL) and one entity Numetalsubmitted expression of interest \u2013 Submission of resolution plan byAMIPL and Numetal \u2013 RP found both AMIPL and Numetal ineligibleunder s.29A \u2013 RP held that AM Netherlands mentioned as aconnected person of AMIPL was disclosed as a promoter of UttamGalva which was declared as a NPA \u2013 Similar was the situation ofNumetal \u2013 AMIPL and Numetal challenged the order of RP beforeAdjudicating Authority (NCLT) \u2013 On 2.4.2018, pursuant to the RP\u2019sinvitation, fresh resolution plans submitted by AMIPL, Numetal andone other entity \u2018Vedanta\u2019 \u2013 On 19.4.2018, NCLT passed order inall the IAs, wherein it first held that there was no patent illegality inthe decision of RP for declaring ineligibility of applicants \u2013 It thenwent on to hold that RP ought to have produced both the resolutionplans before the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and to follow theprovision of s.29A(c) r/w s.30(4) for affording opportunity to theresolution applicants before declaring them ineligible and, therefore,remanded back the matter to RP and CoC on this ground \u2013 Pendingappeals before NCLAT, on 8.5.2018, CoC disqualified AMIPL andNumetal \u2013 On 7.9.2018, NCLAT held that at the time of first resolutionplan by Numetal, one of the shareholders being \u2018AEL\u2019 was relatedparty and therefore, Numetal was not eligible to submit resolutionplan in terms of s.29A and that on 29.3.2018, as the AEL was notthe shareholder of Numetal and all the three shareholders beingeligible, Numetal was eligible \u2013 Therefore, resolution plan submitted by Numetal to be considered by CoC to find out its viability \u2013 Asregards AMIPL, order of NCLT was affirmed subject to conditionthat AMIPL shall make payment of all overdue amount with interestthereon and charges relating to NPA of both the \u201cUttam Galva\u201dand \u201cKSS Petron\u201d within three days \u2013 Instant appeals filed by AMIPLand Numetal \u2013 Held: The ingredients of sub-clause (c) of s.29A arethat, the ineligibility to submit a resolution plan attaches if anyperson, as is referred to in the opening lines of s.29A, either itselfhas an account, or is a promoter of, or in the management or controlof, a corporate debtor which has an account, which account hasbeen classified as a non-performing asset, for a period of at leastone year from the date of such classification till the date ofcommencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process \u2013 Ifit is shown, on facts, that, at a reasonably proximate point of timebefore the submission of the resolution plan, the affairs of thepersons referred to in s.29A are so arranged, as to avoid payingoff the debts of the non-performing asset concerned, such personsmust be held to be ineligible to submit a resolution plan \u2013 In theinstant case, since both the resolution plans even on 2.4.2018,were hit by s.29A(c), and since the proviso to s.29A(c) will not applyas the corporate debtors related to AMIPL and Numetal have notpaid off their respective NPAs, ordinarily, these appeals would bedisposed of by merely declaring both resolution applicants to beineligible under s.29A(c) \u2013 However, in order to do complete justiceunder Art.142 of the Constitution of India, one more opportunity isgiven to both resolution applicants to pay off the NPAs of theirrelated corporate debtors within a period of two weeks inaccordance with the proviso to s.29A(c) \u2013 If such payments aremade within the said period, both resolution applicants can resubmittheir resolution plans dated 2.4.2018 to CoC, who are then given aperiod of 8 weeks to accept, by the requisite majority, the bestamongst the plans submitted, including the resolution plan submittedby Vedanta \u2013 In the event that no plan is found worthy of acceptanceby the requisite majority of the CoC, the corporate debtor, i.e. ESIL,shall go into liquidation \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.142 \u2013 Companylaw.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.29A(c) \u2013 It isimportant for the competent authority to see that persons, who are otherwise ineligible and hit by sub-clause (c), do not wriggle out ofthe proviso to sub-clause (c) by other means, so as to avoid theconsequences of the proviso \u2013 For this purpose, despite the factthat the relevant time for the ineligibility under sub-clause (c) toattach is the time of submission of the resolution plan, antecedentfacts reasonably proximate to this point of time can always be seen,to determine whether the persons referred to in s.29A are, insubstance, seeking to avoid the consequences of the proviso to subclause(c) before submitting a resolution plan.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.29A \u2013 Point of timeat which the disqualification in sub-clause (c) of s.29A will attach \u2013Held: The stage of ineligibility attaches when the resolution plan issubmitted by a resolution applicant \u2013 The date of commencement ofthe corporate insolvency resolution process is only relevant for thepurpose of calculating whether one year has lapsed from the dateof classification of a person as a non-performing asset.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.3(37) \u2013 By s.3(37)of the Code, words and expressions used but not defined in theCode but defined inter alia by the SEBI Act, 1992, and the CompaniesAct, 2013, shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them inthose Acts \u2013 SEBI (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and

entity of the group as a whole.Words and phrases: Expression \u201cacting jointly\u201d \u2013 Meaningof in the context of s.29A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016."

Sikri, J.: The Constitution is silenton the role of the \u2018Chief Justice\u2019 \u2013 However, the Constitution Benchin the case of Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reformshad held that Chief Justice alone has the administrative control ofthe Supreme Court and he is the Master of the Roster and he alonehas the prerogative to constitute the Benches of the Court andallocate cases to the Benches so constituted \u2013 Legal positioncontained in the various judgments of the Supreme Court is basedupon healthy practice and sound conventions which have developedover a period of time and that stands engrafted in the SupremeCourt Rules \u2013 The two most obvious functions of the \u2018Chief Justice\u2019are to exercise judicial power as a Judge of the Court on equalfooting as others, being \u2018among equals\u2019 and to assume responsibilityof the administration of the Court, which gives him the ultimateauthority for determining the distribution of judicial work load \u2013Per Ashok Bhushan, J. (concurring): Sub-article (1) of Art.145provides that subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament,the Supreme Court may from time to time, with the approval of thePresident, make rules for regulating generally the practice andprocedure of the Court, including the various subjects as enumeratedin sub-article (1) \u2013 The power of the Chief Justice to allocate casesflows from the rules framed u/Art.145 \u2013 The Chief Justice of Indiahas been exercising the jurisdiction of formulating the roster forconvenient distribution of Court\u2019s business and constituting thebenches from time to time \u2013 Furthermore, it is also clear from thelaw laid down by the Supreme Court in various Judgments thatallocation of business of Court by the Chief Justice not only flows from the Constitutional provisions but it is the prerogative of theChief Justice and which is a convention followed from the verybeginning \u2013 Supreme Court Rules, 2013 \u2013 Practice and Procedure.Supreme Court Rules, 2013 \u2013 Whether the expression \u2018ChiefJustice\u2019 in the Supreme Court Rules is to be read as \u2018Collegium\u2019 offirst five Judges \u2013 Held: Per A.K. Sikri, J.: In case the expression\u2018Chief Justice\u2019 is to be interpreted as \u2018Collegium\u2019, it would be difficultto have smooth day to day functioning of the Supreme Court \u2013Assigning of cases is undertaken by the Chief Justice on daily basisin contrast with the meetings of the Collegium for the purpose ofappointment of Judges, which is infrequent \u2013 Thus, meeting ofCollegium for the purpose of assigning the cases to a particularBench on daily basis is impracticable \u2013 Per Ashok Bhushan, J.(concurring): Art.145 empowers the Supreme Court to frame ruleswith the approval of the President and the Rules framed by SupremeCourt u/Art.145 specifically refers the Chief Justice in Chapter VI,the Chief Justice, who is to nominate the bench for hearing everycase, appeal or matter \u2013 There is no indication in any of theConstitutional provisions or rules framed thereunder that allocationof cases and formation of benches, Chief Justice should be read ascollegium \u2013 Practice and Procedure"
