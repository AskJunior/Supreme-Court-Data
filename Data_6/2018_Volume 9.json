Custom or usage ofprohibiting women between the ages of 10 to 50 years from enteringthe Sabarimala temple is violative of Art. 25(1), and violative of the 1965 Act \u2013 r. 3(b) whereby women by custom and usage are notallowed to enter a place of public worship, is unconstitutional beingviolative of Art. 25(1) and Art. 15(1) \u2013 Practice or usage of keepingout women is violative of s. 3 and is struck down \u2013 Since proviso tothe Section is not attracted on the facts of the case, and since thesaid Act is clearly a measure enacted u/Art. 25(2)(b), any religiousright claimed on the basis of custom and usage as an essential matterof religious practice u/Art. 25(1), will be subject to the law made u/Art. 25(2)(b) \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) Notifications issuedby the Devaswom Board, prohibiting the entry of women betweenthe ages of ten and fifty, are ultra vires s. 3 of the 1965 Act and areeven otherwise unconstitutional \u2013 Hindu women constitute a \u2018sectionor class\u2019 of Hindus u/s. 2 \u2013 Rule 3(b) of enforces a custom contraryto s. 3, which directly offends the right of temple entry establishedby s. 3, thus, is ultra vires the 1965 Act \u2013 Claim for the exclusion ofwomen from religious worship, even if it be founded in religioustext, is subordinate to the constitutional values of liberty, dignityand equality \u2013 Exclusionary practices are contrary to constitutionalmorality \u2013 Practice of excluding women from the temple atSabarimala is not an essential religious practice \u2013 Social exclusionof women, based on menstrual status, is a form of untouchabilitywhich is an anathema to constitutional values \u2013 Held: (Per InduMalhotra J.: Dissenting) Denial of entry of women in the age groupof 10 to 50 years in Sabarimala temple is not violative of Art. 14 \u2013Sabarimala temple constitutes a religious denomination \u2013 Practiseof restricting entry of women between the age group of 10 to 50years is an essential religious practise of the devotees of LordAyyappa at Sabarimala Temple \u2013 r.3(b) is a statutory recognition ofa pre-existing custom and usage being followed by this Temple \u2013 r.3(b) is within the ambit of the proviso to s. 3.Art. 26 \u2013 Religious denomination \u2013 Determination of \u2013Devotees of Lord Ayyappa, if constitute a religious denomination \u2013Held: (Per Dipak Misra, CJI) Devotees of Lord Ayyappa do nothave an identified group or sect \u2013 They do not have commonreligious tenets peculiar to themselves, which they regard asconducive to their spiritual well\u2013being, other than those which arecommon to the Hindu religion \u2013 Thus, the devotees of Lord Ayyappaare exclusively Hindus and do not constitute a separate religious denomination \u2013 Held: (Per Nariman, J.) There is no distinctive namegiven to the worshippers of Sabrimala temple; there is no commonfaith in the sense of a belief common to a particular religion orsection thereof; or common organization of the worshippers of theSabarimala temple so as to constitute the said temple into a religiousdenomination \u2013 Also, there are over a thousand other Ayyappatemples in which the deity is worshipped by practicing Hindus ofall kinds \u2013 Thus, Article 26 not attracted \u2013 (Per Chandrachud, J.)Worship of the presiding deity is not confined to adherents of aparticular religion \u2013 Practices associated with the forms of worshipdo not constitute the devotees into a religious denomination \u2013Considering the inability of the collective of individuals to satisfythe judicially-enunciated requirements, the set of individuals whorefer to themselves as \u201cAyyappans\u201d or devotees of Lord Ayyappaas a \u2018religious denomination\u2019 cannot be recognized \u2013 Held: (PerIndu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) If there are clear attributes that thereexists a sect, which is identifiable as being distinct by its beliefs andpractices, and having a collection of followers who follow the samefaith, it would be identifiable as a religious denomination \u2013 Onfacts, respondents have made out a strong and plausible case thatthe worshippers of the Sabarimala Temple have the attributes of areligious denomination, or sect thereof.Arts. 25 and 26 \u2013 Essential Religious Practices under Art. 25\u2013 Determination of \u2013 Practice of exclusion of women of the agegroup of 10 to 50 years being followed at the Sabarimala Temple \u2013Held: (Per Dipak Misra, CJI) There seems to be no continuity inthe exclusionary practice followed at the Sabarimala temple andthus, it cannot be treated as an essential practice \u2013 On the contrary,it is an essential part of the Hindu religion to allow Hindu women toenter into a temple as devotees and followers of Hindu religion andoffer their prayers to the deity \u2013 Moreso, in the absence of anyscriptural or textual evidence, the exclusionary practice followedat the Sabarimala temple, cannot be accorded the status of anessential practice of Hindu religion \u2013 By allowing women to enterinto the Sabarimala temple for offering prayers, it cannot beimagined that the nature of Hindu religion would be fundamentallyaltered or changed in any manner \u2013 Held: (Per Nariman, J.) Onlythe essential part of religion, as distinguished from secular activities, is the subject matter of the fundamental right \u2013 Matters essential toreligious faith and/or belief are to be judged on evidence before acourt of law by what the community professing the religion itselfhas to say as to the essentiality of such belief \u2013 One test would be toremove the particular belief stated to be an essential belief from thereligion, would the religion remain the same or would it be altered \u2013In case religious activities are mixed up with secular activities, thedominant nature of activity test is to be applied \u2013 Court to take acommon sense view and be actuated by considerations of practicalnecessity \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) In determining theessentiality of a practice, it is to be considered whether the practiceis prescribed to be of an obligatory nature \u2013 If a practice is optional,it cannot be said to be \u2018essential\u2019 to a religion \u2013 If there is afundamental change in the character of the religion, only then cansuch a practice be claimed to be an \u2018essential\u2019 part of that religion\u2013 Texts and tenets do not indicate that the practice of excludingwomen is an essential part of the religion \u2013 Practice of excludingwomen is not uniform and militates against a claim that such practiceis obligatory \u2013 Hence, no fundamental change in character ofreligion \u2013 Essential religious practices test enables the Court toadopt a reformist vision of religion even though it may conflict withthe views held by the religion \u2013 Competence of the Court to do soand the legitimacy of the assumption of that role may be questionable\u2013 Test merits a closer look in future \u2013 Held: (Per Indu Malhotra J.:Dissenting) \u2018Essential practises test\u2019 have to be determined by thetenets of the religion itself \u2013 Practises followed since time immemorial,which may have been scripted in the religious texts of this temple,are to be regarded as \u201cessential\u201d, and afforded protection u/Art.25 \u2013 Thus, the practise of restricting entry of women between theage group of 10 to 50 years is an essential religious practise of thedevotees of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala Temple.Art. 25(1) \u2013 Expression \u2018all persons under\u2019 \u2013 Meaning of \u2013Held:(Per Dipak Misra, CJI) Expression \u2018all persons\u2019, demonstratesthat the freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practiseand propagate religion is available, though subject to the restrictionsdelineated in Art. 25(1) itself, to every person including women \u2013Rights guaranteed u/Art. 25(1) has nothing to do with gender \u2013Held: (Per Nariman, J.) Art. 25 recognises a fundamental right infavour of \u201call persons\u201d which has reference to natural persons Every member of a religious community has a right to practice thereligion so long as he does not, in any way, interfere with thecorresponding right of his co-religionists to do the same.Art. 25(1) \u2013 Expression \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.] \u2018allpersons under\u2019 \u2013 By all persons, the Constitution means that everyindividual in society without distinction of any kind is entitled to afreedom of conscience and to freely profess, protect and propogatereligion \u2013 Three defining features of clause (1) of Article 25 are,first, the entitlement of all persons without exception; second, therecognition of an equal entitlement; and third, the recognition bothof the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practiceand propogate religion.Art. 17 \u2013 Untouchability\u2013 Denial of entry to women in theage group of 10 to 50 in the Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala, if amanifestation of \u201cuntouchability\u201d and thus, violative of Art. 17 \u2013Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) Art. 17 prohibits the practice of\u201cuntouchability\u201d, which is based on notions of purity and impurity,\u201cin any form\u201d \u2013 Notions of \u201cpurity and pollution\u201d, which stigmatizeindividuals, can have no place in a constitutional regime - Prejudiceagainst women based on notions of impurity and pollutionassociated with menstruation is a symbol of social exclusion \u2013 It isa form of untouchability which is an anathema to constitutionalvalues \u2013 Held: (Per Indu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) Limitedrestriction on the entry of women during the notified age-groupdoes not fall within the purview of Art. 17 \u2013 Art. 17 refers to practiceof untouchability as committed in the Hindu community againstHarijans or people from depressed classes, and not women \u2013Restriction on women within a certain age-band, is based upon thehistorical origin and beliefs and practices of the sabrimala temple,on the unique characteristic of the deity, and not founded on anysocial exclusion \u2013 Women of the notified age group are allowedentry into all other temples of Lord Ayyappa.Art. 25(1) \u2013 Term \u2018morality\u2019 in Art. 25(1) \u2013 Held: (Per DipakMisra, CJI) Cannot be viewed with a narrow lens so as to confinethe sphere of definition of morality to what an individual, a sectionor religious sect may perceive the term to mean \u2013 Since theConstitution has been adopted and given by the people of thiscountry to themselves, the term public morality in Art. 25 has to beappositely understood as being synonymous with constitutional morality \u2013 Notions of public order, morality and health cannot beused as colourable device to restrict the freedom to freely practisereligion and discriminate against women of the age group of 10 to50 years by denying them their legal right to enter and offer theirprayers at the Sabarimala Temple.Art. 25(1) \u2013 Term \u2018morality\u2019 \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.)Popular notions about what is or is not moral may in fact be deeplyoffensive to individual dignity and human rights \u2013 Individual dignitycannot be allowed to be subordinate to the morality of the mob andshould not vary in accordance with the popular fashions of the day\u2013 Overarching sense of constitutional morality with the quest forhuman dignity, liberty and equality must prevail.Arts. 25(2)(b) and 26(b) \u2013 Right to manage its own affairs inmatters of religion under Art. 26 \u2013 Held: (Per Nariman, J.) Rightgranted u/Art. 26 to be harmoniously construed with Art. 25(2)(b)\u2013 Right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion granted byArt. 26(b), to be subject to laws made u/Art. 25(2)(b) which throwopen religious institutions of a public character to all classes andsections of Hindus \u2013 Thus, even though the entry of persons into aHindu temple of a public character would pertain to managementof its own affairs in matters of religion, yet such temple entry wouldbe subject to a law throwing open a Hindu religious institution of apublic character owned and managed by a religious denominationor section thereof to all classes or sections of Hindus \u2013 However,religious practices by the religious denomination or section thereof,which do not have the effect of either a complete ban on templeentry of certain persons, or are otherwise not discriminatory, maypass muster u/Art. 26(b).Art. 25(2)(b) and 26(b) \u2013 Right to manage its own affairs inmatters of religion u/Art. 26 \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) Absenceof a clause of subjection in Article 26 does not lead to the conclusionthat the freedom of a religious denomination exists as a discreteelement, divorced from the others freedoms \u2013 Article 26 is one amonga large cluster of freedoms which the Constitution has envisaged asintrinsic to human liberty and dignity \u2013 Freedom of religiousdenominations under Article 26 must be read in a manner whichpreserves equally, other individual freedoms \u2013 Dignity of womenwhich an emanation of Article 15 and a reflection of Article 21 cannot be disassociated from the exercise of religious freedom underArticle 26.Art. 32 \u2013 Writ petition under \u2013 Issue that women who happento be between the ages of 10 and 50, not allowed entry into thetemple at Sabarimala \u2013 Plea raised that that the Court should notdecide this case without any evidence being led on both sides \u2013Held: (Per Nariman, J.) Evidence is very much there, in the form ofthe writ petition and the affidavits filed in the writ petition by thepetitioners as well as by the Board, and by the Thanthri \u2013 Writ petitionfiled is itself not merely a pleading, but also evidence in the form ofaffidavits that are sworn.Arts. 25 and 26 \u2013 Engagement of essential religious practiceswith constitutional values \u2013 Exclusion of women between the agegroup ten and fifty from the Sabarimala temple \u2013 Held: (PerChandrachud, J.) Exclusion is destructive of dignity \u2013 To exclude awoman from the might of worship is fundamentally at odds withconstitutional values \u2013 Physiological features of a woman have nosignificance to her equal entitlements under the Constitution \u2013Menstrual status of a woman cannot be a valid constitutional basisto deny her the dignity of being and the autonomy of personhood \u2013Menstrual status of a woman is deeply personal and an intrinsicpart of her privacy \u2013 Constitution must treat it as a feature on thebasis of which no exclusion can be practised and no denial can beperpetrated.Art. 13 \u2013 Term \u2018laws in force\u2019 \u2013 Custom or usage if falls withinthe ambit of \u2018laws in force\u2019 u/Art.13(1) \u2013 Plea that the exclusion ofwomen from the Sabarimala temple constitutes a custom, independentof the Act and the 1965 Rules \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) Carvingout \u2018custom or usage\u2019 from constitutional scrutiny, denies theconstitutional vision of ensuring the primacy of individual dignity\u2013 Decision in Narasu case that custom or usage not included in theambit of laws in force, is based on flawed premises \u2013 Custom orusage cannot be excluded from \u2018laws in force\u2019\u2013 Decision in Narasucase, in immunizing uncodified personal law and construing thesame as distinct from custom, overlooked the wide ambit that was tobe attributed to the term \u2018laws in force\u2019.Arts. 25 and 26 \u2013 Deity as a bearer of constitutional rights \u2013Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) Word \u2018persons\u2019 in certain statutes have been interpreted to include idols \u2013 Merely because a deity has beengranted limited rights as juristic persons under statutory law doesnot mean that the deity necessarily has constitutional rights \u2013 Deitymay be a juristic person for the purposes of religious law andcapable of asserting property rights \u2013 However, deity is not a\u2018person\u2019 for the purpose of Part III.Arts. 32, 25 and 14 \u2013 PIL filed challenging the practise ofrestricting the entry of women in the age group of 10 to 50 years inthe Sabarimala Temple \u2013 Maintainability and justiciability of \u2013 Held:(Per Indu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) Right to move the SupremeCourt u/Art. 32 for violation of fundamental rights, must be basedon a pleading that the petitioners\u2019 personal rights to worship in thisTemple have been violated \u2013 This is an essential requirement tomaintain the challenge \u2013 Courts normally do not delve into issuesof religious practises, especially in the absence of an aggrievedperson from that particular religious faith, or sect \u2013 In matters ofreligion and religious practises, Art. 14 can be invoked only bypersons who are similarly situated, that is, persons belonging to thesame faith, creed, or sect \u2013 Petitioners\u2013association/Intervenors donot claim to be devotees of Lord Ayyappa in the Sabarimala Temple,who are aggrieved by the practises followed in the SabarimalaTemple.Art. 14 \u2013 Matters of religion and religious practice \u2013Applicability of Art. 14 \u2013 Denial of entry to women in age group of10 to 50 years in Sabrimala temple \u2013 Held: (Per Indu Malhotra J.:Dissenting) Is not violative of Art. 14 \u2013 Religious customs andpractises cannot be solely tested on the touchstone of Article 14and the principles of rationality embedded therein \u2013 Religiouscommunity is to decide as to what constitutes essential religiouspractice \u2013 Equality in matters of religion to be viewed in the contextof the worshippers of the same faith \u2013 It is not for the courts todetermine which of these practises of a faith are to be struck down,except if they are pernicious, oppressive, or a social evil \u2013 Right togender equality to offer worship to Lord Ayyappa is protected bypermitting women of all ages, to visit temples where he has notmanifested himself in the form of a \u2018Naishtik Brahamachari\u2019, andthere is no similar restriction in those temples.Art. 15 \u2013 Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion race, caste or sex \u2013 Applicability of Art. 15 \u2013 Submission thatSabrimala temple would be included in phrase \u2018places of publicresort \u2013 Held: (Per Indu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) Cannot beaccepted \u2013 Conscious decision by the Constituent Assembly not toinclude \u2018places of worship\u2019 or \u2018temples\u2019 within the ambit of draftArticle 9, to be given due consideration.Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation ofEntry) Rules, 1965:r.3(b) \u2013 Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisationof Entry) Act 1965 \u2013 s. 3 \u2013 r. 3(b) whereby women by custom andusage not allowed to enter a place of public worship \u2013 r. 3(b) ifultra vires s. 3 of the 1965 Act, whereby places of worship to beopen to all section and classes of Hindus \u2013 Held: (Per Dipak Misra,CJI) r. 3(b) is ultra vires the 1965 Act \u2013 Rule 3(b) is also ultra viress. 4 of the 1965 Act \u2013 Held: (Per Nariman, J.) Rule 3(b) is ultravires of s. 3 of the 1965 Act, and is hit by Art. 25(1) and by Art.15(1)as this Rule discriminates against women on the basis of their sexonly \u2013 Held: (Per Chandrachud, J.) Term \u2018includes\u2019 in s.2(c) has tobe given a broad interpretation \u2013 The expression \u2018section or class\u2019includes women \u2013 Proviso to s.3 creates an exception \u2013 Lord Ayyappado not constitute a religious denomination and the Sabrimala templeis not a denominational temple \u2013 Hence, notifications issued by theBoard prohibiting the entry of woman between ages ten andfifty-five, are ultra vires s.3 \u2013 Rule 3(b) gives precedence to customsand usages which allow the exclusion of women \u201cat such time duringwhich they are not allowed to enter a place of public worship\u201d \u2013 Inlaying down such a prescription, Rule 3(b) directly offends the rightof temple entry established by Section 3, thus, r. 3(b) is ultra viresthe Act \u2013 Held: (Per Indu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) r. 3(b) is notultra vires s. 3 of the 1965 Act, since the proviso carves out anexception in the case of public worship in a temple for the benefitof any religious denomination or sect thereof, to manage theiraffairs in matters of religion \u2013 Declaration that places of publicworship shall be open to Hindus of all sections and classes is notabsolute, but subject to the right of a religious denomination to\u201cmanage its own affairs in matters of religion\u201d \u2013 r.3(b) is a statutoryrecognition of a pre-existing custom and usage being followed bythis Temple \u2013 r. 3(b) is within the ambit of the proviso to s. 3. r. 3(b) whereby women not allowed to enter a place of worship\u2013 Challenged to, as being violative of constitutional morality \u2013 Held:(Per Indu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) Constitutional Morality in apluralistic society and secular polity would reflect that the followersof various sects have the freedom to practise their faith inaccordance with the tenets of their religion \u2013 Equality and nondiscriminationare facet of Constitutional Morality, which cannotbe viewed in isolation \u2013 Balance is to be struck between theprinciples of equality and non-discrimination on the one hand, andthe protection of the cherished liberties of faith, belief, and worshipguaranteed by Arts 25 and 26 to persons belonging to all religionsin a secular polity, on the other hand \u2013 Constitutional moralityrequires the harmonisation or balancing of all such rights, to ensurethat the religious beliefs of none are obliterated or undermined \u2013 Itis the Constitutional duty of the Court to harmonise these rights.Judicial Review: Matters concerning religion and religiouspractice under the secular constitutional set up \u2013 Role of courts \u2013Held: (Per Indu Malhotra J.: Dissenting) Is to afford protection u/Art. 25(1) to those practises which are regarded as \u201cessential\u201d or\u201cintegral\u201d by the devotees, or the religious community itself \u2013 Art.25(2)(b) permits the State to redress social inequalities and injusticesby framing legislation \u2013Art. 25(2) permits State made law on thegrounds specified therein, and not judicial intervention \u2013 On facts,practice of exclusion of women of the age group of 10 to 50 yearsbeing followed at the Sabrimala temple are considered to be essentialor integral to that Temple \u2013 Any interference with the same wouldconflict with their right guaranteed by Art. 25(1) to worship LordAyyappa in the form of a \u2018Naishtik Brahmachari\u2019 \u2013 Judicial reviewof religious practises ought not to be undertaken, as the Courtcannot impose its morality or rationality with respect to the form ofworship of a deity \u2013 Doing so would negate the freedom to practiseone\u2019s religion according to one\u2019s faith and beliefs \u2013 It would amountto rationalising religion, faith and beliefs, which is outside the kenof the courts."
