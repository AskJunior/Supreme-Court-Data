Conviction of D appellant- Justification - Held: Justified - There was no delay in reporting the matter to the police - Merely because PW-1 was father of the deceased, his evidence could not be doubted on that count in absence of any suspicion - PW-9, produced to prove the recovery memo, was not a chance witness - His E presence being most natural and probable, his evidence was creditworthy and acceptable - Defence plea that the polythene bag in which the sickle was wrapped and taken by the 10 was without any seal at the time of recovery, untenable on the face of recovery memo itself - Since nobody was . F named in the FIR, the 10 took help of dog squad and the appellant was tracked - Appellant who was then taken into custody gave. statement regarding commission of crime - A{ his instance, \u00b7the sickle as well as blood stained clothes were . recovered. - Plea that the alleged recovery of clothes i.e. G gamchha 'and baniyan did not satisfy the mandate of s.27 of the Evidence Act, not sustainable - Further, the Doctor gave statement tha(the injury caused upon the victim could have been caused by the sickle so recovered - The incident clearly reflected upon the motive of the appellant - Earlier episode of eve teasing of the girl indicates that the appellant wanted sex with her and made forcible attempt to rape her and when the girl resisted, it enraged and provoked him to eventually commit the heinous act of murder - No evidence to suggest that PW1 had any enmity or grudge with anyone who may be suspected to have committed the murder - All the circumstances proved that it was nobody else but the appellant who attempted to commit rape and murdered the daughter of PW1 :..

        "HeadNote": " EMPLOYEES' STATE INSURANCE ACT, 1948: c s. 1 (5) - 'Establishment' - 'shop' - Turf Club - Held: A 'shop' is a business establishment where a systematic or organised commercial activity takes place with regard to the sale or purchase of goods or services, and includes an establishment that facilitates these transactions as well - An D establishment being a place of business and a shop being a business establishment, it can be said that a 'shop' is indeed covered under, and may be called a sub-set of the term 'establishment' -- The activities of appellant-Turf Clubs are in the nature of organised and systematic transactions -- E Appellants-Turf Clubs, in essence, take money from viewers, members as well as the general public, as admission fee and in return provide them with certain services, those being the actual viewing of the race and facilitating placing of bets -- Thus, a race-club, of the nature of appellants, would fall under F the scope of the term 'shop' and thereby the provisions of ES/ Act would extend upon them by virtue of the respective impugned notifications issued under sub-s. (5) of s. 1 - Therefore, it is held (i) a 'race-club' is an 'establishment' as rightly held in the case of Employees State Insurance Corporation v. Hyderabad Race Club; and (ii) Appellant-Turf G Clubs are duly covered under the term 'shop' for the purposes of ES/ Act and notifications issued thereunder -- Government of Tamil Nadu Notification No. l/(2)/LE/1859176 dated 3.04.1976 - Government of Maharashtra Notification No. ES/. 167713910/PH-15 dated 18.09.1978. s. 1 - 'Entertainment' - Horse racing - Held: Is a form of \u00b7 entertainment -- Such an entertainment is provided not only to the members of the appellant-Clubs, but also to the general public on payment of a certain admission fee. s. 1 (5) - 'Establishment' - 'shop' - Chit Fund - Held: In light of the fact that appellant-Chit Fund provides for seNices and in return the foreman receives a commission, there C existing a systematic commercial activity and a rendering of seNices taking place, activities of Chit Fund would be those as would fall um:Jer the definition of a shop as evolved by the Court -- Therefore, in accordance with the reasoning if] Civil Appeal No.2416 of 2003 and other connected appeals, D appellant chit fund would fall within the meaning of the word 'shop' as mentioned in the notification issued under ES/ Act -- Therefore, provisions of ES/ Act would extend to appellant also - Government of Tamil Nadu Notification No. 11(2)/LEI 1859176 dated 03.04.1976. INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES: Statutes pari materia -- Maharashtra Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, Kamataka Shops and Commercial Establishments Act, 1961 and ES/ Act--Held: Statutes are F said to be in pari materia with each other when they deal with the same subject-matter -- The rationale behind this rule is based on the interpretative assumption that words employed in legislations are used in an identical sense --However, this assumption is rebuttable by the context of the statutes -- ES/ G Act, the Act, 1948 and the Act, 1961 deal with labour and workmen, in essence and spirit they have a different scope and application -- The Acts do not appear to have any overlap\u00b7 in their fields of operation and have mutually exclusive schemes -- Therefore, it cannot be said that the said Acts are H pari materia with each other. Liberal and beneficial interpretation -- Beneficial A legislation for welfare of workmen and employees -- Held: In the case of beneficial legislations and legislations enacted for welfare of employees and workmen, Court has on numerous occasions adopted liberal rule of interpretation to ensure that the benefits extend to those workers who need to be covered B based on the intention of the Legislature -- Since ES/ Act is passed for conferring certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity and employment injury, it is necessary that ES/ Act should receive a liberal and beneficial construction so as to achieve legislative purpose without c doing violence to the language of the enactment -- In light of the judgments of the Court and in particular Cochin Shipping Case and the Bombay.Anand Bhavan Case, an expansive meaning may be assigned to the word 'shop' for the purposes of the ES/ Act. D Beneficial legislation - ES/ Act - Certain terms not defined in the Act - Resort to dictionary meaning and judicial pronouncements - Explained. "

C Freedom Fighter Pension is a form of gratitude extended by an indebted nation in recognition of the sacrifice made by the freedom fighters to achieving independence - Liberal approach has to be adopted in such matters so that rightful persons are not deprived of deserving benefit for lack of evidence, after a lapse of long time - Such cases have to be decided on preponderance of probabilities and standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt is not to be applied. EVIDENCE: Documentary evidence - Held: Has to prevail over oral evidence. Determination of age by the Medical Board - Evidentiary value of - Held: Not reliable as it is based upon physical appearance only and not based upon any scientific medical test like ossification test and radiological examination - When it is based on such scientific tests, it is, of strong corroborative value - In the instant case, Medical Board opined on physical B appearance basis age of the claimant about 73 years - As it is not based on scientific tests it cannot be accepted.
