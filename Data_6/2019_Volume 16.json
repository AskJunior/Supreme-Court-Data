Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) pronounced thenature of the impugned enactment without first delineating thescope of Art.110(1) and principles for interpretation or therepercussions of such process \u2013 The majority dictum in K.S.Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) did not substantially discuss the effect ofthe word \u2018only\u2019 in Art.110(1) and offers little guidance on therepercussions of a finding when some of the provisions of anenactment passed as a \u2018Money Bill\u2019 do not conform to Art. 110 (1)(a) (b) \u2013 Without expressing a firm and final opinion, the analysisin K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) made its application difficult tothe present case and raises a potential conflict between thejudgments of Coordinate Benches \u2013 Being a Bench of equalstrength as that in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5), the batch ofmatters directed to be referred to the Larger Bench.Tribunals \u2013 Finance Act, 2017 \u2013 S. 184 \u2013 Constitutionalityof s. 184 on account of excessive delegations \u2013 Held s.184 doesnot suffer from excessive delegations of legislative functions asthere are adequate principles to guide framing of delegatedlegislation, which would include the binding dictums of theSupreme Court \u2013 The objects of the parent enactments as well asthe law laid down by the Supreme Court in R.K. Jain, L. ChandraKumar, R. Gandhi, Madras Bar Association and Gujarat UrjaVikas undoubtedly bind the delegate and mandatorily requires thedelegate u/s. 184 to act strictly in conformity with these decisionsand the objects of delegated legislation stipulated in the statutes. Tribunals \u2013 The Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and otherAuthorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions ofService of Members) Rules, 2017 \u2013 Conformity of the Rules withthe judicial principles inherent in the Constitutional scheme asestablished by the Supreme Court \u2013 Held: The composition of thesearch-cum-Selection Committees under the Rules amounts toexcessive interference of the Executive in appointment of membersand presiding offices of statutory Tribunals and it is detrimentalto the independence of Judiciary \u2013 In addition to this, there hasbeen a blatant dilution of judicial character in appointmentswhereby candidates without any judicial experience are prescribedto be eligible for adjudicatory posts such as that of the presidingOfficer \u2013 Therefore, the Rules have an effect of dilution of thejudicial character in adjudicatory positions \u2013 Further, earlierremoval of members or presiding officer was done after an enquiryby the Supreme Court Judges and with necessary consultation withthe Chief Justice of India, under the present Rules it is permissiblefor the Central Government to appoint an enquiry Committee forremoval of any presiding officer or member on its own \u2013 TheMembers and Presiding Officers of Tribunals cannot be removedwithout either the concurrence of the Judiciary or in the mannerspecified in the Constitution for Constitutional Court Judges \u2013 Also,there must be uniform age of superannuation for all members inall the Tribunals, the Rules demonstrate disparity in age ofsuperannuation of Members and Chairpersons/Presiding Officersof different Tribunals \u2013 Furthermore, there is inconsistency withinthe Rules with regard to the tenure prescribed for the Members ofTribunals insofar as a fixed tenure of three years for both directappointments from the Bar and appointment of retired judicialofficers or judges of High Court or Supreme Court \u2013 It is alsodiscriminatory to the extent that it attempts to create equalitybetween unequal classes \u2013 Therefore, the Rules suffer from variousinfirmities and are contrary to the Parent enactment and theprinciples envisaged in the Constitution, resultantly, directed to bestruck down in entirety.Tribunals \u2013 Finance Act, 2017 \u2013 Whether there should be asingle Nodal Agency for administration of all Tribunals \u2013 Held: Itmay not be very crucial as to which Ministry or Departmentperforms the duties of Nodal Agency for a Tribunal, but what is of utmost importance is that the Tribunal should not be expectedto look towards such Nodal Agency for its day to day requirements\u2013 There must be a direction to allocate adequate and sufficientfunds for each Tribunal to make it self-sufficient and selfsustainableauthority for all intents and purposes.Tribunals \u2013 A Judicial Impact Assessment of all tribunals inIndia \u2013 Need for \u2013 Held: It was directed in Salem Advocate BarAssociation (II) v. Union of India for a Committee to be constitutedto assess the need for Judicial Impact Assessment \u2013 Pursuantthereto, Jagannadha Rao Committee Report was submitted, itsuggested that legislature must analyse the budgetary requirementof the staff, additional expenditure arising out of the new casesconsequent to the enactment, the number of Civil and CriminalCases expected to arise from the new enactment, the requirementof Judges etc. \u2013 The legislature has not conformed to the opinionof the Supreme Court with respect to \u2018Judicial Impact Assessment\u2019and thus, has not made any attempt to assess the ramifications ofthe Finance Act, 2017 \u2013 Therefore, the Union of India directed tocarry out Financial Impact Assessment in respect of all theTribunals referable to ss. 158 to 182 of the Finance Act, 2017 andundertake an exercise to assess the need based requirements andmake available sufficient resources for each Tribunal establishedby the Parliament.Tribunals \u2013 Judges of Tribunals set up by Acts of Parliamentunder Arts. 323-A and 323-B of the Constitution equated in \u2018Rank\u2019and \u2018Status\u2019 with constitutional functionaries \u2013 Held: There can beno doubt that executive action cannot confer status equivalent tothat either Supreme Court or High Court Judges on any memberor head of any Tribunal or other judicial fora \u2013 Tribunals are notsubstitutes of Superior Courts and are only supplemental to them\u2013 Hence, the status of members of such Tribunals cannot beequated with that of the sitting Judges of Constitutional Courts.Tribunals \u2013 Direct Statutory appeals from Tribunals to theSupreme Court \u2013 Consideration of \u2013 Held: Such statutory appealstake away the inherent ability of the Supreme Court, as envisagedin the Constitution, to regulate cases before it by confining itsconsideration to cases involving the most egregious of wrongs and/or having the greatest impact on public interest \u2013 It is evident thatSupreme Court has lost its original character owing to the routine hearing of appeals through invocation of the discretionaryjurisdiction u/Art. 136 \u2013 For the discharge of constitutionalfunctions of deliberating on substantial questions of law, answeringconstitutional questions and resolving other issues of great Publicimportance, it is essential that Supreme Court has adequate timeto apply its mind and consider matters in depth the practice ofbringing every second case before the Supreme Court u/Art. 136must be deprecated \u2013 Therefore, the Union of India in consultationwith either the Law Commission or any other expert body revisitsuch provisions under various enactments providing for directappeals to the Supreme Court against orders of Tribunals, andinstead provide appeals to Division Benches of the High Courts,if at all necessary.Tribunals \u2013 Amalgamation of Existing Tribunals and settingup of Benches \u2013 Need for \u2013 Held: The \u2018importance\u2019 in distributionof case-load and inconsistencies in nature, location andfunctioning of Tribunals require urgent attention \u2013 It is essentialthat after conducting a Judicial Impact Assessment, Tribunals beamalgamed with others dealing with similar areas of law, to ensureeffective utilisation of resources and to facilitate access to justice\u2013 Therefore, the Union Government directed to carry out anappropriate exercise for amalgamation of existing Tribunalsadopting the test of homogeneity of the subject matters to be dealtwith and thereafter constitute adequate number of BenchesCommensurate with the existing and anticipated volume of work."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 National CompanyLaw Tribunal- Adjudicating Authority and National Company LawAppellate Tribunal-Appellate Tribunal under \u2013 Jurisdiction of, quaresolution approved by Committee of Creditors \u2013 Held: AdjudicatingAuthority\u2019s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 30(2) and AppellateTribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is circumscribed by s. 32 rw s. 61(3) -Adjudicating Authority cannot interfere on merits with thecommercial decision taken by the Committee of Creditors, thelimited judicial review available is to see that the Committee ofCreditors has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtorneeds to keep going as a going concern during the insolvencyresolution process; that it needs to maximise the value of its assets;and that the interests of all stakeholders including operationalcreditors has been taken care of - If the Adjudicating Authorityfinds, on a given set of facts, that the said parameters have notbeen kept in view, it may send a resolution plan back to theCommittee of Creditors to re-submit such plan after satisfying thesaid parameters - Reasons given by the Committee of Creditorswhile approving a resolution plan may be looked at by theAdjudicating Authority only from this point of view, and once it issatisfied that Committee of Creditors has paid attention to thesekey features, it must then pass the resolution plan, other thingsbeing equal.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Secured andunsecured creditors \u2013 Equality principle \u2013 Held: Secured andunsecured financial creditors are differentiated when it comes toamounts to be paid under a resolution plan, together with whatdissenting secured or unsecured financial creditors are to be paid- Operational creditors are separately viewed from these securedand unsecured financial creditors in S.No.5 of paragraph 7 ofstatutory Form H - Thus, it can be seen that the Code and theRegulations, read as a whole, lead to the conclusion that theequality principle cannot be stretched to treating unequals equally,as that will destroy the very objective of the Code to resolve stressedassets - Equitable treatment is to be accorded to each creditordepending upon the class to which it belongs: secured orunsecured, financial or operational Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s. 21(8), 28 -Constitution of a sub-committee by the Committee of Creditors \u2013Permissibility of \u2013 Plea that the Committee of Creditors delegatedits functions to a sub-committee, as a result of which, the subcommitteesecretly made negotiations with ArcelorMittal \u2013 Held:Section 28(1)(h) provides that though the powers of Committee ofCreditors are administrative in nature, they shall not be delegatedto any other person \u2013 Power of approval of resolution plan u/s.30(4), also cannot be delegated to any other body - However, subcommitteescan be appointed for the purpose of negotiating withresolution applicants, or for performing other ministerial oradministrative acts, provided such acts are in the ultimate analysisapproved and ratified by the Committee of Creditors \u2013 On facts,every single administrat ive decision qua approving andadministering the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal wasin fact done by the requisite majority of the Committee of Creditorsitself, the sub-committee having been used only for purposes ofinitiating proceedings and negotiating with ArcelorMittal, whichultimately culminated in the resolution plan as finally negotiated,being passed by the requisite majority of creditors - StandardChartered Bank voted in favour of the constitution of a subcommitteeand also requested for inclusion of its name in sub-Committee, however, when the Standard Chartered Bank found thatthings were going against it that it started raising objections onthe technical plea that sub-committees cannot be constituted underthe Code, thus, plea was not bonafide and is rejected.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s. 31(1) -Extinguishment of Personal Guarantees and Undecided Claims \u2013Held: s. 31(1) makes it clear that once a resolution plan isapproved by the Committee of Creditors it shall be binding on allstakeholders, including guarantors \u2013 It cannot be said that partof the resolution plan which states that the claims of the guarantoron account of subrogation shall be extinguished, cannot be appliedto the guarantees furnished by the erstwhile directors of thecorporate debtor \u2013 A successful resolution applicant cannotsuddenly be faced with \u201cundecided\u201d claims after the resolution plansubmitted by him has been accepted as this would lead touncertainty regarding amounts payable by a prospective resolutionapplicant who successfully took over the business of the corporate debtor - All claims must be submitted to and decided by theresolution professional so that a prospective resolution applicantknows exactly what has to be paid in order that it may then takeover and run the business of the corporate debtor - Successfulresolution applicant does on a fresh slate.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2019 \u2013ss. 4 and 6 \u2013 Constitutional Validity of \u2013 Held: As regards s. 4 ofthe Amendment Act, it is clear that as per s. 12 of the principalAct, the Corporate Insolvency Resolution proceedings should bemandatorily completed within a period of 330 days including anyextension and legal proceedings related to resolution process ofcorporate debtor \u2013 Further grace period of 90 days is given,failing which corporate debtor shall be sent into liquidation \u2013 Whileleaving the provision otherwise intact, the word \u201cmandatorily\u201d isstruck down as being manifestly arbitrary under Article 14 of theConstitution and as being an excessive and unreasonablerestriction on the litigant\u2019s right to carry on business under Article19(1)(g) of the Constitution \u2013 As regards, the substitution of s.30(2)(b) by s. 6 of the Amending Act of 2019, it is constitutionallyvalid since the substituted s. 30(2)(b) is in fact a beneficialprovision in favour of operational creditors and dissentientfinancial creditors as they are now to be paid a certain minimumamount, the minimum in the case of operational creditors being thehigher of the two figures calculated under sub-clauses (i) and (ii)of clause (b), and the minimum in the case of dissentient financialcreditor being a minimum amount that was not earlier payable \u2013Furthermore, Explanation 1 and 2 as also sub-clause (b) of s. 6of the Amending Act of 2019, is constitutionally valid."

A \u201cconstitutional mandate\u201dcan be understood as what is required under, or by, theConstitution \u2013 In the context of the Tenth Schedule, and an orderof disqualification passed by the Speaker thereunder, the\u201cconstitutional mandate\u201d is therefore nothing but what isconstitutionally required of the Speaker \u2013 A \u201cviolation ofconstitutional mandate\u201d is merely an unconstitutional act of theSpeaker, one that cannot be defended on the touch-stone of theTenth Schedule and the powers or duties of the Speaker thereinand is in contravention or violation of the same \u2013 Constitution(Fifty-second Amendment) Act, 1985 \u2013 Tenth Schedule."
