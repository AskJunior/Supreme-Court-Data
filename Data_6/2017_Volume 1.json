I 8 of the policy decision whereby 3 month's notice was required to be given before resuming the possession of the land and directed the Corporation to lease out the fond to the proposed allottee - On appeal, held: Under s. 33, Corporation can dispose of the land subject to directions given by the State Government and subject to such terms and conditions as are necessary - Execution of lease-deed was condition precedent for allotment of land - Since th:\u00b7 r_-:.;.;e-deed was never executed, the relationship of lessor-lesseenever came into being - Thus Cl. 18 of policy decision never came into force as no concluded contract came into being and the transaction became void - Therefore, it is not necessary to serve three months' notice before resumption of land and resumption was ;ustified - Forfeiture of amount for use and occupation of land and for damages was also appropriate as compensation could be claimed u/s. 70 of Contract Act - In the facts of the case, principle of promissory estoppel is not attracted as no assurance was given by the Corporation - Cost of Rs. 5 lakhs imposed on the respondent (proposed al/ottee) - Contract Act, 1872 - s. 70 - Administrative Law - Principle of Promissory Estoppel.
