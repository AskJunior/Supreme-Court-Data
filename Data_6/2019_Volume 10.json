Rs.22,951 and that Rs.3,500was paid as earnest money; that plaintiffs further paid Rs.2,000 on24.9.1965 and took possession of 25 acres of land \u2013 Plaintiff furtheraverred that defendants executed a supplementary agreement forsale and accepted an additional sum of Rs.500 from plaintiffs andhanded over the remaining portion of land to plaintiffs and theremaining sale consideration was settled at Rs.11,951 after deductingRs.5,000 towards encumbrances and on payment of this amountdefendants 1 to 3 were liable to execute the sale deed in their favour\u2013 Case of defendants 1 to 3 (vendors) was that the said agreementswere executed only as collateral security for a loan advanced byplaintiff no.1 and not for sale of property \u2013 Held: There was noteven a remote suggestion in the agreements that there was any loanor borrowing transaction between the parties and the saidagreements were being executing towards security \u2013 On the contrary,the recitals and stipulations in the agreements were only inaffirmation of the agreement for sale and of the receipt of partpayment from time to time against the sale consideration \u2013 As towhether the possession of the land in question was delivered to theplaintiffs or not, could not have been taken as a factor decisive asregards nature of transact ion \u2013 Moreover, execution of thesupplementary agreement after notice and after receiving furtheran amount of Rs. 500/- by defendant Nos. 1 to 3 could only show re-affirmation of the intention of the parties towards the saletransaction \u2013 In the supplementary agreement, the defendants notonly acknowledged the receipt of part consideration to the tune ofRs. 6,000/- but further agreed for adjustment of Rs. 5,000/- towardsencumbrances and, therefore, agreed to receive remaining Rs.11,921/- at the time of execution of the sale deed \u2013 In view of thedealings of the parties, this circumstance about execution of thesupplementary agreement only strengthened the case of the plaintiffs.Specific Relief Act, 1963: Specific performance \u2013 Readinessand willingness of plaintiff to perform his part of the contract \u2013The plaintiffs pleaded in the plaint that they were ready to get thesale deed executed as per the conditions in the agreement for saleand also stated that they served the notice, then supplementaryagreement was executed; and then, on many occasions, they askedthe defendant to execute the sale deed \u2013 Defendant No.1 in hiswritten statement merely stated a bald denial that such avermentswere false and were \u2018not agreeable to the defendants\u2019 \u2013 The entireemphasis of the written statement was on the assertion that theagreement in question was not for sale and was obtained by theplaintiffs towards security against the amount borrowed by defendantNo.1 \u2013 Held: The plea of the plaintiffs as regards their readiness toperform the contract as per its conditions did not meet withcategorical denial from the defendants \u2013 This apart, even at thetime of entering into the agreement, the plaintiffs paid Rs. 3,500/-against the sale consideration of Rs. 22,951/- \u2013 Moreover, and muchbefore the stipulated date of execution of sale deed, they madeanother payment of Rs. 2,000/- against the sale consideration \u2013When the sale deed was not executed within stipulated time, theplaintiffs served notice \u2013 Defendants thereafter executed thesupplementary agreement and the plaintiffs made payment of yetanother sum of Rs. 500/- while it was also agreed by the vendorsthat the property carried encumbrance to the tune of Rs. 5,000/-,which was to be adjusted against the sale consideration \u2013 Therefore,the plaintiffs were left to make payment of about half of the saleconsideration \u2013 The plaintiffs showed their readiness and willingnessto perform their part of the contract and there did not operate anypersonal bar against their claim for specific performance.Transfer of Property Act, 1882: s.52 \u2013 Doctrine of lispendens \u2013 Both the sale transactions in favour of the appellants,purporting to transfer the suit property in part, having been effectedafter filing of the suit, were directly hit by the doctrine of lis pendens,as embodied in s.52 of the Act, 1882 \u2013 Specific Relief Act, 1963.Transfer of Property Act, 1882: s.52 \u2013 Effect of doctrine oflis pendens \u2013 Held: Is not to annul all the transfers effected by theparties to a suit but only to render them subservient to the rights ofthe parties under the decree or order which may be made in thatsuit \u2013 Its effect is only to make the decree passed in the suit bindingon the transferee, i.e., the subsequent purchaser \u2013 Nevertheless,the transfer remains valid subject, of course, to the result of thesuit \u2013 Hence, the effect of s.52, for the purpose of the instant casewould only be that the said sale transactions in favour of thesubsequent purchasers shall have no adverse effect on the rightsof the plaintiffs and shall remain subject to the final outcome of thesuit in question \u2013 However, the High Court, while holding that thesaid transactions were hit by lis pendens, proceeded to observefurther that the sale deeds so made in favour of the subsequentpurchasers were illegal \u2013 These observations by the High Court notapproved.Specific Relief Act, 1963: Requirement to prove readiness andwillingness of plaintiff to perform his part of the contract is not thatthe plaintiff should continuously approach the defendant withpayment or make incessant requests for performance \u2013 For the reliefof specific performance, which is essentially a species of equity buthas got statutory recognition in terms of the Specific Relief Act, theplaintiff must be found standing with the contract and the plaintiff \u2019sconduct should not be carrying any such blameworthiness so as tobe considered inequitable.Specific Relief Act, 1963: Limitation \u2013 When the plaintiffshad the limitation of three years for filing the suit for specificperformance, it cannot be said that during the said period, theplaintiffs are required to show overt act by them in furtherance ofthe agreement in question \u2013 In the instant case, when the plaintiffshad the limitation of three years for filing the suit and have indeedfiled the suit well within limitation, no aspect of delay operatesagainst them \u2013Limitation \u2013 Delay/Latches.Specific Relief Act, 1963: ss.21 and 22 \u2013 Grant of relief \u2013Agreements in question were executed way back on 20.09.1965 and28.04.1966 \u2013 The evidence on record showed that vendors andthereafter, the subsequent purchasers remained in effectivepossession thereof \u2013 High Court took note of the fact that as on thedate of its decision, the subsequent purchasers were in possessionof the land in question for about 40 years \u2013 High Court found thatland in question carried much higher valuation at the time of passingof the judgment in second appeal and hence, enhanced the saleconsideration to Rs. 10,000/- per acre \u2013 Plaintiffs, even while seekingspecific performance, prayed for the alternative reliefs of recoveryof amount paid by them with interest and compensation to the tuneof Rs 15,000/- \u2013 Plaintiff No. 1 expired during the pendency of suitand plaintiff No. 2 expired during the pendency of this appeal;though legal representative of plaintiff Nos. 1 and 2 was on recordas plaintiff No.4 (respondent No. 2) \u2013 Plaintiff No.2, while deposingas PW2 had stated that in case specific performance was notgranted, she \u2018may be granted alternative relief and compensationwith interest\u2019 \u2013 In view of this, instead of specific performance,awarding of monetary compensation to respondent No. 2 wouldmeet the ends of justice \u2013 Subsequent purchasers themselves filedvaluation report suggesting that the market value of unirrigatedland was Rs. 70,000/- per hectare whereas that of the irrigatedland was Rs. 1,40,000/- per hectare \u2013 The fact also remained thatthe appellants have been enjoying the land in question for a longlength of time \u2013 Further, the predecessors of respondent No. 2 madepayment of the sum of Rs. 6,000/- to the vendors in the years 1965-1966; and the plaintiffs had claimed alternative relief of recoveryof the said amount together with interest as also of compensation \u2013Taking all the relevant factors into account, a lump sum of Rs.15,00,000/- is awarded to respondent No. 2 as compensation inlieu of specific performance \u2013 Equity."

that the amendment is discriminatory inasmuch asit treats unequals equally, and equals unequally, having no intelligibledifferentia; and that there is no nexus with the objects sought to beachieved by the Code \u2013 Held: Amendment Act to the Code does notinfringe Arts 14, 19(1)(g) rw Art. 19(6), or 300-A \u2013 Home buyers/allottees give advance to the real estate developer and therebyfinance the real estate project at hand, are really financial creditors\u2013 Objects of the Code are sub-served by treating allottees as financialcreditors \u2013 Code is, thus a beneficial legislation which can be invoked by unsecured creditors like allottees against the corporatedebtor so that a replaced management may then carry out the realestate project as originally envisaged \u2013 It cannot be said that Art.19(1)(g) has been infracted and not saved by Art. 19(6) as theAmendment Act is made in public interest \u2013 There is no unreasonablerestriction on the petitioner\u2019s fundamental right u/Art. 19(1)(g) \u2013Also, there is no infraction of Art. 300-A as no person is deprivedof its property without authority of a constitutionally valid law \u2013Furthermore, it cannot be said that classifying real estate developersis not founded upon an intelligible differentia which distinguishesthem from other operational creditors \u2013 Allottees, being individualfinancial creditors like debenture holders and fixed deposit holdersand classified as such, show that they within the larger class offinancial creditors, there being no infraction of Art. 14 \u2013 Insolvencyand Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 \u2013 Constitutionof India \u2013 Arts 14, 19(1)(g) rw Art 19(6), or 300-A.s. 7 \u2013 Application u/s. 7 by allottee/home buyer \u2013 Effect of \u2013Held: Code is not meant to be a debt recovery mechanism \u2013 It is aproceeding in rem which, after being triggered, goes completelyoutside the control of the allottee who triggers it \u2013 Thus, any allottee/home buyer who prefers an application u/s. 7 takes the risk of hisflat/apartment not being completed in the near future, in the eventof there being a breach on the part of the developer \u2013 Under theCode, he may never get a refund of the entire principal, let aloneinterest \u2013 After the petition is admitted u/s. 7, a resolution plan istaken up, usually by another developer, who has to pass musterunder the Code and must further go through challenges before NCLTand NCLAT before the new management can take over and eithercomplete construction, or pay out or refund amounts \u2013 Thus, giventhe bonafides of the allottee who moves an application u/s. 7, it isonly such allottee who has completely lost faith in the managementof the real estate developer who would come before NCLT underthe Code.ss. 21(6A) and 25A \u2013 Committee of creditors \u2013 Rights andduties of authorized representatives of financial creditors \u2013Challenge to ss. 21(6A) and 25A \u2013 Held: Allottees may not be ahomogenous group, yet there are only two ways in which they canvote on the Committee of Creditors, either to approve or to disapprove of a proposed resolution plan \u2013 Under s. 25A(3A) theauthorised representative now casts his vote on behalf of allfinancial creditors that he represents \u2013 If a decision taken by a voteof more than 50% of the voting share of the financial creditors thathe represents is that a particular plan be either accepted or rejected,it is clear that the minority of those who vote, and all others, willnow be bound by this decision \u2013 Legislature must be given freedomto experiment \u2013 Thus, any challenge to machinery provisionscontained in ss. 21(6A) and 25A cannot be accepted.s. 5(8)(f) \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Plea that s. 5(8)(f), as itoriginally stood, is an exhaustive provision which must be readnoscitur a sociis, and if so read, sub-clause (f) must take colour fromthe other clauses of the provision; that an allottee under a realestate project cannot fall within s. 5(8)(f), as it originally stood andthe explanation must then be read prospectively; that since s. 5(8)is a \u201cmeans and includes\u201d definition clause, it is exhaustive , thus,to then introduce by way of amendment something extra by meansof a deeming fiction is not permissible \u2013 Held: Section 5(8)(f) as itoriginally appeared in the Code being a residuary provision, alwayssubsumed within it allottees of flats/apartments \u2013 Explanationtogether with the deeming fiction added by the Amendment Act isonly clarificatory of this position in law that had arisen as to whetherhome buyers/allottees were subsumed within s. 5(8)(f) \u2013 Explanationadded to s. 5(8)(f) does not in fact enlarge the scope of the originalSection \u2013 Thus, the allottees/home buyers were included in s. 5(8)(f)with effect from the inception of the Code, the explanation beingadded in 2018 merely to clarify doubts that had arisen.s. 5(8)(f) explanation \u2013 Effect of a deeming fiction \u2013 Held:Deeming fiction that is used by the explanation is to put beyonddoubt the fact that allottees are to be regarded as financial creditorswithin the enacting part contained in s. 5(8)(f) \u2013 Under theexplanation added to s. 5(8)(f), any amount raised from an allotteeunder a real estate project shall be deemed to be an amount havingthe commercial effect of a borrowing \u2013 Although a deeming provisionis to deem what is not there in reality, thereby requiring the subjectmatter to be treated as if it were real, yet several authorities andjudgments show that a deeming fiction can also be used to putbeyond doubt a particular construction that might otherwise beuncertain.Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016: ss. 2,20 to 39, 41 to 58, 71 to 78 and 81 to 92 \u2013 Impact of the RERA onthe real estate sector \u2013 Stated.Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of \u2018Reading Down\u2019 \u2013Application of \u2013 Matter pertaining to constitutional validity of theInsolvency Code (Second Amendment) Act \u2013 Plea that if theconstitutional validity of the impugned provisions is to be upheld,then the amendment to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code needsto be read-down so as to make it conform with Art. 14 and 19(1)(g)and 300-A \u2013 Held: In application u/s. 7 made by an allottee, theNCLT\u2019s \u2018satisfaction\u2019 will be with both eyes open \u2013 NCLT will notignore a legitimate defences by a real estate developer \u2013 Furthermore,the Amendment Act has been held to be constitutionally valid, andconsidering that its language is clear and unambiguous, there is nonecessity to read into or read down any of these provisions \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Act, 2018 \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.Legislation: Economic legislation-Insolvency Code \u2013Legislature\u2019s right to experiment in economic matters \u2013 Held:Insolvency Code is a legislation which deals with economic mattersand, in the larger sense, deals with the economy of the country as awhole \u2013 While dealing with economic legislation, the legislaturemust be given liberty \u2013 Legislative judgment in economic choicesmust be given a certain degree of deference by the courts \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016"

        "HeadNote": "Electricity : Pursuant to the policy decision of StateGovernment to allow the private agencies to set up hydel schemes,the appellant was allowed to set up a Hydro Electric Project \u2013 MoUwas executed between the appellant and the KSEB \u2013 In terms of theMoU, the appellant would operate the unit for 30 years from thedate of commissioning i.e. the date from which the power generatedby the appellant is fed into the KSEB grid \u2013 The MoU contemplatedthat the transmission line required for transferring power from thepower house to the nearest grid sub-station upto a length of 4 Kms.would be built by KSEB at the cost of the appellant and rest of thetransmission line was to be constructed by the KSEB at its own cost\u2013 Delay in construction of transmission line led to institution of writpetition by appellant before High Court wherein appellant claimedpower free of cost in terms of clause 9 and 10 of the agreement andsought direction for expeditious construction of transmission line \u2013Pursuant to interim order, the Chief Electrical Inspector filed a reportto the effect that the installation of transformers was completed bythe appellant on 21 August 2000 but the sanction for energizationof 110 KV was not issued since the transmission lines were not ready\u2013 High Court directed the State Government to deal with therepresentations submitted by the appellant \u2013 Pursuant to order ofHigh Court, State Government passed order on 7 February 2001opining inter alia that appellant was not entitled to the benefit ofthe pre 1992 tariff concession till the completion of the transmissionline by KSEB; that the delay in the construction of the transmissionlines was not deliberate and was due to factors beyond control;that the tariff concessions were provided to new industries which isa distinct issue from captive power generation and hence the plea for a tariff concession could not be acceded to; and having regardto the grievance of the appellant that it had been unable to evacuatethe power which it was positioned to generate for its captive unit,KSEB ought to adhere to the time schedule which it had undertakento fulfill and complete the construction of the transmission lines by28 February 2001 without fail \u2013 High Court dismissed the writpetition eventually holding that there was no intentional delay inconstruction of the transmission lines on the part of KSEB; that thetariff concession was made available only to new industries; andthat the agreement between the parties did not disclose any specifiedtime limit for the provision of transmission lines \u2013 On appeal, held:The agreement stipulated that the date of commissioning would beconstrued as the date from which the power generated by the unitsset up by the appellant was fed into KSEB grid \u2013 Though the contractdid not specify the exact length of the transmission line, clause 9made it clear that for a length of 4 kms, construction would be atthe cost and expense of the appellant while the balance would beconstructed by KSEB at its own cost \u2013 Clause 3 postulated thatcommercial operations would begin within a period of 30 months \u2013Thus, the only reasonable construction of the contract would bethat the obligations which were to be performed by KSEB, namely,the construction of the transmission line must necessarily becompleted within the same period \u2013 Otherwise imposing anobligation upon the appellant to commence commercial operationswithin 30 months would have no meaning \u2013 Therefore, High Courtwas not correct in holding that the contract did not stipulate anytimelines for the completion of the work of constructing thetransmission line \u2013 Clause 12 of the agreement contemplated asituation where the KSEB grid is not in a position to absorb theenergy generated from the project for any reason including thebreakdown of transmission lines or any other reason beyond thecontrol of KSEB \u2013 In that event, clause 12 provided the generationfrom the project to be restricted to the extent of generation for captiveconsumption as directed by KSEB \u2013 These provisions indicated thatthe contract was not entirely silent in regard to a situation involvingthe inability of KSEB\u2019s grid to absorb the energy generated fromthe project for any reason \u2013 The report of the Chief Electricalinspector made it clear that it was as a result of the delay whichtook place in the construction of the transmission line that the actual injection of power into the grid could not take place \u2013 This clearlyshowed that the appellant had duly fulfilled its obligation of settingup Phase I and Phase II of its units and the only reason why it wasunable to inject power into the grid was because the setting up ofthe transmission lines by KSEB could not take place \u2013 Thus, thebasis on which State Government took a decision on 7 February2001 and High Court affirmed it by its impugned judgment wouldneed to be re-visited \u2013 Appellant was not entitled to the grant ofdeemed generation status as a matter of right \u2013 Similarly, theconcessional power tariff applicable for a period of five years from1994 to 1999 was extended until 20 August 2000 \u2013 This isundoubtedly a matter of policy and the High Court was justified incoming to the conclusion that it was not open to the Court to foist aparticular measure of policy on the State \u2013 State Government toreassess the matter in proper perspective within the availableframework of law and its own policy.Administrative Law: Contractual matters \u2013 Judicial review \u2013Scope of interference \u2013 Held: It is now a settled principle of lawthat the exercise of writ jurisdiction under Art.226 is not excludedin matters pertaining to contract \u2013 The States and its agencies areduty bound to act in a manner which is fair and transparent \u2013 Theycannot act arbitrarily in dealings with private parties \u2013 This mustparticularly be the governing principle where the State as a measureof encouraging industrialisation invites the participation of privateindustries to respond to the policy initiative of the State \u2013 Electricity.Deeds and documents: Interpretation of commercial documents\u2013 In construing a commercial document, the contract must be readand understood in its entirety so as to attribute to it a businessmeaning which was within the understanding of the contractingparties \u2013 Electricity"

Contracts entered into between privateparties \u2013 Held: Are not subject to scrutiny under writ jurisdiction.Party/Parties: Necessary party \u2013 Tender \u2013 Rejection \u2013 Writpetition \u2013 Maintainability when all the tenderer are not parties inthe petition \u2013 In the instant case, the Division Bench of High Courtheld that writ petition was not maintainable without making all thetenderer parties to the petitions \u2013 Held: The Division Bench of theHigh Court erred in holding that in all cases challenging thedecision of the tendering authority, all the eligible tenderers shouldbe made parties \u2013 Such a broad proposition could not be laid downas an inflexible rule of law \u2013 In the instant case, the petitioner wasonly challenging the rejection of its technical bid \u2013 At this stage,the other tenderers were not necessary parties \u2013 The position maybe otherwise, if a tenderer challenges a bid awarded to another orchallenges the rejection of his bid at a later stage \u2013 The writ petitionwas maintainable even in the absence of other tenderers becausetill that stage there was no successful tenderer.Contract: Related firms \u2013 Whether the petitioner firm and thesister company are \u201cRelated Firms\u201d, within the meaning of Clause1.19 of the Manual of Contracts, 2007 \u2013 It is not disputed that allthe partners of the petitioner firm are the directors of the sistercompany and, therefore, there can be no manner of doubt that thepetitioner firm and the sister company are related firms having abusiness relationship \u2013 Therefore, adverse remarks made againstthe sister concern can be used against the petitioner firm.B Contract: Tender of petitioner was rejected inter alia on theground that adverse remarks were made against sister concern ofthe petitioner-tenderer in respect of workload return of \u2018SS\u2019 Classcontractors and non-renewal of its enlistment \u2013 Division Bench ofHigh Court held that the adverse remarks recorded against the sistercompany could not be gone into in the absence of any challenge bythe sister company \u2013 Held: If the tendering authority is using anyadverse material of the sister company against the petitioner firmthen the petitioner firm would be entitled to urge that the adverseremarks were not called for or that the adverse remarks were notjustified or that the adverse remarks were not to be taken intoconsideration while considering the tender of the petitioner firm \u2013However, it is noted that in the instant case, the sister company notonly did not get its enlistment renewed but also did not care to evenrepresent against the adverse remarks \u2013 The eligibility criteriaprovided in the tender laid down that there should be no adverseremarks in the WLR of the competent engineering authority \u2013Admittedly, there were adverse remarks in Work Load Return (WLR)of the sister company \u2013 The sister company having realised that itwould not be awarded any contract, neither got its enlistmentrenewed nor tried to submit the tender \u2013 The directors of the sistercompany tried to get over these insurmountable objections byapplying for the tender in the name of the petitioner firm \u2013 All thedirectors of the sister company were partners in the petitioner firm\u2013 Therefore, these adverse remarks passed against the sister companycould not be ignored.Contract: Tender \u2013 Eligibility criteria \u2013 In the instant case,as per the eligibility criteria for MES enlisted contractors, onlycontractors falling in \u201cSS Class\u201d were eligible to apply \u2013 Admittedly,the petitioner firm was not an enlisted contractor and was, therefore,required to meet the eligibility criteria for \u201cother contractors\u201d \u2013 Asfar as \u201cother contractors\u201d were concerned, they were required tomeet the same criteria as \u201cSS\u201d MES contractors category and thesecontractors were specifically told that they could see enlistmentcriteria in the MES Manual Contracts \u2013 The Manual also providedcriteria for enlisting of contractors \u2013 Therefore, only companiesincorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, were eligible to beenlisted as \u2018SS\u2019 Class Contractors \u2013 Furthermore, Clause 1.5 dealtwith the documents to be submitted by the contractor for enlistmentin MES \u2013 This again would show that only limited companies couldbe enlisted in \u2018SS\u2019 Class \u2013 \u2018SS\u2019 is the highest class and for that onlyincorporated companies can apply \u2013 Therefore, the petitioner wasnot eligible to submit the tender.Administrative Law: Administrative decisions \u2013 Contract \u2013Rejection of tender \u2013 Whether the appellate orders rejecting tenderswere bad since they were without reasons \u2013 Held: While rejectingthe tender the person or authority inviting the tenders is not requiredto give reasons even if it be a State within the meaning of Art.12 ofthe Constitution \u2013 These decisions are neither judicial nor quasi-judicial \u2013 If reasons are to be given at every stage, then thecommercial activities of the State would come to a grinding halt \u2013The State must be given sufficient leeway in this regard \u2013 Constitutionof India \u2013 Art.12."
