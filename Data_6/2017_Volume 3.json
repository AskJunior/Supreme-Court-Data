Doctrines/Principles - Doctrine of lis pendens - Execution of sale deed dated 23.11.1959 by defendant no.1 in favour of purchase1; if affected by doctrine of lis pendens - Held: Partition suit had not been dismissed at all in the eyes of law - lt is to be treated as pending only ~ No legal fiction can be created that the suit itself had been dismissed 011 15.12.1955 due to non-payment of G costs for restoration; whereas ii was not dismissed at all - High Court also held that the order dated 1.12.1955 dismissiizg suit for non-payment of cost, was without jurisdiction - Suit was pending and wrongly treated as dismissed - Thus, the sale deed was executed during lis pendens. Trans.fer of Property Act, 1882: s. 52 - Trans.fer of property pending suit relating thereto - s. 52, if renders a trans.fer pendente lile void - Held: Doctrine o.f lis pendens does not affect the conveyance by a party to the suit but only renders it subservient to the rights of other parties to the litiga1io11 - Thus, s. 52 will not render a transaction void - On facts. sale deed not void but only valid to the extent of the share o.f vendor of BM which has been found in the preliminmy decree and affirmed in the final decree. s. 52 - Execution of sale deed during pendency of suit - Owners son sold his share as also share of other co-share - Necessity of filing suit for cancellation of sale deed - Held: Not necessary - Provisions of s. 52 prevent multiplicity of the proceedings - When sale deed had been executed during the pendency of suit the purchaser pendente lite is bound by the outcome of the suit - Vendor had no authority to sell land of other co-sharers - He had right to alienate his own share only - As such the right, title and interest of BM were subject to the pending suit for partition in which a preliininary decree was passed.

Adverse possession: Plea of - Suit for partition - During pendency, execution of sale deed by owners son in favour of BM - 1.f BM, his heirs and purchasers perfected their right, title and interest by virtue of adverse possession - Held: in an earlier suit plea of adverse possession had been negative - Sale deed was hit by the doctrine of /is pendens, the purchasers were bound by the result of the suit - s: 52 negates the very plea of adverse possession - Thus, there was no question of perfecting the .title by adverse possession during pendency of suit - High Court erred in law in holding that the plaintiffs perfected their title by virtue of adverse possession. Adverse possession - Plea ~ Requirements of - Held: Three requirements of plea of adverse possession i.e. '\"nee vi, nee clam, nee preeario\" i.e., peaceful, open and continuous - A1erely a bald statement .that the1\u00b7e was adverse possession is not enough to set up the plea - It has t'\"; be clearly set out from which date it commenced, and became hostile when there was repudiation of the title. Muslim law - Nature of succession - Co-sharer, a Muslim, alienating share of other co-sharers in the disputed property - Legality of - Held: Sale by co-sharer is not of undivided share but that of a specific property in which he had only specific share - Thus , being a tenant-in-common he. had no authority or right to sell the share of other co-owners - Vendor had the right to sell to the extent of his own share considering the nature of succession amongst Mohammedans and sale beyond his specific share was void - Thus, the sale of property of other co-sharers was illegal and void. Equity - Suit for partition - Claim of equity by purchaser for allotment of property in final decree proceedings - Held: It was open to the executing court lo adjust equity of purchasers to the permissible extent as purchasers pendente lite can work out the equities in accordance with law in the final decree proceedings - Though purchasers can work out the equity in the final decree proceedings but it is only to the legalZy permissible extent and not beyond that - Preliminary decree declared the shares in the property in specified shares - Preliminary decree is binding and even otherwise the sale was valid only to the extent of the share of vendor - Thus, by no equitable principle the purchaser can claim the entire .. property to be allotted to him - Also as per the Mohammedan Law sale beyond the extent of the share of vendor was void. Legal necessity- Sale of properly, whether for legal necessity, and thus, binding - Execution of sale deed during pendency of suit  - Owners son sold his share as also share of other co-share - Held: Recital of sale deed makes it clear that the sale was effected by the co-sharer for his 'personal necessity' - He had not executed the sale deed for payment of land revenue as its recital is otherwise which would prevail - Nor the sale deed had been executed in the fiduciary capacity acting on behalf of co-sharers - Even otherwise under the Mohammedan Law. it was not open to co-sharer to act in fiduciary capacity to sell the property and bind shares of others.

Death sentence - Plea of review petitioner that in the light of principles laid down in Bachan Singh, mitigating factors\u00b7 ought to F have been taken into account and that proper and effective hearing in that regard was not extended to the petitioner - Held: Plea not sustainable - Jn Bachan Singh case, the burden was\u00b7upon the State in respect of conditions (3) and (4) i.e. the probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would  constitute a continuing threat to society and the probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated - It was stated therein that the State shall by evidence prove that the accused did not satisfy these two conditions - However, in the subsequent paragraphs it was mentioned that those circumstances would certainly be relevant and great weight be attached to them but it was the cumulative effect of mitigating circumstances on one hand and aggravating facts on the other, which would be weighed to come to the final conclusion whether the case satisfied the requirement of being \"rarest of rare\" - Therefore, the correct interpretation of Bachan Singh case is that mere failure on part of the State to lead such evidence would not clinch the issue in favour of the accused - It is a relevant  consideration which will be weighed by the Court together with other circumstances on record. Death sentence - Aggravating and mitigating circumstances - Both aspects have to be given their respective weightage - The court has to strike a balance between the two and see towards which side scale of justice tilts - The material placed on record showed that after the judgment under review, the petitioner completed Bachelors Preparatory Programme offered by the Indira Gandhi National Open University enabling him to prepare for Bachelor level study and that he has also completed the Gandhi Vichar Pariksha and had participated in drawing competition - Jail record of the petitioner  was without any blemish and it was projected that there was a possibility of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated - However, the aggravating circumstances namely the extreme depravity and the barbaric manner in which the crime was. committed and the fact that the victim was a helpless girl of four years clearly outweigh the mitigating circumstances brought on record - No case made out to take a different view in the matter. Code ,of Criminal Procedure, 1973 - s.235(2) - Scope of - Plea of review petitioner that the judgment of conviction and the - order of sentence was passed by trial court on the same day which was opposed to the spirit of s.235(2) - Held: The purpose of s.235(2)  is to give sufficient time to the accused or the prosecution on the question of sentence to show the grounds on which the prosecution may plead or accused may show that the maximum sentence of death may be the appropriate sentence or the minimum sentence of life imprisonment may be awarded as the case may be - However, merely  because no separate date was given for hearing on sentence, the \u00b7 entire exercise is not vitiated - Plea rejected - Sentence/Sentencing.
