While hearing a PIL instituted by the District Bar Association for construction of a District Court Complex, the High Court took note of an application filed by the daily rated workers engaged in the High Court and passed an interim order observing that the State is duty bound to consider claim of the daily rated workers and as \"one time exception\" regularize their services. SLP filed by the State government against the interim order was dismissed. Subsequently, the High Court issued a further direction in which notice was taken of the fact that the State government had, over a considerable.period of time, failed to create therequired number of posts for the State judiciary. The High Court took the view that following the dismissal of the said SLP, the State was duty \u00b7 bound to create posts for the absorption of daily rated workers."
