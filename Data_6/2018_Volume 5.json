Investigation: Role of Investigating authority \u2013 The investigative authority has a responsibility to investigate in a fair manner and elicit truth \u2013 The concerned authorities to take up the investigation in a neutral manner, without having regards to the ultimate result. Criminal law: Injuries on the accused \u2013 A duty is cast on the prosecution to furnish proper explanation to the Court how the person who has been accused of assaulting the victim received injuries on his person in the same occurrence \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss.302 and 324. Criminal law: Motive \u2013 Generally, in case prosecution desires to place motive of the accused as a circumstance, like any other incriminating circumstance, it should also be fully established \u2013 If the genesis of the motive of the occurrence is not proved, the ocular testimony of the witnesses as to the occurrence could not be discarded only on the ground of absence of motive, if otherwise the evidence is worthy of reliance \u2013 Evidence."

        "HeadNote": "Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) \u2013 Grievance of debtor was that after the creditor issued the notice under s.13(2), the debtor made a representation asking for a reschedulement of the loan which the creditor neither considered nor communicated the reasons for non-acceptance thereof \u2013 Whether recovery proceedings were in breach of s.13(3A) for failure of the creditor to reply to the representation of the debtor and for want of a reasoned order \u2013 Held: s.13(4) envisages that if debt is classified as NPA, the creditor may by notice in writing require the debtor to discharge his liabilities within 60 days \u2013 After that debtor may make a representation and creditor is then bound to consider the representation and communicate the reasons for non-acceptance of representation within 15 days \u2013 When debtor fails to discharge his liability in full, the creditor may take any of the actions under sub-section (4) which include taking over the possession of secured assets \u2013 In the instant case, the creditor was induced by the debtor not to take action against them through assurances and promises \u2013 The creditor entered into negotiations for the settlement of the dues and even accepted cheques in repayment much after the notice under s.13(2) and after the debtor\u2019s letter of representation \u2013 Many opportunities were granted by the creditor to the debtor to repay the debt which were all met by proposals for extension of time \u2013 The debtor ignored the symbolic possession taken over by the creditor and continued to negotiate and even gave six cheques which were dishonoured \u2013 The debtor then gave a final letter of undertaking agreeing that the creditor could take over possession of the assets if the debt was not repaid \u2013 All along, the debtor\u2019s response has been that of seeking extension of time to pay, with the usual unfulfilled promise of repayment \u2013 In the fact and circumstances of this case, the debtor is not entitled to the discretionary relief under Art.226 of the Constitution which is indeed an equitable relief \u2013 Equity \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 226. Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(3A) \u2013 Purpose of introduction of s.13(3A) \u2013 Held: s.13(3A) was introduced with a plain intention to introduce a pause for the creditor to rethink and reconsider the action proposed by the debtor. Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s. 13(3A) \u2013 Whether s.13(3A) is mandatory or directory in nature \u2013 There is no doubt that if a reply with reasons is an integral and indispensable part of the statutory scheme, the Courts would not excuse a departure from it \u2013 But, on the other hand, if the reply is merely a direction and not of substance to the scheme, the non-compliance may be excused \u2013 The language of sub-section (3A) is clearly impulsive \u2013 It states that the secured creditor \u201cshall consider such representation or objection and further, if such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable, he shall communicate the reasons for non\u0002acceptance\u201d thereof \u2013 There is no reason to marginalize or dilute the impact of the use of the imperative \u2018shall\u2019 by reading it as \u2018may\u2019 \u2013 The word \u2018shall\u2019 invariably raises a presumption that the particular provision is imperative \u2013 However, in the instant case, failure to furnish a reply to the representation is not of much significance since the creditor undoubtedly considered the representation and the proposal for repayment made therein and in fact granted sufficient opportunity and time to the debtor to repay the debt without any avail \u2013 Therefore, in the fact and circumstances of this case, the debtor is not entitled to the discretionary relief \u2013 Interpretation of statutes. Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s. 31(i) \u2013 Plea of debtor that portion of land mortgaged by debtor as security interest consisted of agricultural land to which s. 31(i) does not apply and, therefore, land could not be recovered \u2013 Tenability of \u2013 Held: s.31(i) is intended to protect agricultural land held for agricultural purposes by agriculturists from the extraordinary provisions of this Act, which provides for enforcement of security interest without intervention of the Court \u2013 The plain intention of the provision is to exempt agricultural land from the provisions of the Act \u2013 In other words, the creditor cannot enforce any security interest created in his favour without intervention of the Court or Tribunal, if such security interest is in respect of agricultural land \u2013 The exemption thus protects agriculturists from losing their source of livelihood and income i.e. the agricultural land, under the drastic provision of the Act \u2013 In the instant case, security interest was created in respect of several parcels of land, which were meant to be a part of single unit i.e. the five star hotel in Goa \u2013 Some parcels of land claimed as agricultural land were apparently purchased by the debtor from agriculturists and were entered as agricultural lands in the revenue records \u2013 The debtor applied to the revenue authorities for the conversion of these lands to non-agricultural lands which is pending till date due to policy decision \u2013 The land in question is not an agricultural land \u2013 The High Court mis-directed itself in holding that the land was an agricultural land merely because it stood as such in the revenue entries, even though the application made for such conversation lies pending till date. Interpretation of statutes: Mandatory provision \u2013 A provision which requires reasons to be furnished must be considered as mandatory \u2013 Such a provision is an integral part of the duty to act fairly and reasonably and not fancifully. Constitution of India: Plea that s.31(i) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 is beyond the legislative competence of Parliament \u2013 Held: The validity of s.31(i) which deals with security interest created over agricultural land is an integral part of the Act and cannot be questioned on the ground of legislative competence. Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.14 \u2013 Whether the creditor could maintain an application of possession under s.14 of the Act; even though it had taken over only symbolic possession before the sale of the property to the auction purchaser \u2013 Held: In the instant case, the creditor did not have actual possession of the secured asset but only a constructive or symbolic possession \u2013 The transfer of the secured asset by the creditor, therefore, cannot be construed to be a complete transfer as contemplated by s.8 of the Transfer of Property Act \u2013 The creditor nevertheless had a right to take actual possession of the secured assets and must, therefore, be held to be a secured creditor even after the limited transfer to the auction purchaser under the agreement \u2013 Thus, the entire interest in the property not having been passed on to the creditor in the first place, the creditor in turn could not pass on the entire interest to the auction purchaser and thus remained a secured creditor in the Act. Fraud: Auction purchaser, allegation of collusion \u2013 Finding by High Court that there was fraud and collusion between the creditor and the auction purchaser based on fact that there was pending dispute between the parties and still he went ahead and made a bid for the property \u2013 Held: A risk of this kind taken up by an intending purchaser cannot lead to inference of collusion.

Rajasthan Rent Control Act, 2001 \u2013 Plea of respondent that there was non-compliance of Order dated 05.04.2014 as in the said order after six months from the order, the deposit was to be made three times of the rent \u2013 Held: Plea not sustainable \u2013 Order dated 05.04.2014 indicated that the direction was that if the tenant does not evacuate the premises within 6 months from the date of issue of certificate of re-possession, he shall be responsible to pay 3 times rent to the landlady \u2013 The order dated 05.04.2014 itself mentions that the liability to pay three times rent shall accrue after six months from the date of issue of certificate of re-possession \u2013 There is no material to indicate as to when certificate of re-possession was issued \u2013 Secondly, the order made by the Rent Tribunal as well as Rent Appellate Tribunal stood superseded by the order of the High Court dated 01.11.2017 which was passed with the consent of both the parties \u2013 High Court in its order dated 01.11.2017 recorded terms and conditions for permitting the appellant to continue in occupation of the premises in question till 30.04.2019 \u2013 The terms and conditions recorded in the order by the High Court are clearly in variance with the decree of the Rent Tribunal and the Rent Appellate Tribunal \u2013 What was required to be adhered to are the directions of the High Court dated 01.11.2017 and not the order of the Tribunal as claimed for the respondent \u2013 Appellant is directed to be put back in possession of the premises \u2013 The appellant shall continue to deposit the mesne profit as per order of the High Court dated 01.11.2017 and in the event of any default committed by the appellant, it shall be open for the respondent-landlady to take appropriate proceedings against the appellant."

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: s.166 \u2013 Quantum of compensation \u2013 The Tribunal noted the claim of the claimant-appellant that he was getting Rs.1500/- per month towards his salary and Rs.600/- per month towards food allowance from employer \u2013 The fact that the claimant had possessed heavy transport motor vehicle driving licence has not been doubted \u2013 The driving licence on record being valid for a limited period, cannot be the basis to belie the claim of the claimant duly supported by employer, that the claimant was employed by him on his new truck \u2013 Besides the said income, the claimant claimed to have earning of Rs.1000/- per month from farming fields \u2013 The Tribunal, however, pegged the loss of monthly income to the claimant at Rs.520/- per month while computing the compensation amount on the finding that there was no convincing evidence about complete non-employability of the claimant \u2013 Further, no provision was made by the Tribunal towards future prospects \u2013 The Tribunal, therefore, should have computed the loss of income on that basis \u2013 Additionally, the claimant because of amputation of his right leg would be forced to permanently use prosthetic leg during his life time \u2013 No provision was made by the Tribunal in that regard \u2013 On these heads, the claimant is certainly entitled for enhanced compensation \u2013 Taking the loss of monthly income due to permanent disability of 40%, the appellant is held entitled to Rs.2,25,792/- plus 40% future prospects \u2013 Besides, the amount quantified by the Tribunal towards the heads for medical treatment after the accident, motorcycle repair, mental and physical problem the appellant is additionally held entitled to medical expenses for procurement of a prosthetic leg, quantified at Rs.25,000/- . Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: s.166 \u2013 Liability of insurer to pay the compensation amount \u2013 Insurance company denied liability on the ground that no payment was received by the company towards the insurance premium as the cover note purportedly taken for the jeep in question was obtained from the then Development Officer, who was later on sacked by Insurance Company and, therefore, same was fraudulent \u2013 Held: Insurance company has been able to show that no insurance policy was issued in respect of the offending jeep \u2013 However, the claim of the driver and the owner of the offending jeep to the extent that they possessed a cover note issued by the then Development Officer of the Insurance Company is accepted coupled with the fact that the Cover Note was issued by the then Development Officer at a point of time when he was still working with Insurance Company \u2013 It must follow that the then Development Officer was acting on behalf of the Insurance Company, even though stricto sensu the Insurance Company may not be liable to pay any compensation as no insurance policy was issued in respect of the offending vehicle, much less a valid insurance policy \u2013 Therefore, to do substantial justice, principle of \u201cpay and recover\u201d is invoked \u2013 Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Principle of \u201cpay and recover\u201d."

Investigation: In number of case, investigations remain pending for unduly long time which is not conducive to administration of criminal justice \u2013 There is need for timelines for completing investigation and for having in-house oversight mechanism wherein accountability for adhering to laid down timelines can be fixed at a different levels in the hierarchy . Constitution of India \u2013 Art.21 \u2013 Speedy trial \u2013 There is implicit right under Art.21 for speedy trial which in turn encompasses speedy investigation, inquiry, appeal, revision and retrial \u2013 To determine whether undue delay has occurred, one must have regard to nature of offence, number of accused and witnesses, workload of the court and the investigating agency, systemic delays \u2013 Inordinate delay may be taken as presumptive proof of prejudice particularly when accused is in custody so that prosecution does not become persecution \u2013 Court has to balance and weigh several relevant factors \u2013 Though it is neither advisable nor feasible to prescribe any mandatory outer time limit and the court may only examine effect of delay in every individual case on the anvil of Art. 21 of the Constitution, there is certainly a need for in-house mechanism to ensure that there is no undue delay in completing investigation \u2013 Delay/laches \u2013 Investigation."

Regn 2(e)(ii), 2(h)(ix) \u2013 Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) \u2013 Satyam scam \u2013 Appellant Company-private company of the executive director/non-director of SCSL and his wife \u2013 Each holding 50% share capital of the company \u2013 Appellant sold only 8,00,000 shares held in SCSL \u2013 24,00,000 shares never sold by appellant, but for which only application money was received and returned by 17.4.2002 \u2013 Disgorgement order included gains made on account of the said shares \u2013 Minority judgment holding that 8,00,000 shares had been sold prior to the occurrence of the UPSI and 24,00,000 shares were never sold but were merely returned to executive director/non-director of SCSL, could not form the basis of any disgorgement order \u2013 On appeal, held: Minority judgment is upheld \u2013 Appellant does not have persons who are relatives of persons mentioned in sub-clauses (vi), (vii) and (viii) \u2013 Under these sub-clauses, a person is deemed to be a connected person if such person is a relative of persons in cl (i) to (v); or is a banker of the company; or is a relative of a connected person \u2013 Since none of these clauses are attracted, s. 2(h)(ix) not attracted. Regn 2(h)(viii) \u2013 Person deemed to be connected \u2013 Satyam scam \u2013 Father of executive director/non-executive director of the company \u2013 Father neither a promoter nor a director of SCSL, and sold 2,50,000 shares in 2005 and expired in 2007 \u2013 Order by the tribunal that father was a person deemed to be connected under Regn 2(h)(viii) since he was relative of a connected person \u2013 On appeal, held: Director/executive director ceased to be a connected person in 2003 \u2013 Thus, when the father sold shares in 2005, he could not be a deemed to be connected person since the director himself ceased to be a connected person \u2013 Thus, order of Whole Time Member quashed and set aside. Regn 2(e)(i) \u2013 Insider \u2013 Connected person \u2013 Satyam scam \u2013 Mother of the Chairman, though relative, yet made off market transactions way back in 2003 \u2013 Whole time member and majority judgment of the appellate tribunal holding that mother being the close relative, thus, must be presumed that she had access to UPSI \u2013 On appeal, held: CBI or the Enforcement Directorate did not proceed against the mother nor was referred to by the SFIO\u2019s report \u2013 She was neither promoter nor director of SCSL \u2013 Thus, the test of the second part of clause 2(e)(i) not met with \u2013 Furthermore, had she been in possession of UPSI, she would also have sold shares at their peak price instead of selling them at a depressed price in 2003 \u2013 Thus, the majority judgment set aside. Regn 2(e)(i) \u2013 Insider \u2013 Satyam scam \u2013 Chairman\u2019s sons roped in by the Whole time member and the appellate tribunal \u2013 On appeal, held: Second limb of clause 2(e)(i) cannot be put against either of the sons \u2013 There was no evidence of any complicity in the fraud committed by their father \u2013 Given the fact that they were expressly exonerated of the said fraud by the appellate tribunal, and that they were running independent businesses and were neither directors nor promoters of SCSL, and that they sold their shares for business purposes at a price much less than the peak price at which their father sold shares of SCSL in 2006, no case made out against them. Regn 2(h)(ix) \u2013 Insider \u2013 Person deemed to be connected person \u2013 Satyam scam \u2013 Appellant-private limited company owned shares of Satyam company which were pledged as security for obtaining a loan amount, that was borrowed to provide funds to ten independent companies, owned by the family of the Chairman \u2013 Majority judgment of the appellate tribunal held the appellant company as deemed to be a connected person u/Regn 2(h)(ix) \u2013 On appeal, held: Shareholding pattern of the appellant company, made it clear that Chairman and his brother individually held more than 10% interest in the appellant company, thus, the appellant company is deemed to be a connected person u/Regn 2(h)(ix) \u2013 Further, the appellant company was an \u2018insider\u2019 under the Regulations \u2013 It had pledged and got the shares of Satyam belonging to the Chairman and his brother and their spouses sold when in possession of UPSI and thus, violated SEBI Act and the Regulations \u2013 Thus, the finding of the majority judgment upheld. Regn 2(e)(i) and (ii) \u2013 Insider trading \u2013 Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (UPSI) \u2013 Satyam scam \u2013 Appellant-younger brother of the Chairman, roped in by the appellate tribunal \u2013 On appeal, held: From s. 246 it is clear that the SFIO\u2019s report can be used as evidence in any other proceeding \u2013 By virtue of s. 246, it is possible to appreciate the role of the appellant in the so-called Satyam scam \u2013 Also, the judgment of the Special Court, delivered long after the show cause notice, proved that the appellant also played active role in the criminal conspiracy and cheating of SCSL, its share holders and investors \u2013 While it is true that adjudication proceedings and criminal proceedings are separate proceedings, the relevance of the Special Court\u2019s judgment is only for the purpose of showing that the second part of the definition of an \u201cinsider\u201d is made out in the appellant\u2019s case \u2013 He was reasonably expected to have access to UPSI in respect of the securities of SCSL \u2013 Thus, SFIO\u2019s report as well as the Special court judgment clearly and unmistakably points to the complicity of appellant, unlike that of the other family members, in the fraud committed \u2013 Majority judgment of the appellate tribunal upheld \u2013 Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 s. 246."
