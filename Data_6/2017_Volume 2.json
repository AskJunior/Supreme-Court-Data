I 42 - Scam.Constitution of India: Art.142 - Mass fraud - Admission obtained by fraud - Invocation of Art. I 42, to do complete justice, determiningparameters - Held: The /ll'o important parameters for consideration are, \"larger interest of administration oj justice\", and \"preventing manifest injustice\" - The facts and circumstances of the instant case do not reveal the existence. of either of these two factors - With Vyapam having cancelled the appellants' admission lo the MBBS course, and the said orders having been upheld by the High Court, as well as, by this Court, ii cannot be said that the cancellation orders were unjust - If the admission of the appellants to the MBBS course, was improper, the cancellation orders, were obviously proper - If the academic benefits of the appellants, arising out of their admission cancelled by Vyapam are restored, tht cancellation orders would be set at naught - That would not serve the \"larger interest of administration of justice\" - On the contrary, such an initiative would cause \"manifest injustice\" - It is, therefore, not possible in the facts of the instant case to invoke Art. 142 of the Constitution in the larger interest of the administration of justice - It is also not possible to accept, that any manifest injustice would be done to the appellants, if their admissions are cancelled - Scam. Art. I 42 - Exercise of power u/Art. I 42 to do complete ;us/ice - Connotation of words \"complete justice\"- Held: The words \"complete justice\" used in Art.142 would not include the power, to disregard even statutory provisions, and/or a declared pronouncement of law under Art.141, even in exceptional circumstances - Debates and deliberations in Parliament, leading to a valid legislation, represent the will of the majority- It is difficult, to visualize a situation, wherein a valid legislation, would render injustice to the parties, or would lead to a situation of incomplete ;ustice for one or the other party - In view of the conscious involvement of the appellants in gaining admission to the MBBS course, by means of a fraudulent stratagem of trickery, the declaration of law with reference to fraud cannot be ignored or overlooked - Nothing obtained by fraud, can be sustained - This declaredproposition of law, must apply to the case of the appellants, as well. Art. I 42 - Admission obtained by fraud - Invocation of Art. 142 on plea of being young and immature - The submission of appellants was that they should not be identified, as a part of the syndicate, engaged in manipulating their admissions, even thoughthey were the beneficiaries thereof and that they were young, and A not mature enough to understand the consequences of their actions - These submissions are outrightly rejected - Even a juvenile wrongdoer faces trial and is subjected to statutory consequences - The appellants in this case, irrespective of their age, were conscious of the regular process of admission - They breached the same by B devious means - They must therefore, suffer the consequences of their actions - Each one of the appellants, was aware of the fact, that their admission to the MBBS course, would be determined 011 the basis of their performance in the Pre-Medical Test - Rather than appearing in the qualifying test 011 their own, they chose to seek assistance of meritorious students, to garner higher marks - c Probably, the appellants were sure, that they would not be able to gain admission to the MBBS' course, on their own merit - That is why, they had to strategize their admission to the MBBS cour~e - Therefore, the contention that the appellants were\u00b7 meritorious students, and as such, their admission to the MBBS course, deserved D to be preserved is rejected -In that view of the matter, relief wArt.142 not granted - Appellants had consciously sought the assistance of a syndicate, engaged in manipulating admissions to medical institutions - They were beneficiaries of acts of deceit and deception - In that view of the matter, the case of the appellants does not commend, as a matter deserving of any sympathetic E consideration. Art.142 - Jurisdiction 1inder, scope - Held: The jurisdiction exercisable u!Art.14:;- cannot ever be invoked, to salvage, and legitimize acts of fraudulent character - Fraud, cannot be allowed to trounce, on thi stratagem of public good - The issue in hand, has an infinitely vast dimension - If immediate social or societal gains is kept in mind, the perspective. of consideration would be different - The basic fundamental right of equality before law and equal protection of the laws, is extended to citizens and non-citizens alike, through Art.14 on the fountainhead of fairness - The actions of the appellants, are founded on unacceptable behaviour, and in complete breach of the rule of law - Their actions, constitute acts of deceit, invading into a righteous social order - National character cannot be sacrificed for benefits, individual or societal - In the facts and circumstances of the case in hand, it would not be proper to legitimize the admission of the appellants, to the MBBS course, F Gn exercise of the jurisdiction vested in this Court u/Art.1./2 of the Constitution. Administration of Justice - Fair play and equity - Nothing, obtained by fraud, can be sustained; as fraud unravels everything - No person can be allowed to keep an advantage he has obtained by fraud - Where two options are open to a Court, and both are equally beckoning, it would be most prudent to choose the one, which is founded on truth and honesty, and the one which is founded on fair play and legitimacy - Siding with the option founded on the deceit or fraud, or on favour as opposed to merit, or by avoiding the postulated due process, would be imprudent - In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, there was absolutely no cause to legitimize the admissions of the appellants to the MBBS course, since the same clearly fell in the imprudent category."

W 1 is the brother of the deceased - The testimony of this witness did not shake in any material particulars in the cross-examination - His testimony was credible and it proved that the accused shot the deceased as alleged by the prosecution - The ballistics report stated that the empty cartridges found ot the scene of the crime were not fired from the gun recovered from the accused - But this had no bearing on the credibility of the deposition of P. W 1 that the accused shot the deceased with a gun, particularly as it was corroborated by the bullets in the body - The fact that accused shot the deceased with a gun was also corroborated by the testimony of P. W2 - Plea of false implication was also ruled out - The facts and circumstances of the case warranted interference with the acquittal order - Respondent convicted u!s.302 and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment."

Central Excise Rules. 1944 - rr. 96ZP(3) and 96Z0(3) - Whether an assessee who chooses once to pay duty in terms of r. 96ZP(3) can be compelled to pay duty calculated in accordance with the said rule for all times to come without any regard to actual production - Department relied on Venus Castings and Supre~1e Steel case rendered by Supreme Court to stale that the assessee who makes a choice once to avail the scheme under r. 96ZP(3) cannot go beyond his choice - However, in both these cases, Supreme Court was dealing with 1: 96Z0(3) - In Venus Castings, a r~ference was made to r. 96ZP and it was observed that r. 96ZO and 1: 96ZP provide for procedure to be followed by the mamifacll/rer of ingots and billets and hot re-rolled products and the scheme envisaged tlv1t these provisions was identical - Held: There are broad similarities between these rules but they are not identical - The only similarity between r. 96Z0(3) and r. 96ZP(3) is that both the Rules seek to eliminate the benefit of the procedure u!s.3A(4) of the Act in cases of those assessees who choose to opt for levy and collection of excise duty in accordance with the sub-rules (3) which are exceptions to the general Rules of levy and collection of duties provided u/n: 96ZO and 96ZP - Therefore, it is difficult to accept the submission of the Department that the issue is covered by the judgments of t/:is Court rendered in Venus Castings and Supreme Steels - These two ;udgments require a ji1rther examination - Apart from that, these ;udgments did not deal with vires of r. 96ZP(3} - However. in view of the fact that Supreme Steels is a decision rendered by a Bench of three Judges, it is deemed appropriate that the question of law be settled by a Bench of an appropriate strength - Matter referred to larger bench - Hot re-rolling Steel Mills Annual Capacity Determination Rules, 1997 - 1:5 - Central Excise Act, 1944 -s. 3A - Reference to larger bench.

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860 - ss.302134 - Murder - Prosecution case was that on the fateful day, the accused persons demanded return of their money from the neighbour of the victim-deceased - Deceased requested !hem lo waive off the amount and due to /hat altercation took place between the deceased and the two accused - After half an hour the accused persons came back on scooter and therqilfter deceased also left with them but on his separate ~'coater - Tliereafter, deceased did not return and next day his dead body was found in an open ground - Trial court relying upon the testimony of chance witnesses held both the accused guilty u/ss.302134 - High Court affirmed conviction - On appeal, held: It is not clear from the record as to how these chance witnesses, who stated that they heard altercation between the deceased amf Jhe two accused after midnight and thereafter heard sound of fire, were present at the spot - The testimony of these witnesses could\u00b7not be said to be reliable or trustworthy particularly when their statements were not corroborated from other evidence on record - In view of the conclusion of the Forensic Science Laboratory that the firing mechanism of the country-made pistol was not in working order and no opinion could be formed regarding the linkage of the pistol with the crime in question, the prosecution story, as narrated by chance witnesses was highly doubtful - Apart from this, though the motive of crime is not necessarily required to be proved, but in the case like the present one where the appellants are named 011 suspicion by informant, the motive appears to be relevant fact - Informant simply mentioned that the deceased had asked the two accused to waive of the remaining amount of ( 2501- from the loan of ( 10,0001- taken by his neighbour but the same would not appear to be a convincing motive to commit the crime by the accused - The said neighbour was not examined by prosecution - Even otherwise, in the FIR it was nowhere mentioned why actually deceased had gone in his separate scooter with the two accused from his house - Prosecutionailed to prove the charge of offence punishable u/ss.302134 against the two accused - Both the accused are acquitted of the charges.\u00b7"
