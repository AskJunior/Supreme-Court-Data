Justification - Held: On facts, not justified -There was no breach of any mandatory requirement in the procedure \u00b7..: Environmental clearance was granted in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Environment D Impact Assessment (EIA) notification dated 27.01.1994 well before issuance of the notification dated 10.04.1997 providing for mandatory public hearing - Consequently, the High Court could not have allowed the writ petitions challenging the environmental clearances on the ground that no public E hearing was conducted before grant of the environmental clearances - So long as the statutory process is followed and the EIA made by the authorities concerned is not found to be irrational so as to frustrate the very purpose of EIA, the Court will not interfere with the decision of the authorities in exercise F of its powers of judicial review.
