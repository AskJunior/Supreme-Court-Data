Evidence \u2013 Possible visibility of accused \u2013 Relevance of \u2013 Murder case \u2013 Three PWs deposed to have seen the accused persons at the same location while running away from the place of occurrence \u2013 Held: Evidence on whether that location was visible from the spots PWs were at the material point of time, cannot be discarded as being irrelevant. Evidence \u2013 Res Gestae \u2013 Murder case \u2013 Three PWs deposed to have seen accused-appellant and the co-accused at the same location while running away from the place of occurrence \u2013 Held: On facts, even if the two accused persons were so seen by the PWs, that would be too thin a piece of evidence to convict appellant u/ s.302 IPC applying the principle of \u2018res gestae\u2019 \u2013 Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Principle of \u2018res gestae\u2019 \u2013 IPC \u2013 s.302.

Evidence Act, 1872: s. 32 - Dying declaration \u2013 Evidentiary value of \u2013 Sustenance of conviction solely based thereon \u2013 Held: When the dying declaration has been recorded in accordance with law, and it gives a cogent and plausible explanation of the occurrence, it can be relied upon as the solitary piece of evidence to convict the accused \u2013 Dying declaration is admitted in evidence on the premise that the anticipation of brewing death breeds the same human feelings as that of a conscientious and guiltless person under oath \u2013 It is the last words of a person which are presumed to be truthful, and not infected by any motive or malice \u2013 Thus, the dying declaration is admissible in evidence on the principle of necessity as there is very little hope of survival of the maker, and if found reliable, it can certainly form the basis for conviction. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s. 378 \u2013 Appeal in case of acquittal \u2013 Exercise of power by High Court u/s. 378 \u2013 Held: Power of scrutiny exercisable by the High Court u/s. 378 should not be routinely invoked where the view formed by the trial court was a \u2018possible view\u2019 \u2013 Unless the High Court finds that there is complete misreading of the material evidence which has led to miscarriage of justice, the view taken by the trial court which can also possibly be a correct view, need not be interfered with \u2013 This self-restraint doctrine, certainly, does not denude the High Court of its powers to re-appreciate the evidence, including in an appeal against acquittal and arrive at a different finding of fact."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Remedies open to an accused in the case of remand under s.167 \u2013 Held: An order under s.167 is purely an interlocutory order \u2013 No revision is maintainable \u2013 A petition under s.482 cannot be ruled out \u2013 When a person arrested in a non-bailable offence is in custody, subject to the restrictions, contained therein, a court other than High Court or Court of Session, before whom he is brought inter alia, can release him on bail under s.437 \u2013 s.439 deals with special powers of High Court and court of session to grant bail to a person in custody \u2013 The said courts may also set aside or modify any condition in an order by a Magistrate \u2013 Ordinarily, when the court considers a request for remand there would be an application for bail \u2013 It is for the court to grant bail failing which an order of remand would follow.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.437, 439 \u2013 While the remand report is considered by the Magistrate the application for bail may be moved under s.439 instead of moving under s.437 in view of the restrictions contained therein \u2013 Though an application under s.397 would not lie against the remand, an application for bail would lie under s.439 \u2013 Therefore, ordinarily the accused would seek bail and legality and the need for remand would also be considered by the High Court or court of session in an application under s.439 \u2013 No doubt the additional restrictions under s.43(D)(5) of UAPA are applicable to citizens of India in cases under the said law. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Whether a Writ of Habeas Corpus lies against an order of remand under s.167 of the Code \u2013 A Habeas Corpus petition is one seeking redress in the case of illegal detention \u2013 It is intended to be a most expeditious remedy as liberty is at stake \u2013 If the remand is absolutely illegal or the remand is afflicted with the vice of lack of jurisdiction, a Habeas Corpus petition would indeed lie \u2013 Equally, if an order of remand is passed in an absolutely mechanical manner, the person affected can seek the remedy of Habeas Corpus \u2013 Barring such situations, a Habeas Corpus petition will not lie. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: ss.167, 439 \u2013 Whether superior courts (including High Court) can exercise power under s.167 of the Code \u2013 Can broken periods of custody count for the purpose of default bail \u2013 Though the power is vested with the Magistrate to order remand by way, of appropriate jurisdiction exercised by the superior Courts, (it would, in fact, include the Court of Sessions acting under s.439) the power under s.167 could also be exercised by Courts which are superior to the Magistrate \u2013 While ordinarily, the Magistrate is the original Court which would exercise power to remand under s.167, the exercise of power by the superior Courts which would result in custody being ordered ordinarily (police or judicial custody) by the superior Courts which includes the High Court, would indeed be the custody for the purpose of calculating the period within which the charge sheet must be filed, failing with the accused acquires the statutory right to default bail \u2013 In such circumstances, broken periods of custody can be counted whether custody is suffered by the order of the Magistrate or superior courts, if investigation remains incomplete after the custody, whether continuous or broken periods pieced together reaches the requisite period; default bail becomes the right of the detained person. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Transit order, effect of \u2013 The remand pursuant to a transit remand cannot be judicial custody as the police is exclusively entrusted with the man to produce him before the Magistrate having jurisdiction \u2013 It is therefore, police custody \u2013 If it is thought that during the journey, it is impermissible to interrogate the accused on the basis of transit order, then such interrogation would equally be impermissible during the time of journey permitted without obtaining an order under s.167 \u2013 If also during such journey, the accused volunteers with a statement otherwise falling under s.27 of Evidence Act, it would be one when the accused is in the custody of the police \u2013 If it is police custody then, the order of the Magistrate granting transit remand would set the clock ticking to complete the period for the purpose of default bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.428 \u2013 Period of detention, set off of \u2013 Held: s.428 enables a person convicted to have the period of detention which he has undergone during the investigation, enquiry or trial set off against the term of imprisonment. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Detention of an accused \u2013 Police officer can detain accused and question him in the course of the investigation \u2013 However, the officer cannot detain the accused beyond 24 hours excluding the time taken for the journey from the place of arrest to the place where the Magistrate who is competent to try the case sits \u2013 If he cannot so produce the accused and the investigation is incomplete, the officer is duty bound to produce the arrested person before the nearest Magistrate \u2013 The nearest Magistrate may or may not have jurisdiction \u2013 He may order the continued detention of the arrested person based on the request for remand \u2013 He would largely rely on the entries in the case diary and on being satisfied of the need for such remand which must be manifested by reasons \u2013 The Magistrate can order police custodyduring the first 15 days (in cases under UAPA, the first 30 days) \u2013 Beyond such period, the Magistrate may direct detention which is described as judicial custody or such other custody as he may think fit \u2013 It is, no doubt, open to a Magistrate to refuse police custody completely during the first 15 days \u2013 He may give police custody during the first 15 days not in one go but in instalments \u2013 It is also open to the Magistrate to release the arrested person on bail \u2013 The scheme further under s.167 is that custody (detention/ custody) as authorized under such provisions, if it exceeds the limit as to maximum period without the charge sheet being filed, entitles the person in detention to be released on default bail \u2013 In fact, the person may on account of his inability to offer the bail languish in custody but he would undoubtedly be entitled to count the entire period he has spent in detention under orders of the Magistrate/ Superior Court exercising powers under s.167 for the purpose of set off under s.428. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Effect of illegality in the order under s.167 \u2013 An order purports to remand a person under s.167 \u2013 It is made without complying with mandatory requirements thereunder \u2013 It results in actual custody \u2013 The period of custody will count towards default bail. s.167(3) mandates reasons be recorded if police custody is ordered \u2013 There has to be application of mind \u2013 If there is complete non-application of mind or reasons are not recorded, while it may render the exercise illegal and liable to be interfered with, the actual detention undergone under the order, will certainly count towards default bail \u2013 Likewise, unlike the previous Code (1898), the present Code mandates the production of the accused before the Magistrate as provided in clause (b) of the proviso to s.167(2) \u2013 Custody ordered without complying with the said provision, may be illegal \u2013 But actual custody undergone will again count towards default bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 If the Court purports to invoke and act under s.167, the detention will qualify even if there is illegality in the passing of the order \u2013 What matter in such cases is the actual custody \u2013 However, when the Court does not purport to act under s.167, then the detention involved pursuant to the order of the Court cannot qualify as detention under s.167.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Judicial custody and police custody \u2013 Difference between \u2013 When a person is remanded to police custody, he passes into the exclusive custody of the police officers \u2013 \u2018Custodial Interrogation\u2019 as is indispensable to unearth the truth in a given case is the substantial premise for such custody \u2013 The Magistrate must undoubtedly be convinced about the need for remand to such custody \u2013 Reasons must be recorded \u2013 Judicial custody is ordinarily custody in a jail \u2013 It is referred to also as jail custody \u2013 The jails come under the Department of Jails and staffed by the employees of the said department \u2013 The person in jail custody is therefore indirectly, through the jail authorities, under the custody of the Court \u2013 The police officer does not have access to a person in judicial custody as he would have in the case of a person in police custody \u2013 Unless permission is sought and obtained which would apparently be subject to such conditions as a court places the person in judicial custody cannot be questioned by the police officers \u2013 Now in a case, ordinarily, instead of ordering a remand a person can be released on bail \u2013 As to whether a case is made out is a question to be decided in the facts of each case \u2013 There may be restrictions put in regard to the grant of bail by law which must be observed \u2013 But if bail is not granted then a person arrested by the police in connection with the cognizable offence must be remanded to custody \u2013 This is inevitable from the reading of s.167 of the Cr.P.C. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Judicial custody of accused \u2013 The concept of house arrest as ordered in this case with the complete prohibition on stepping out of the Appellants premises and the injunction against interacting with persons other than ordinary residents, and the standing of guard not to protect him but to enforce the condition would place the Appellant under judicial custody \u2013 s.167 speaks of \u2018such custody as it thinks fit\u2019 \u2013 If it is found ordered under s.167 it will count. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Does the magistrate/Court consider the legality of arrest/detention while acting under s.167 \u2013 Held: Art.22(1) creates a fundamental right on a person arrested to be not detained without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest \u2013 It also declares it afundamental right for the detained person to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice \u2013 Now, detention follows arrest \u2013 What Art.22(1) is concerned with is that the detention must be supported by the fulfilment of the rights referred to therein \u2013 Strictly speaking, therefore, Art.22(1) does not go to the legality of the arrest \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.22(1). Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.167 \u2013 Impact of non- accessibility to the appellant for the investigating agency during house arrest and the effect of the appellant being in police custody from 14.4.2020 to 25.4.2020 \u2013 The very purpose of custody under s.167 is to enable the police to interrogate the accused and if that opportunity is not present then such period of custody as alleged would not qualify for the purpose of s.167 \u2013 In other words, the argument appears to be that the object and scheme of s.167 is that an investigation is carried out with opportunity to question the accused and still it is not completed within the period of 90 days whereupon right to default bail arises \u2013 By the proceedings on 28.08.2018 when the petition was filed, the High Court stayed the transit remand and the appellant could not be taken to Maharashtra \u2013 By the very same order, the High Court placed the appellant under house arrest \u2013 No access was provided to the investigating agencies to question the appellant \u2013 In such circumstances, the period undergone as house arrest should be excluded. Prisons: Conditions relating to jails and prisoners \u2013 Alarming state of affairs as far as occupancy rate is concerned \u2013 Overcrowding in jails, discussed."

Arts. 19(1)(a), 19(2) \u2013 Freedom of expression of the Media \u2013 Reporting the proceedings of judicial institutions \u2013 Importance of \u2013 Held: Constitution guarantees the media the freedom to inform, to distill and convey information on all matters of interest \u2013 Freedom of speech and expression extends to reporting the proceedings of judicial institutions as well \u2013 Courts are entrusted to perform crucial functions under law which has direct impact not only on the rights of citizens, but also the extent to which the citizens can exact accountability from the executive \u2013 Therein lies the importance of freedom of the media to comment on and write about proceedings \u2013 Furthermore, media has over the years, transitioned from the predominance of newspapers to internet for disseminating news, views and ideas to audiences beyond national boundaries \u2013 This, would also include information reported about the functioning of courts \u2013 Hence, it would do no good to prevent the new forms of media from reporting judicial proceedings.Judiciary: Open Courts \u2013 Concept of \u2013 Held: Concept of open court requires that information relating to a court proceeding must be available in the public domain \u2013 Open access to courts is essential to safeguard valuable constitutional freedoms \u2013 Courts must be open both in the physical and metaphorical sense, save and except for in-camera proceedings in an exceptional category of cases \u2013 Open court proceeding ensures that the judicial process is subject to public scrutiny \u2013 Public scrutiny is crucial to maintaining transparency and accountability \u2013 There are multiple ways in which an open court system contributes to the working of democracy. Judicial accountability \u2013 Public Discourse and Media Reporting \u2013 Held: Rights of the media to report and disseminate issues and events, including court proceedings are a part of the public domain \u2013 This is not merely an aspect of protecting the rights of individuals and entities on reporting, but also a part of the process of augmenting the integrity of the judiciary and the cause of justice as a whole. Judicial conduct \u2013 Freedom and constraints of \u2013 Held: Independence of the judiciary translates to being impartial, free from bias and uninfluenced by the actions of those in power, but also recognizes the freedom to judges to conduct court proceedings within the contours of the principles of natural justice \u2013 Judges in the performance of their duty must remain faithful to the oath of the office they hold, which requires them to bear allegiance to the Constitution \u2013 An independent judiciary must also be one which is accountable to the public in its actions and omissions. Judicial restraint and discipline \u2013 Exercise of \u2013 Held: Power of judges must not be unbridled and judicial restraint must be exercised, before using strong and scathing language to criticize any individual or institution \u2013 This Court must strike a balance between reproaching the High Courts or lower courts unnecessarily, so as to not hamper their independent functioning \u2013 This Court must also intervene where judges have overstepped the mark and breached the norms of judicial propriety.."

Evidence Act, 1872: s.92 \u2013 Contract between parties \u2013 Reading of the contract showed that the appellant had intended to transfer business to respondent during the contractual period and the agreement was not meant as a lease or license for the respondent to conduct business \u2013 Respondent contended that the meaning of the document should not be culled solely with reference to the language used in the document, rather extrinsic evidence needs to be utilized before adducing proper meaning to the contract \u2013 Such contention is not accepted \u2013 s.92 specifically prohibits evidence of any oral agreement or statement which would contradict, vary, add to or subtract from its terms \u2013 If oral evidence could be received to show that the terms of the document were really different from those expressed therein, it would amount to according permission to give evidence to contradict or vary those terms and as such it comes within the inhibitions of s.92 \u2013 It could not be postulated that the legislature intended to nullify the object of s.92 by enacting exceptions to that section \u2013 Once the recitals and the contract were accepted, the respondent could not have adduced contrary extrinsic parole evidence, unless he portrayed ambiguity in the language \u2013 The evidence pointed that the license was created for continuation of existing business, rather than license/lease of shop premises \u2013 Once it is determined that the impugned agreement was a license for continuing existing business, Bombay Rent Act does not cover such arrangements \u2013 The jurisdiction of the trial court is accordingly not ousted \u2013 Rent Control and eviction."

Judicial review \u2013 Exercise of, over the management of the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 Held: Policy-making continues to be in the sole domain of the executive \u2013 However, separation of powers does not result in courts lacking jurisdiction in conducting a judicial review of these policies \u2013 Constitution does not envisage courts to be silent spectators when constitutional rights of citizens are infringed by executive policies \u2013 Judicial review and soliciting constitutional justification for policies formulated by the executive is an essential function, which the courts are entrusted to perform \u2013 Judiciary has also recognized that constitutional scrutiny is transformed during such public health emergencies \u2013 In grappling with the second wave of the pandemic, this Court does not intend to second-guess the wisdom of the executive \u2013 However, it continues to exercise jurisdiction to determine if the chosen policy measure conforms to the standards of reasonableness, militates against manifest arbitrariness and protects the right to life of all persons \u2013 Court is presently assuming a dialogic jurisdiction \u2013 Hence, the Court would, under the auspices of an open court judicial process, conduct deliberations with the executive where justifications for existing policies would be elicited and evaluated to assess whether they survive constitutional scrutiny.

        "HeadNote": "Contempt of Court: Civil contempt \u2013 It is well settled that contempt action ought to proceed only in respect of established wilful disobedience of the order of the Court \u2013 In the instant case, the limited direction given by the High Court and not disturbed by this Court was to permit the petitioners to work on the concerned posts and to pay them regular salary as and when the same accrues to them \u2013 Grievance of the petitioners in the first set of contempt petitions was that the respondents have appointed them afresh instead of reinstatement with continuity of service along with arrears of wages and thus have wilfully violated the direction of this Court \u2013 The expression used is only \u201cto permit the petitioners to work on the posts\u201d which were held by them at the time of their termination and \u201cto pay them regular salary month by month\u201d and \u201cas and when the same accrues to them\u201d \u2013 It is not a case of wilful disobedience of the orders of the Court. Contempt of Court: Civil contempt \u2013 The second set of contempt petitions, emanate from termination order issued by the respondents \u2013 These petitions essentially proceed on the allegation that the respondents committed wilful disobedience of the order of this Court in not affording prior opportunity of hearing to the petitioners and similarly placed persons despite express direction contained in the said order \u2013 High Court had set aside the termination order issued by the respondents, solely on the ground that it was in violation of principles of natural justice \u2013 At the same time, liberty was given to the respondents to pass a fresh order in accordance with law including by undertaking exercise of segregating the tainted from the untainted candidates \u2013 Had the respondents concluded that it was possible to segregate tainted from untainted candidates, they would have been obliged to comply with the directions given by the High Court and restated by this Court to afford prior opportunity of hearing to the petitioners and similarly placed persons before passing fresh, reasoned order \u2013 However, from the subject termination order which is a speaking order, it is crystal clear that after due enquiry and taking into consideration all aspects of the matter, in particular the enquiry reports and the opinion of the experts including final report of SIT, the respondents were of the considered opinion that it was not possible to segregate tainted from the untainted candidates for reasons recorded in that order \u2013 In light of the conclusion reached by the respondents that it was not possible to segregate the tainted from the untainted candidates, in law, it must follow that the respondents could annul the entire selection process and pass the impugned order without giving individual notices to the petitioners and similarly placed persons \u2013 Thus, there was nothing wrong in respondents issuing the said termination order without affording prior opportunity to the petitioners and similarly placed persons. Constitution of India: Arts 32 and 226 \u2013 If the termination order is assailed on the ground of violation of principles of natural justice or fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution, such a grievance can be brought before the constitutional Court including by way of writ petition under Art.32 of the Constitution of India \u2013 It is a different matter that this Court may be loath in entertaining the grievance directly under Art.32 and instead relegate the petitioner(s) before the High Court to first exhaust the remedy under Art.226 of the Constitution of India \u2013 In the present case, there are other proceedings pending in the form of contempt petitions and a transfer petition wherein the termination order is the subject matter \u2013 Thus, the arguments in these cases will be overlapping \u2013 In that, the self-same order has been impugned in the writ petition filed before this Court \u2013 The fact that other affected similarly placed persons have filed writ petitions directly before the High Court and which are stated to be pending, can be no impediment for this Court in entertaining and deciding the writ petition \u2013 For, the issue regarding the purport of orders passed by this Court needs to be answered appropriately in contempt petitions only by this Court \u2013 It is not open to the High Court to interpret or explain the order passed by this Court in previous proceedings between the parties \u2013 High Court can only follow the dictum of this Court which is binding on it \u2013 Accordingly, the preliminary objection taken by the respondents regarding the maintainability of writ petition under Art.32 of the Constitution by similarly placed persons directly filed before this Court to assail the impugned order which is also subject matter of second set of contempt petitions is not sustainable \u2013 Contempt of court."

XXXII, r.3 \u2013 The said application was closed by trial Court \u2013 The manner in which the trial Court disposed of the application under Or.XXXII, r.3 is improper and cannot at all be sustained \u2013 It is true that High Court was dealing only with a revision petition arising out of an order dismissing a petition under s.5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 But it does not take away or curtail the jurisdiction of High Court to look into the records with particular reference to an important rule of procedure, especially when the same relates to something concerning persons under disability \u2013 The rigorous nature of the Madras amendment to r.3 of Or.XXXII, is perhaps to be attributed to the wider jurisdiction that the High Court exercised on its original side, under Clause-17 of the Letters Patent and the parens patriae jurisdiction that a Court normally exercises while dealing with cases of minors \u2013 Therefore, there is no illegality in the action of the High Court in summoning the original records in the suit and finding out whether or not a guardian of a minor defendant was appointed properly in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Or.XXXII, r.3, even in the absence of a specific contention being raised by the petitioners \u2013 The contention that in a revision arising out of the dismissal of a petition under s.5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, the High Court cannot set aside the ex-parte decree itself, by invoking the power under Art.227 is not acceptable \u2013 It is too well settled that the powers of the High Court under Art.227 are in addition to and wider than the powers under s.115 of the Code \u2013 High Court did not commit error of jurisdiction in invoking Art.227 and setting aside the ex-parte decree \u2013 In fact High Court also went into the question whether a decree passed against a minor without proper appointment of aguardian, is a nullity ipso facto or whether the same would depend upon prejudice against the minor being established \u2013 High Court also found that in this case, the minor was prejudiced."

Also, injunctionsagainst highway projects have now become impossible to obtain in view of s.20A of the Specific Relief Act, which has been introduced w.e.f. 01.10.2018 \u2013 Land Acquisition Act, 1894 \u2013 ss.5A, 6.

        "HeadNote": "Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.34 \u2013 Application for setting aside award \u2013 Scope of interference \u2013 Held: In an application under s.34, the court is not expected to act as an appellate court and re-appreciate the evidence \u2013 The scope of interference would be limited to grounds provided under s.34 of the Arbitration Act \u2013 The interference would be so warranted when the award is in violation of \u201cpublic policy of India\u201d, which has been held to mean \u201cthe fundamental policy of Indian law\u201d \u2013 A judicial intervention on account of interfering on the merits of the award would not be permissible \u2013 However, the principles of natural justice as contained in s.18 and 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Arbitration Act would continue to be the grounds of challenge of an award \u2013 The ground for interference on the basis that the award is in conflict with justice or morality is now to be understood as a conflict with the \u201cmost basic notions of morality or justice\u201d \u2013 It is only such arbitral awards that shock the conscience of the court, that can be set aside on the said ground \u2013 An award would be set aside on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award and as such, which goes to the roots of the matter \u2013 However, an illegality with regard to a mere erroneous application of law would not be a ground for interference \u2013 Equally, re-appreciation of evidence would not be permissible on the ground of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.34 \u2013 Arbitral Tribunal passed the award in favour of SICAL holding that there was a change in law and thereby granting reliefs as prayed for by SICAL \u2013 It directed conversion of Container Terminal of TPT from royalty model to revenue share model \u2013 The finding of the Arbitral Tribunal was based on a premise that when TPT entered into a contract with SICAL there was an existing policy, which provided royalty to be factored into the cost while fixation of tariff and that subsequently, the GoI changed its policy on 29 th July, 2003 thereby providing that royalty payment/revenue sharing will not be factored into/taken into account as cost for fixation/revision of tariff by TAMP; and that there was subsequent change in policy on 31 st March, 2005 by which part of royalty was permitted to be factored into the cost \u2013 According to the Arbitral Tribunal, there was a change in policy, which amounted to change in law, which, in turn, adversely affected SICAL \u2013 Award of Arbitral Tribunal challenged by TPT before the District Judge \u2013 District Judge dismissed the s.34 petition \u2013 TPT successfully challenged before the High Court \u2013 Aggrieved SICAL filed instant appeals \u2013 Held: When the bid document was notified and when SICAL submitted its bid and LoI was issued to it, there were no guidelines in vogue \u2013 Even the guidelines of February 1998 do not provide for royalty being factored as cost while fixation of tariff \u2013 On the contrary, the tariff order of 1999 specifically clarifies that it has left the royalty issue to be decided by TPT and the GoI \u2013 It has specifically clarified that the approval by TAMP should not be interpreted to be amounting to any implicit approval of royalty-related issue \u2013 Further, the tariff order issued on 20 th September, 2002 specifically rejects the claim of SICAL for factoring any royalty as cost while tariff/price fixation \u2013 SICAL has challenged the said order before the High Court by way of writ petition, which petition has been allowed \u2013 It is also not in dispute, that on account of interim order passed by the High Court dated 8 th November, 2002, SICAL is still continuing to charge at rates notified in the 1999 tariff order \u2013 In this scenario, the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal, that there was a law when the Agreement was entered into between the parties, which provided royalty as a pass-through and that the said law has been changed for the first time in 2003 and subsequently again changed in 2005, is a finding based on \u2018no evidence\u2019 \u2013 Had the Arbitral Tribunal perused the tariff orders of 1999 and 2002, it would have found that in the 1999 tariff order TAMP has specifically observed that its approval of the tariff should not be construed as its implicit approval of royalty-related issue and the 2002 tariff order specifically states that royalty was not permitted to be factored in the cost while determining tariff \u2013 The Arbitral Tribunal has totally failed to take into consideration this aspect of the matter \u2013 As such, since the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal, that there was an existing law to the effect that the royalty payable shall be permitted as a pass-through in cost while fixation of tariff, is based on \u2018no evidence\u2019 and the finding, that there was a change in law in 2003 and 2005 is based on without taking into consideration the relevant evidence, would come in the realm of perversity as explained by this Court in paragraph 31 of the Associate Builders \u2013 The findings are based on \u2018no evidence\u2019 and \u2018ignorance of vital evidence\u2019 in arriving at its decision. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.34 \u2013 Whether the Arbitral Tribunal was justified in passing an award thereby substituting \u2018royalty payment module\u2019 to the \u2018revenue-sharing module\u2019 \u2013 A contract duly entered into between the parties cannot be substituted unilaterally without the consent of the parties \u2013 The intention of the parties could be gathered from the documents on record \u2013 SICAL made representation to TPT seeking a relief under the terms of Article 14.3 of the Agreement \u2013 TPT informed SICAL that the issues raised by it were under examination \u2013 However, TPT refused to consider SICAL\u2019s application for relief since, according to it, the issue raised by SICAL was pending before the High Court \u2013 SICAL filed writ petition before High Court \u2013 High Court allowed the writ petition clarifying that the petition pending before the High Court had nothing to do with the representation under Article 14 of the License Agreement and remanded the matter to TPT for consideration afresh \u2013 TPT rejected the claim of SICAL \u2013 TPT has specifically observed that any change in the Agreement cannot be done without prior approval of the GoI \u2013 SICAL wrote to TPT invoking arbitration under Article 15.3 of the License Agreement \u2013 TPT strenuously contested the claim of SICAL with regard to prayer for change from \u2018royalty payment mode\u2019 to \u2018revenue sharing mode\u2019 \u2013 It could, thus, be seen that SICAL wanted the Agreement to be amended so as to change the \u2018royalty payment method\u2019 to \u2018revenue- sharing method\u2019 \u2013 TPT was always opposed to it \u2013 The intention of TPT is apparent from its various communications and its stand before the Arbitral Tribunal, that it was not agreeable for amendment of the Agreement from \u2018royalty payment method\u2019 to \u2018revenue-sharing method\u2019 \u2013 However, ignoring the stand of TPT, by the impugned Award, the Arbitral Tribunal has thrust upon a new term in the Arbitration: An Arbitral Tribunal is not a Court of law \u2013 Its orders are not judicial orders \u2013 Its functions are not judicial functions \u2013 It cannot exercise its powers ex debito justitiae."

Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Part IXB (consisting of Arts.243ZH to 243ZT) inserted by the Constitution 97 th Amendment Act and Art.368(2) proviso \u2013 Constitutional amendment inserting Part IXB found to be ultra vires the Constitution for want of requisite ratification under Art.368(2) proviso \u2013 Whether, even if Part IXB is constitutionally infirm qua co-operative societies operating within a State, it would yet operate qua multi-State co-operative societies and in Union territories which are not States \u2013 Held (per R.F. Nariman, J. [for himself and B.R. Gavai, J.]) (per majority) \u2013 The Constitution 97 th Amendment Act is void for want of ratification but it cannot be said that this would render the entire amendment still- born \u2013 The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the Constitution 97 th Amendment Act makes it clear that the Scheme qua multi-State cooperative societies is separate from the Scheme dealing with \u201cother cooperative societies\u201d, Parliament being empowered, so far as multi-State cooperative societies are concerned, and the State legislatures having to make appropriate laws laying down certain matters so far as \u201cother cooperative societies\u201d are concerned \u2013 Part IXB of the Constitution is operative insofar as it concerns multi- State co-operative societies both within the various States and in the Union territories of India \u2013 Held (per K.M. Joseph, J.) (dissenting) \u2013 Doctrine of Severability must apply on surer foundations \u2013 Provisions relating to Art.243ZI to Art.243ZQ and Art.243ZT, are unconstitutional for non-compliance, with the mandate of the proviso to Art.368(2) of the Constitution \u2013 However, it cannot be said that the Doctrine of Severability will apply to sustain Art.243ZR and Art.243ZS to the multistate cooperative societies operating in the Union Territories, and that, it would not apply to cooperative societies confined to the Union Territories \u2013 Once the Court has painted the substantial provisions (Art.243ZI to 243ZQ), with the brush of unconstitutionality, rendering those provisions, still born, the provisions contained in Art.243ZR and Art.243ZS cease to be workable and are impossible to sustain \u2013 Constitution (Ninety Seventh Amendment) Act, 2011 \u2013 Doctrine of Severability \u2013 Applicability \u2013 Co-operative Societies."

Regn 39(2)(a), 39(3) \u2013 Trustees \u2013 Power of \u2013 Held: There are sufficient guidance and safeguards in the Regulations itself on the power of the trustees to decide on winding up of the fund \u2013 It cannot be accepted that the trustees under clause (a) to Regn 39(2) have been given absolute and unbridled power to wind up a scheme \u2013 Language of clause (a) to Regn 39(2) states that the trustees must form an opinion on the happening of any event which requires the scheme to be wound up \u2013 Further, as per Regn 39(3), the trustees are bound to give notice disclosing the circumstances leading to the winding up of the scheme \u2013 Trustees are, thus, required to come to a conclusion that due to specific circumstances articulated in writing, the scheme is required to be wound up \u2013 Trustees hold the assets of the scheme in fiduciary capacity on behalf of the investors \u2013 They are experts in the field and, thus, conferred the power under Regn 39(2)(a) to decide whether or not a scheme should be wound up \u2013 Expression \u2018occurrence of any event\u2019 is not to be read in isolation but with the words \u2018requires the scheme to be wound up\u2019 \u2013 Read in this manner, there is no vagueness which can be described as transcending into realm of arbitrariness, on the other hand, the prerequisite statutory mandate is clear \u2013 This is not a case of excessive delegation wherein the legislative function has been abdicated and passed on to the trustees who can act as per their whims and fancies \u2013 Thus, the High Court\u2019s holding that the opinion of the trustees under clause (a) to Regn 39(2) must be consented to; and that the decision of the trustees and SEBI to wind up a scheme is final and binding on the unit holders \u2013 Appeal before this Court \u2013 This Court in its earlier order accepting the poll results, directed winding up of six mutual fund schemes \u2013 As regards, interpretation of Regns 39 to 42 and their interrelation with Regn 18(15)(c) and constitutional validity of Regns 39 to 42, held: Regulations of 1996 do not suffer from the vice of manifest arbitrariness, thus, Regulations of 1996 constitutionally valid \u2013 Applying principle of harmonious construction to Regn 18(15)(c) with Regns 39 to 42, would mean that the opinion of the trustees would stand, but the consent of the unitholders is a pre-requisite for winding up \u2013 Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Constitutional validity of 1996 Regulations \u2013 Held: Regulations of 1996 do not suffer from the vice of manifest arbitrariness \u2013 Since the Regulations are in the nature of economic Regulations, while exercising the power of judicial review, restraint would be exercised unless clear grounds justify interference \u2013 Views would not be supplanted for that of the experts as this can put the marketplace into serious jeopardy and cause unintended complications \u2013 Regs. 18(15)(c) and 39 to 42. Regn 18(15)(c) with Regns 39 to 42 \u2013 Interpretation of Regns 39 to 42, their interplay and harmonious construction with Regn 18(5)(c) \u2013 Held: Under clause (a) of Regn 39(2) the power of winding up of a scheme is vested with the trustees, under clause (b) with the unitholders and under clause (c) with the SEBI, however, under Regn 18(15)(c), the trustees are required to seek consent of the unit holders, when they by majority decide to wind up a scheme \u2013 Use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 in Regn 18(15)(c) is couched as a command \u2013 Expression \u2018when the majority of the trustees decide to wind up\u2019 in Regn 18(15)(c) manifestly refers to clause (a) to Regn 39(2) as this is the only Regulation which entitles the trustees to wind up the scheme \u2013 Regn 18(15)(c), when it refers to trustees\u2019 decision to wind up, it implies the trustees\u2019 opinion to wind up the scheme \u2013 Applying principle of harmonious construction in the context of the Regulations of 1996, would mean that the opinion of the trustees would stand, but the consent of the unitholders is a pre-requisite for winding up \u2013 This interpretation does not in any way dilute or render clause (b) to Regn 39(2) meaningless or redundant \u2013 This clause applies where the winding up process is initiated at the instance of 75% of the unitholders \u2013 Clause (b) does not in any manner reflect that clause (c) to Regn 18(15) should not be read as it ordains in simple words \u2013 Regn 41 refers to and relates to the procedure and manner of winding up which cannot be equated with the requirement of consent as postulated by Regn 18(15)(c) \u2013 Regn 41(1) applies even in cases where 75% unitholders have passed the resolution for winding up of the scheme under Regn 39(2)(b) or where SEBI directs the scheme to be wound up in the interest of the unitholders under Regn 39(2)(c) \u2013 On the other hand Regn 18(15)(c) applies only when majority of the trustees form an opinion and decide to wind up or prematurely redeem the units in entirety, a situation covered by Regn 39(2)(a) \u2013 To ignore the mandate of Regn 18(15)(c) would nullify the legislative intent \u2013 Need to obtain consent of the unitholders is mandated under clause (c) to sub-Regn 15 to Regn 18 when the trustees under clause (a) to Regn 39(2) decide to wind up a scheme \u2013 To deny the unitholders a say, when Regn 18(15)(c) requires their consent, debilitates their role and right to by the unitholders in terms of the mandate of Regn 18(15)(c) is accepted. 561 A B C D E F G Unitholders and creditors \u2013 Difference between \u2013 Held: Regulations rightly draw the distinction between creditors and theunitholders \u2013 Unit holders are investors who take the risk and, thus, entitled to profits and gains and they must also bear the losses, if any \u2013 Unitholders are not entitled to fixed return or protection of the principal amount whereas creditors are entitled to fixed return as per mutually agreed contracts \u2013 Their rate of return is in the nature of interest and not profit or loss \u2013 Creditors are not risk takers as is the case with the unitholders \u2013 To equate the unitholders with either the creditors or the home buyers will be unsound and incongruous. Regn 53 \u2013 Provision regarding despatch of dividend warrents or proceeds by mutual fund and asset management company-AMC \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Clause (b) to Regn 53 requires that the AMC to despatch the redemption or repurchase proceeds within ten working days from the date of redemption or repurchase \u2013 Issue as regards whether the AMC or the trustees are bound to honour and pay the redemption or repurchase proceeds for requests received before the date of publication of notice in terms of Regn 39(3) \u2013 High Court held the expression \u2018business\u2019 in clause (a) of Regn 40 refers to business activity and, thus, would include payment of redemption proceeds to the unit holders, which would include the request for redemption received prior to the date of publication under Regn 39(3) \u2013 On appeal, held: There is a need for greater clarity on the factual matrix, which would be possible once the pending proceedings are concluded \u2013 In view thereof, several issues left open at this stage \u2013 Observations in the instant Order and the earlier Order not to be read as binding factual findings or conclusions on any disputed facts, which could be a subject matter of a show- cause notice and consequent decision, though legal interpretation of Regn 18(15)(c) and Regns 39 to 42 are conclusive and binding. Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992: s. 11, 11B \u2013 Functions of Securities and Exchange Board of India-SEBI \u2013 Power to issue directions and levy penalty \u2013 Explained. G H Interpretation of statutes: Process of interpretation \u2013 Three stage, literal interpretation, propositional interpretation and purposive interpretation \u2013 Held: Interpretation is sometimes a three- stage process \u2013 At first, the words being interpreted should be understood according to their grammatical meaning in their literal and popular sense \u2013 In the second stage, it is considered whetherin the given context the plain meaning is obscure as the text gives rise to choice of more than one interpretation, or the propositional interpretation fails to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation \u2013 In such cases at the third stage, the court applying interpretative tools selects an interpretation advancing the legislative intent without rewriting the provision \u2013 Legislative intent is gathered from the object and purpose of the provision and the legislation \u2013 Courts do lean towards a pragmatic and purposive interpretation as there is an assumption that the draftsmen legislate to bring about a functional and working result.

Plea that WB-HIRA intended to cover the field of \u2018housing industry\u2019 under Entry 24 of List II \u2013 Held: WB-HIRA did not fall under the ambit of the term industry within the meaning of Entry 24 of the State List. Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016:ss. 88 and 89 \u2013 Interpretation and interplay of \u2013 Held: s.88 stipulates that the application of other laws is not barred, the provisions of the legislation \u201cshall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the provisions of any other law for the time being in force\u201d \u2013 s. 89 provides for overriding effect to the provisions of the RERA when it stipulates that it \u201cshall have effect, notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force\u201d \u2013 s. 88 is an indicator of the fact that Parliament has not intended to occupy the whole field so as to preclude altogether the exercise of legislative authority whether under other Central or State enactments \u2013 s. 88 does not exclude recourse to other remedies created by cognate legislation \u2013 Where the cognate legislation has been enacted by a State legislature, s.88 is an indicator that Parliament did not wish to oust the legislative power of the State legislature to enact legislation on cognate or allied subjects \u2013 On facts, State legislature-WB-HIRA has not enacted cognate or allied legislation but legislation which is identical to and bodily lifted from the Parliamentary law-RERA \u2013 This plainly implicates the test of repugnancy by setting up a parallel regime under the State law \u2013 State legislature has encroached upon the legislative authority of Parliament which has supremacy within the ambit of the subjects falling within the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule \u2013 Exercise conducted by the State legislature of doing so, is plainly unconstitutional \u2013 West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017.Salient features of RERA Act \u2013 Explained. Constitution of India: Art. 254 \u2013 Repugnancy \u2013 Salient features of Art. 254 \u2013 Stated.Doctrine of repugnancy u/Art. 254(1) \u2013 Held: Operates within the fold of the Concurrent List \u2013 Clause (1) of Art. 254 envisages that the law enacted by Parliament will prevail and the law made by the legislature of the State shall be void \u201cto the extent of repugnancy\u201d \u2013 Clause (1) does not define what is meant by repugnancy \u2013 Clause (1) indicate that the provision deals with a repugnancy between a law enacted by the State legislature with a provision of a law made by Parliament which it is competent to enact; or to any provision of an existing law; and with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List. Art. 254 \u2013 Repugnancy \u2013 Concept of \u2013 Three types of repugnancy \u2013 Held: First type envisages a situation of an absolute or irreconcilable conflict or inconsistency between a State legislative enactment with a Parliamentary law with reference to a matter in the Concurrent List \u2013 Second situation involving a conflict between State and Central legislations may arise when a Parliamentary legislation is so complete and exhaustive as a Code as to preclude the existence of any other legislation by the State \u2013 Third test of repugnancy is where the law enacted by Parliament and by the State legislature regulate the same subject \u2013 Allowing the exercise of power over the same subject matter would trigger the application of the concept of repugnancy \u2013 This may implicate the doctrine of implied repeal \u2013 In such cases, harmonious construction can be resorted to, to ensure that the operation of both the statutes can co-exist \u2013 Where, however, the competing statutes are not of the same legislature, it then becomes necessary to apply the concept of repugnancy, bearing in mind the intent of Parliament \u2013 Primary effort in the exercise of judicial review must be to harmonise \u2013 Repugnancy is not an option of first choice but something which can be drawn where a clear case based on the application of one of the three tests arises for determination. Art. 254(2) \u2013 Presidential assent under, for WB-HRA \u2013 Lack of \u2013 Held: State of West Bengal would have had to seek the assent of the President before enacting WB-HIRA, where its specific repugnancy with respect to RERA and its reasons for enactment would have had to be specified and this was not done \u2013 Thus, WB- HIRA did not have presidential assent and was repugnant to RERA under Article 254 \u2013 West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 \u2013 Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.Art. 142 \u2013 Jurisdiction under \u2013 Exercise of \u2013 WB-HIRA since its enforcement, applied to building projects and implemented by the authorities constituted under the law in the State of West Bengal \u2013 WB-HIRA having declared unconstitutional, there is a need to avoid uncertainty and disruption in respect of actions taken in the past \u2013 Thus, in exercise of jurisdiction u/Art. 142, direction that striking down of WB-HIRA would not affect the registrations, sanctions and permissions previously granted under the legislation \u2013 West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017 . Words and phrases:Expression \u201cany other law for the time being in force\u201d \u2013 Meaning of, in the context of ss. 89, 2(zr) and 18(2) of the RERA Act \u2013 Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. Expression \u2018 is in addition to and not in derogation of any other law\u2019 \u2013 Meaning of, in the context of s. 88 of the RERA Act \u2013 Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016."

Leela Bhai by the Kerala High Court \u2013 Appeal by the unsuccessful candidates was dismissed by the Coordinate Bench of the Supreme Court \u2013 However, matter referred to the Full Bench of the High Court from an another matter upheld the contention of the in-service candidates (who were not graduates) to be considered for recruitment to the posts of clerk/cashier \u2013 On appeal, held: The decision of the Full Bench was not brought to the notice of the Coordinate Bench of the Supreme Court, when the appeal in the case of Valsala Devi was dismissed \u2013 The case of Vasala Devi was in relation to promotion whereas in the instant case, the vacancies are to be filled by direct recruitment \u2013 The in-service candidates primarily had relied on regulations (GOs) dated 15.06.1982, 30.09.1986 and 23.03.1988 before the Full Bench of the High Court \u2013 The impact of these GOs was not brought before the Coordinate Bench of the Supreme Court \u2013 Decision of the Coordinate Bench of the Supreme Court would not constitute a binding precedent so far as the present set of proceedings are concerned \u2013 According to KPSC, the source of power of making these regulations (GOs) was s. 80 of the Act \u2013 The GO of 1988 establishes that the State Government had intended to keep in abeyance the benchmark pay provision as specified in Rule 186 \u2013 For determining the educational qualification of the in-service candidates the State Government has proceeded by issuing various GOs without the benchmark pay stipulation for recruitment to the posts of clerk/cashier from in- service category and made SSLC qualification to be acceptable eligibility criteria \u2013 This practice developed under 1969 Act is indicative of the fact that for in-service candidates applying for direct recruitment to the posts of clerk/cashier in District co-operative Banks, the minimum eligibility criteria so far as eligibility is concerned is SSLC or equivalent and floor-level pay stipulation would not apply \u2013 If an advertisement is made providing for eligibility criteria different from that statutorily prescribed, it would be open to the candidates to challenge the legality of such eligibility criteria \u2013 It was not permissible on the part of KPSC to prescribe qualification as minimum eligibility criteria which is beyond that prescribed by the statute."
