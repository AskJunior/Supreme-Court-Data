Interpretation of Statutes: Harmonious construction \u2013 Held: In interpreting two provisions of a statute, courts must adopt the interpretation which does not defeat either provision and advances the remedy envisaged by their enactment \u2013 It is settled principle of law that where two provisions of an enactment appear to conflict, courts must adopt an interpretation which harmonises, to the best extent possible, both provisions \u2013 Where two provisions of an enactment appear to be in conflict, courts do not readily presume an \u2018either/or\u2019 situation \u2013 Courts must construe the provisions harmoniously to ensure, as far as possible, the effective operation of both provisions in a manner that furthers the purpose of the enactment \u2013 Every provision, phrase, clause and word must be interpreted in a manner to further the object of the enactment \u2013 No word or part of a statute should be construed in isolation \u2013 Chhatisgarh Cooperative Societies Act, 1960.

Appellant challenged the grant of moderation/grace marks to candidates appointed on 30.03.2009 and sought his appointment as District Judge \u2013 High Court set aside the grant of moderation marks and directed to recast the select list \u2013 SLP against said order also dismissed \u2013 Revised merit list of qualified candidates prepared and appellant appointed in cadre of District Judge by Order dated 22.09.2010, however, she joined on 24.02.2011\u2013 After the advertisement was published for direct recruitment, six officers were promoted by transfer to the cadre of District Judge but without prejudice to the claim of direct recruits \u2013 Claim by appellant for notional seniority w.e.f. the date of appointment of other candidates through the same selection i.e. w.e.f. 30.03.2009 as directed by the High Court \u2013 Administrative Committee found that the total cadre strength of the District Judges was 96 whereas 24 posts were to be filled up by direct recruitment but only 18 officers were holding the post of District Judges \u2013 Administrative Committee noticed that appointment by transfer of six promotee officers on 29.05.2007 was in exigency of service pending direct recruitment and directed that the candidates appointed in excess of the quota were entitled to seniority from the date such candidates were adjusted against the available vacancies within their quota \u2013 Consequent to the order of the Administrative Committee, the High Court issued Office Memorandum on 26.10.2017 assigning seniority to the appellant \u2013 Said decision challenged before High Court \u2013 High Court held that Administrative Committee erred insofar as there was no quota prescribed for bytransfer appointees and quota was only for direct recruits and confined to permanent posts in the cadre of District Judges \u2013 High Court further held that Administrative Committee did not have power to decide on the seniority dispute between by-transfer appointees and direct recruits \u2013 High Court further noticed that it was not by appellant\u2019s fault that his appointment was delayed \u2013 Having returned this finding, High Court found that the appellant assumed charge on 24.02.2011 and he joined without demur in pursuance of G.O. dated 22.12.2010 while the other three were allowed to continue from the date they joined and therefore the appellant waived his right of notional seniority \u2013 It was further held that appellant slept over his rights and allowed the by transfer appointees to continue with the seniority \u2013 Appellant filed instant appeal \u2013 Held: In terms of r.6(2), the seniority is to be determined by the serial order in which the name appeared in the appointment order \u2013 Appellant was entitled to be appointed along with other three candidates but because of the action of High Court in adopting moderation of marks, the appellant was excluded from appointment \u2013 Since the select list was to be revised, the appellant would be deemed to be the part of the appointment along with other candidates in the same select list \u2013 As the actual date of appointment was on 24.02.2011, the appellant cannot actually be treated to be appointed on 30.03.2009 but is entitled to notional appointment from that date and consequential seniority \u2013 Further, an employee has no control over the employer to decide the representation or to finalise the seniority as per his wish \u2013 High Court took long time to decide the seniority claim \u2013 That fact would not disentitle the appellant to claim seniority from the date the other candidates in the same selection process were appointed \u2013 The fact that some of the officers were given selection grade would not debar the appellant to claim notional date of appointment as the appellant asserted his right successfully before High Court in an earlier round and reiterated such right by way of a representation \u2013 Moreover, there was specific condition in the letter of appointment by transfer of in-service appointees that their appointment was without prejudice to the recruitment of direct recruits \u2013 Kerala Higher Judicial Services Special Rules, 1961 Kerala Higher Judicial Services Special Rules, 1961: Seniority \u2013 Merely because the rule does not specifically say that 2/ 3 rd is the quota for in-service candidates, it will not mean that the promotions can be made irrespective of the cadre strength \u2013 The promotions may not be annulled, modified or reversed but a candidate will get seniority only if there is a quota meant for appointment of in-service candidates \u2013 The finding of the High Court that there was no quota for in-service candidates was clearly erroneous \u2013 The Full Bench in Haneefa\u2019s case rightly held that the quota for direct recruitment is 1/3rd of the total cadre strength and as a consequence 2/3rd is the quota for in-service candidates \u2013 As per the amended Rules, 25% is the quota for direct recruits and 50% is for by-transfer from category I of Sub-Judges, Chief Judicial Magistrates in the Kerala State Judicial Services on the basis of merit and ability and 25% of the posts are contemplated to be filled up by transfer based upon limited competitive examination and viva voce \u2013 Therefore, finding of High Court is contrary to the Full Bench judgment and, thus, not sustainable in law. Delay/Laches: Delay in deciding the representation by the High Court cannot defeat the rights of the appellant to claim seniority from the date the other candidates selected in pursuance of the same selection process.

VIII, r. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and if time can be extended for filing of written submissions in a suit under the aforesaid provision of the Code, the same would apply to the filing of response to a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act as well, and hence the provision of s. 13(2)(a) of the Consumer Protection Act would be directory and not mandatory \u2013 Held: It is noteworthy that Or. VIII, r. 1 r/w. Or. VIII, r. 10 prescribes that the maximum period of 120 days provided u/or. VIII, r. 1 is actually not meant to be mandatory but only directory \u2013 Or.

VII, r.11 CPC. "

Pharmacy Act, 1948 \u2013 All India Council of Technical Education Act, 1987 \u2013 In the field of pharmacy, PCI would have the jurisdiction or AICTE constituted under the AICTE Act \u2013 Held: PCI consists of experts in the field of pharmacy and related subjects connected with the education of pharmacy \u2013 On the other hand, so far as AICTE is concerned, only one member would be from the field of pharmacy and that too representative of PCI \u2013 Under the circumstances, the PCI is the body of experts connected with the subject of pharmacy and related subjects and therefore it will be in the larger interest and more particularly in the interest of education of pharmacy that PCI shall alone have the jurisdiction in the field of Pharmacy rather than AICTE \u2013 Further, both PCI and AICTE are the creature of the statute \u2013 The fight of supremacy between both regulators is unhealthy for the education sector as well as the institutions to permit two regulators to function in the same field \u2013 Therefore, when the PCI is consisting of the experts in the field of pharmacy and other related subjects, it is in the larger interest in the field of Pharmacy that the PCI must be given the power to regulate in the field of pharmacy.

CIT was followed \u2013 Consequently, the impugned judgment of the High Court was set aside.   "
