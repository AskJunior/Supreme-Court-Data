Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 Twin requirement for the lapse \u2013 Firstly, physical possession has not been taken and secondly compensation has not been paid \u2013 Whether the conditions are cumulative i.e. both are to be fulfilled for lapsing of acquisition proceedings or the conditions are in alternative (\u201ceither/or\u201d) \u2013 Held: s.24(2) of the Act of 2013 deals with a situation only where the award has been made five years or more before the commencement of the Act, but physical possession of the land has not been taken, nor compensation has been paid \u2013 As regards the collation of the words used in s.24(2), two negative conditions have been prescribed \u2013 General rule of statutory interpretation of positive and negative conditions are that positive conditions separated by \u2018or\u2019 are read in the alternative but negative conditions connected by \u2018or\u2019 are construed as cumulative and \u2018or\u2019 is read as \u2018nor\u2019 or \u2018and\u2019 i.e. the expression \u2018or\u2019 has to be read as conjunctive and conditions of both the clauses must be fulfilled \u2013 Thus, the word \u2018or\u2019 used in s.24(2) between possession and compensation has to be read as \u2018nor\u2019 or as \u2018and\u2019 \u2013 This would mean that the deemed lapse of land acquisition proceedings under s.24(2) takes place where due to inaction of authorities for five years or more prior to commencement of the Act of 2013, the possession of land has not been taken nor compensation has been paid \u2013 Thus, even if one condition is satisfied, there is no lapse \u2013 Interpretation of statutes. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 Interpreting \u201cor\u201d under s.24(2) of the Act of 2013 disjunctively \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: It would result in an anomalous situation, because, once compensation has been paid to the landowner, there is no provision for its refund \u2013 In case physical possession is with the landowner; and compensation has been paid, there is no provision in the Act for disgorging out the benefit of compensation \u2013 In the absence of any provision for refund in the Act of 2013, the State cannot recover compensation paid \u2013 The landowner would be unjustly enriched \u2013 This could never have been the legislative intent of enacting s.24(2) of the Act of 2013 \u2013 The principle of restitution, unless provided in the Act, cannot be resorted to by the authorities on their own \u2013 Absence of provision for refund in the Act of 2013 reinforces conclusion that the word \u201cor\u201d has to be read as conjunctively and has to be read as \u201cand\u201d \u2013 Doctrine of unjust enrichment and principle of restitution. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 Purpose of \u2013 Held: To punish acquiring authority for its lethargy in not taking physical possession nor paying compensation after making award five years or more before commencement of Act of 2013 in pending proceedings providing they would lapse. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24 \u2013 Vested right under \u2013 Held: s.24 of the Act of 2013 does not intend to take away vested rights \u2013 This is because there is no specific provision taking away or divesting title to the land, which had originally vested with the State, or divesting the title or interest of beneficiaries or third-party transferees of such land which they had lawfully acquired, through sales or transfers. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: proviso to s.24(2) \u2013 Whether proviso is part of s.24(2) or s.24(1)(b) \u2013 Held: The proviso is part of the scheme of s.24(2) \u2013 The entire provision of s.24(2), including the proviso, operates when there is inaction for a period of five years or more, as contemplated therein. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 Applicability to pending proceedings \u2013 Held: s.24(2) shall apply to the proceeding which is pending as on the date on which the Act of 2013, has been brought into force and it does not apply to the concluded proceedings \u2013 s.24(2) is not a tool to revive concluded proceedings and to question the validity of acquisition proceedings due to which possession were taken decades ago, or to question the manner of deposit of amount in the treasury \u2013 The Act of 2013 never intended revival of such claims \u2013 s.24(2) only contemplates lethargy/inaction of the authorities to act for five years or more. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 Whether gives rise to fresh cause of action \u2013 Held: s.24(2) of the Act of 2013 does not give rise to new cause of action to question the legality of concluded proceedings of land acquisition \u2013 s.24 does not revive stale and time-barred claims and does not reopen concluded proceedings nor allow landowners to question the legality of mode of taking possession to reopen proceedings or mode of deposit of compensation in the treasury instead of court to invalidate acquisition. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 Exclusion of period of interim order(s) \u2013 Held: Any court\u2019s interim order cannot be said to be inaction of the authorities or agencies; thus, time period is not to be included for counting the 5 years period as envisaged in s.24(2). Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) and its proviso \u2013 The expression \u2018paid\u2019 in the main part of s.24(2) does not include a deposit of compensation in court \u2013 The consequence of non-deposit is provided in proviso to s.24(2) in case it has not been deposited with respect to majority of land holdings then all beneficiaries (landowners) as on the date of notification for land acquisition under s.4 of the Act of 1894 shall be entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 2013 \u2013 In case the obligation under s.31 of the Act of 1894 has not been fulfilled, interest under s.34 of the said Act can be granted \u2013 Nondeposit of compensation (in court) does not result in the lapse of land acquisition proceedings \u2013 In case of non- deposit with respect to the majority of holdings for five years or more, compensation under the Act of 2013 has to be paid to the \u201clandowners\u201d as on the date of notification for land acquisition under s.4 of the Act of 1894. Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013: s.24(2) \u2013 When compensation, tendered, as provided in s.31(1) of the Act of 1894, but not paid/deposited in court \u2013 Whether acquisition lapse \u2013 Held: In case a person has been tendered the compensation as provided under s.31(1) of the Act of 1894, it is not open to him to claim that acquisition has lapsed under s.24(2) due to non-payment or non-deposit of compensation in court \u2013 The obligation to pay is complete by tendering the amount under s.31(1) \u2013 Land owners who had refused to accept compensation or who sought reference for higher compensation, cannot claim that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed under s.24(2) of the Act of 2013 \u2013 Land Acquisition Act, 1894 \u2013 s.31(1). Land Acquisition: Mode of taking possession \u2013 When possession of large area of land is to be taken, then it is permissible to take possession by drawing Panchnama \u2013 Possession. Possession: Concept of possession \u2013 Held: Possession comprises the right to possess and to exclude others, essential is animus possidendi \u2013 Possession depends upon the character of the thing which is possessed \u2013 If the land is not capable of any use, mere non-user of it does not lead to the inference that the owner is not in possession \u2013 The established principle is that the possession follows title \u2013 Possession comprises of the control over the property \u2013 The element of possession is the physical control or the power over the object and intention or will to exercise the power \u2013 Corpus and animus are both necessary and have to co-exist. Delay/laches: In matters of land acquisition, delay is fatal in questioning the land acquisition proceedings \u2013 In case possession has not been taken in accordance with law and vesting is not in accordance with s.16, proceedings before courts are to be initiated within reasonable time, not after the lapse of several decades \u2013 Land Acquisition Act, 1894 \u2013 s.16. Interpretation of Statutes: Addition or substraction of word(s) in a statute \u2013 Power of Courts \u2013 Held: While interpreting the statutory provisions, addition or subtraction in the legislation is not permissible \u2013 It is not open to the court to either add or subtract a word \u2013 There cannot be any departure from the words of law, as observed in legal maxim \u201cA Verbis Legis Non Est Recedendum\u201d \u2013 Legal maxim. Interpretation of Statutes: When two different expressions are used in the same provision of a statute, there is a presumption that they are not used in the same sense. Interpretation of statutes: Proviso to a provision \u2013 The function of the proviso is to explain or widen the scope \u2013 The proviso cannot travel beyond the provision to which it is attached. Interpretation of Statutes: Colon (punctuation mark) \u2013 Significance of its use \u2013 The use of the colon is to introduce a subclause that follows logically from the text before it \u2013 Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 \u2013 s.24(2). Judicial Notice: Judicial notice is taken of the fact that in no other Government security, rate of interest is higher on the amount being invested under ss.32 and 33 of the Act of 1894 \u2013 Higher rate of interest is available under s.34 to the advantage of landowners \u2013 Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Repeal: Applicability of the General Clauses Act \u2013 Held: When repeal is followed by a fresh enactment on the same subject, the provisions of the General Clauses Act would undoubtedly require an examination of the language of the new enactment if it expresses an intent different from the earlier repealed Act \u2013 The enquiry would necessitate the examination if the old rights and liabilities are kept alive or whether the new Act manifests an intention to do away with or destroy them \u2013 If the new Act manifests different intentions, the application of the General Clauses Act will stand excluded \u2013 General Clauses Act Words and phrases: Word \u2018paid\u2019, tender\u2019, \u2018vesting\u2019 \u2013 Meaning of, discussed.

Jagdish Balaram Bahira \u2013 Both Barapatre and Nimje are decisions of a two judge Bench and do not lay down any principle of law contrary to the binding three Judge Bench decision in FCI \u2013 Neither the DOPT circular dated 08.04.2019 nor the circular dated 20.06.2019 of the Department of Revenue can depart from the principles laid down in FCI \u2013 The circulars, hence only applied to the peculiar facts noted in Barapatre and Nimje \u2013 In FCI, it was held that once it was found that candidate had obtained admission upon a false representation to belong to the reserved category, the appointment would be vitiated by fraud and would be void ab initio \u2013 Therefore, the impugned Judgment of the High Court dated 11.07.2016, set aside.

XLI, r.22 reveals that there is no restriction on the right to appeal of any of the parties \u2013 Any party aggrieved by any part of the award would be entitled to prefer an appeal \u2013 Thus, any respondent, though he may not have appealed from any part of the decree, apart from supporting the finding in his favour, is also entitled to take any cross-objection to the decree which he could have taken by way of appeal \u2013 Further, r.22(4) of Or. XLI specifically provides that even if original appeal is withdrawn or dismissed for default, the cross-objection would nevertheless be heard and determined \u2013 Therefore, even if the appeal of the Insurance Company was dismissed in default and it was not interested to revive the appeal, still the High Court was required to decide the cross-objection of appellants on merits \u2013 Impugned judgment set aside \u2013 Matter remitted to High Court for deciding the cross-objection on merits \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.

Nadiadwala v. State of Maharashtra and Ors., allowed appeal by land owner \u2013 In view thereof, present case referred to larger Bench that delay and laches have to be ignored \u2013 Held: On facts, question of delay and laches need not be answered as s.4 notification that was struck down in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala\u2019s case is the very notification in the facts of this case wherein the entire acquisition proceedings were quashed \u2013 Unable to agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the s.4 notification not only deals with various other lands in Village Malad but also deals with a land in a different village altogether viz., Village Wadhawan, and that Supreme Court\u2019s judgment did not go to the extent of declaring the acquisition bad so far as village Wadhawan is concerned \u2013 So far as village Malad is concerned where the land in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala\u2019s case was land that was adjacent to the present land, the very s.4 notification was struck down and declared null and void \u2013 This being the case, it would not be in the interest of justice to allow the present appeal in favour of appellant, as this would amount to a discrimination between two persons who are otherwise similarly placed \u2013 Further, Kulsum R. Nadiadwala\u2019s case did not deal with newspaper publication at all \u2013 It only dealt with the requirement of publication in the Official Gazette and public notices of the substance of the notification being given in the locality in which the lands are acquired, both of which were held to be cumulative and mandatory requirements of s.4 \u2013 Given the fact that this is a Defence project in which possession has been with the Union since 1942, the same facts would obtain as in Kulsum R. Nadiadwala\u2019s case in which relief was granted \u2013 Therefore, present case cannot lead to a different conclusion on similar facts \u2013 Defence of India Rules, 1939 \u2013 r. 75A \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 141 and 142 "

Maharashtra Agricultural Lands (Ceiling on Holdings) Act, 1961: ss.8, 10 and 11 \u2013 Transfer and partition after cut-off date \u2013 Jurisdiction of Collector to declare such transfer/partition sham for determining ceiling area \u2013 Held: It is not possible to state that wherever the expressions \u201ctransfer\u201d and \u201cpartition\u201d occur in ss.8, 10 and 11 of the 1961 Act, they must be understood as meaning transfers and partitions which are genuine \u2013 If the word \u201cgenuine\u201d is added, it would amount to straining the language of these provisions and giving these provisions a construction which they cannot possibly bear - a construction that would go against the object of giving the Collector a limited jurisdiction to decide whether lands fall within the ceiling area, and in so doing, whether transfers and partitions between the cut-off date and commencement date should be \u201cignored\u201d \u2013 The language of s.11 also leads to the conclusion that even in case of a partition that is made after the cut-off date and before the commencement date, the power of the Collector is not to declare such partition sham, and therefore void, which is for a Civil Court to do, but is only to ignore such partition for the purpose of calculating ceiling area \u2013 Land Laws \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes "

State of Jammu and Kashmir reported as [1959] Suppl. SCR 270 and Sampat Prakash v.

Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 \u2013 s.2(g) \u2013 Whether land in occupation of appellant is \u2018shamilat deh\u2019 land and vests in the village common body \u2013 Held: In the revenue records, the land was shown as \u2018Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubi\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Dhera & Khubi\u2019 were the ancestors of the appellant \u2013 The possession is shown as that of proprietors/self-cultivators and an entry was made in favour of the Panchayat Deh in 1987-1988 \u2013 The land was always shown to be \u2018Shamlat Patti Dhera & Khubi\u2019 and in the cultivation of the appellant or his ancestors \u2013 Moreover, the land was never shown to be used for the benefit of the entire village community or even for a part of the community \u2013 The land cannot be described as \u2018Shamilat Deh\u2019 and, therefore, would not vest in the village proprietary body \u2013 The name of the appellant be entered in the column of ownership with the entry \u2018shamlat patti\u2019. Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 \u2013 \u2018shamilat deh\u2019 land \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: The word \u2018shamilat\u2019 basically means \u2018held in joint possession and undivided lands which are part and parcel of a village\u2019 \u2013 When these lands are held commonly by a village proprietary body, they are described as \u2018shamilat deh\u2019 land. Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 \u2013 \u2018taraf\u2019, \u2018patti\u2019, \u2018panna\u2019 and \u2018thola\u2019 \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: \u2018Taraf\u2019, \u2018patti\u2019, \u2018panna\u2019 and \u2018thola\u2019 are different terms but have a common strain or similarity running through them \u2013 These descriptions are of land of a group of villagers based on clan, caste, sect, area, etc. \u2013 In British India, the village was divided into different pattis/sections based upon caste, religion, occupation, etc. of the persons residing in the village \u2013 Patti is described as division of land into separate portions or strips in a village \u2013 These locations are known as pattis \u2013 Patti is basically, therefore, a small division of the village \u2013 The terms \u2018taraf\u2019, \u2018panna\u2019 and \u2018thola\u2019 may be different but are akin to patti and also deal with community of villagers residing separately \u2013 Therefore, they have virtually the same meaning \u2013 It is also apparent that a patti can normally be created out of the shamilat land only when a group of people enjoy some portion of the land out of the bigger common shareholding that is a patti.
