appellant enticed a seven year old girlto accompany him on the pretext of picking lychee fruits \u2013 Thereafterhe committed rape on her and killed her and dumped the dead bodyin bushes near the riverbank \u2013Trial court and High Courtconcurrently recorded the findings that the prosecution was able tosuccessfully establish the chain of circumstances leading tounmistakable conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offencesof rape and murder of the victim child as also of concealing herdead body \u2013 The fundamental fact, as held proved against theappellant was that the deceased was lastly seen in the company ofthe appellant when he took the deceased along with himself whileshooing away other children\u2013 Burden was on the accused toexplain his whereabouts after he was last seen with the deceasedand to show if, and when, the deceased parted with his company asalso the reason for his knowledge about the location of the deadbody\u2013 Appellant undoubtedly failed to discharge the burden castupon him by s.106 of the Evidence Act \u2013 This circumstance is astrong link in the chain of circumstances against him \u2013 In the givenset of circumstances, it could safely be said that the presumptioncontemplated by s.29 POCSO came into operation \u2013 The othersignificant fact, as held proved, was that the dead body of the victimchild was recovered at a faraway place near the riverbank at theinstance of the appellant \u2013 Appellant failed to satisfactorily explainhis whereabouts since he was last seen in the company of the deceasedas also his knowledge of the location of the dead body \u2013 Thesefacts and factors, taken together with the medical and other scientificevidence formed complete chain of circumstances, leading to theconclusion on the guilt of the appellant \u2013 Conviction of the appellantof offences under ss.376, 302, 201 IPC and ss.5/6 POCSO is upheld.Sentence/Sentencing: Rape and murder of seven year old girlchild \u2013 The heinous nature of crime like that of present one, inbrutal rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl child, definitelydiscloses aggravating circumstances, particularly when the mannerof its commission shows depravity and shocks the conscience \u2013 But,at the same time, considering that appellant had no criminalantecedents, came from a very poor socio-economic background,having a family comprising of wife, children and aged father, andunblemished jail conduct, probability of reformation andrehabilitation of the appellant is not ruled out \u2013 Therefore, case istreated to not fall in \u2018rarest of rare\u2019 category \u2013 Yet, the impact of theoffences in question on the conscience of the society as a wholecannot be ignored \u2013 Appellant was about 33-34 years of age at thetime of commission of crime in the year 2015 \u2013 Looking to the overallfacts and circumstances, it is held just and proper to award thepunishment of imprisonment for life to the appellant for the offenceunder s.302 IPC while providing for actual imprisonment for aminimum period of 30 years \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss. 376, 302,201 \u2013 Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act 2012 \u2013 ss.5, 6.Evidence: Child witness \u2013 Rural background of witness \u2013Discrepancies in evidence \u2013 In the process of appreciation ofevidence, trial court and High Court looked at the crux of the matteremerging from her testimony that she was indeed a witness to thefact that the deceased child was last seen in the company of theappellant when he took her along towards lychee farm \u2013 Thetestimony of child witness is categorical in regard to the facts andthere appears no reason to disbelieve her testimony, even if hercomprehension of time and hours appears to be wanting in maturity\u2013 It would be rather unrealistic to expect such maturity from a ten-year-old child coming from a rustic background.Constitution of India: Art.134 and Art.136 \u2013 ConcurrentFinding \u2013 Interference \u2013 Scope \u2013 As against any judgment/finalorder or sentence in a criminal proceeding of the High Court,regular appeals to Supreme Court are envisaged in relation to theeventualities specified in Art.134 of the Constitution of India ands.2 of the Supreme Court (Enlargement of Criminal AppellateJurisdiction) Act, 1970 \u2013 The present matter is not covered thereunder\u2013 Present appeals are by special leave in terms of Art.136 of theConstitution of India \u2013 In an appeal by special leave, where thetrial court and the High Court concurrently returns findings of factafter appreciation of evidence, each and every finding of fact cannotbe contested nor such an appeal could be dealt with as if anotherforum for reappreciation of evidence \u2013 Of course, if the assessmentby trial court and the High Court could be said to be vitiated byany error of law or procedure or misreading of evidence or indisregard to the norms of judicial process leading to seriousprejudice or injustice, Supreme Court may, and in appropriate caseswould, interfere in order to prevent grave or serious miscarriage ofjustice but, such a course is adopted only in rare and exceptionalcases of manifest illegality."

Class 42 dealingwith hotels, hotel related services and goods \u2013 \u201cSAI RENAISSANCE\u201dused by the respondents- was also in relation to Class 16 and Class42 \u2013 When the defendant\u2019s trade mark is identical with the registeredtrade mark of the plaintiff and the goods/services of the defendantare identical with the goods/services covered by registered trademark, the Court shall presume that it is likely to cause confusion onthe part of the public \u2013 Trial court rightly held that the goods of theappellant would be covered by s.29(2)(c) r/w s.29(3) \u2013 Use of theword \u201cRENAISSANCE\u201d by respondents would squarely be hit bysub-section(5) of s.29 \u2013 Further, use of the word \u201cSAIRENAISSANCE\u201d which is phonetically and visually similar to\u201cRENAISSANCE\u201d, would also be an act of infringement in view ofs.29(9) \u2013 High Court also erred in picking up only clause (c) ofs.29(4) without noticing other parts of the said sub-section \u2013Similarly, while considering the import of sub--section (1) of s.30,it only picked up clause (b) of s.30(1) ignoring the provisionscontained in clause (a) of s.30(1) \u2013 Order of High Court set aside,decree of the trial court is maintained \u2013 Intellectual Property.Trade Marks Act, 1999 \u2013 s.29(2)(c), 29(3) \u2013 Presumption u/s.29(3) \u2013 Held: In case of an eventuality covered u/clause (c) ofsub-section (2) of s.29 in view of the provisions of sub-section (3)of s.29, the Court shall presume that it is likely to cause confusionon the part of the public.Trade Marks Act, 1999 \u2013 Passing off and infringement ofregistered trade mark \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Discussed \u2013Intellectual Property.Trade Marks Act, 1999 \u2013 s.29(2), 29(4) \u2013 Distinction \u2013 Held:While sub-section (2) of s.29 deals with those situations where thetrade mark is identical or similar and the goods covered by such atrade mark are identical or similar \u2013 Sub-section (4) of s.29 dealswith situations where though the trade mark is identical, but thegoods or services are not similar to those for which the trade markis registered.Trade Marks Act, 1999 \u2013 s.29(9) \u2013 Respondent was using themark \u201cSAI RENAISSANCE\u201d, appellant claimed infringement of itsregistered trade mark \u201cRENAISSANCE\u201d \u2013 Held: Sub-section (9) ofs.29 provides that where the distinctive elements of a registered trademark consist of or include words, the trade mark may be infringedby the spoken use of those words as well as by their visualrepresentation \u2013 As such, the use of the word \u201cSAI RENAISSANCE\u201dwhich is phonetically and visually similar to \u201cRENAISSANCE\u201d,would also be an act of infringement in view of the provisions ofsub-section (9) of s.29.Trade Marks Act, 1999 \u2013 s.30 \u2013 Benefit under, on fulfillmentof twin conditions \u2013 Held: To avail benefit of s.30, it is required thatthe twin conditions are fulfilled, i.e., the use of the impugned trademark being in accordance with the honest practices in industrial orcommercial matters, and that such a use is not such as to take unfairadvantage of or be detrimental to the distinctive character or reputeof the trade mark.Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Principles of \u2013 Textual, contextualinterpretation \u2013 Held: While interpreting the provisions of a statute,it is necessary that the textual interpretation should be matchedwith the contextual one \u2013 Further, no part of a statute and no wordof a statute can be construed in isolation \u2013 Trade Marks Act, 1999.Words & Phrases \u2013 Trade Marks Act, 1999 \u2013 ss.29(2)(a), (b),29(4)(a), (b) \u2013 Use of word \u2018or\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis use of \u2018and\u2019 \u2013 Held: Whilethe legislature has used the word \u2018or\u2019 after clauses (a) and (b) insub-section (2) of s.29, it has used the word \u2018and\u2019 after clauses (a)and (b) in sub-section (4) of s.29 \u2013 The legislative intent is veryclear \u2013 Insofar as sub-section (2) of s.29 is concerned, it is sufficientthat any of the conditions as provided in clauses (a), (b) or (c) issatisfied \u2013 Whereas, by employing the word \u201cand\u201d after clauses (a)and (b) in sub-section (4) of s.29, it is clear that unless all the threeconditions are satisfied, it will not be open to the proprietor of theregistered trade mark to sue for infringement when though theimpugned trade mark is identical with the registered trade mark,but is used in relation to goods or services which are not similar tothose for which the trade mark is registered"
