        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration : Appellant, which undertook prawn cultivation,had obtained insurance coverage from respondent under a prawn insurancepolicy. Major outbreak of a bacterial disease called \u2018White Spot Disease\u2019 ledto mass mortality of the prawns in the appellant\u2019s farm. The insurance claimsubmitted by appellant was repudiated by respondent-insurance company inits entirety, which was challenged before the National Consumer DisputesRedressal Commission (NCDRC); and, in this second round of litigation beforethis Court, the further issue was whether the claim amount and interest quantifiedby NCDRC was just and equitable.Insurance \u2013 Requirement of uberrima fi des:Held : Uberrima fi des, i.e., good faith, is the requirement in a contractof insurance \u2013 This obligation and duty would rest on both parties not only atthe inception of the contract of insurance but throughout its existence and eventhereafter \u2013 On facts, despite the second surveyors report dated 22.09.1995quantifying the appellant\u2019s loss at `17,64,097/-, the respondent insurancecompany chose to repudiate the appellant\u2019s claim in its entirety, basing on thewholly unfounded assertion that the appellant had failed to maintain and provideproper records \u2013 This was also despite the clear finding of its earlier surveyors,M/s. Frank and Fair Investigators, that total loss was suffered by the appellant\u2013 Further, having attached great importance to the death certificate given bythe MPEDA/State Fisheries Department in its policy and its prescribed claimprocedure, the insurance company baldly brushed aside the Death Certificatedated 01.05.1995 furnished by the officials of the State Fisheries Department at Visakhapatnam \u2013 It is not open to an insurance company to ignore orfail to act upon a certificate or document that it had itself called for fromindependent and impartial authorities, subject to just exceptions, merelybecause it is averse to it or to its detriment \u2013 Having undertaken to indemnifyan insured against possible loss in specified situations, an insurance companyis expected to make good on its promise in a bonafide and fair manner andnot just care for and cater to its own profits. [Paras 12 and 13]Insurance \u2013 Computation of admissible loss \u2013 Methodology:Held : On facts, the insurance policy itself provided the method ofcomputation of the admissible loss \u2013There were three ways of computingthe admissible loss (Input Cost Method; Unit Cost Method and FortnightlyValuation Method) \u2013 NCDRC had assessed the appellant\u2019s total loss as`30,69,486.80 and awarded simple interest @ 10% p.a. \u2013 However, thevalues of loss worked out by the appellant were: `75,98,361/- (as per InputCost Method); `75,87,750/- (as per Unit Cost Method); and `79,20,000/-(as per Fortnightly Valuation Method) \u2013 Computations made by appellantare accurate \u2013 Appellant would be entitled to lowest of the aforestated threevaluations, viz., `75,87,750/- \u2013 Further, delay on part of insurance companyin settling the appellant\u2019s claim fairly and in a timely manner warrants thatit pays interest on the amount due and payable to appellant \u2013 Interest ratefi xed by NCDRC, viz, 10% is just and equitable.

[Para 13]Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.34 \u2013 Jurisdiction under:Held : The limited and extremely circumscribed jurisdiction of thecourt u/s. 34 of the Act, permits the court to interfere with an award, sansthe grounds of patent illegality, i.e., that \u201cillegality must go to the root of thematter and cannot be of a trivial nature\u201d; and that the tribunal \u201cmust decidein accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construesa term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground\u201d\u2013 The other ground would be denialof natural justice. [Para 15]Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 \u2013 s.37 \u2013 Scope of AppellateCourt to review fi ndings:Held : In appeal, s.37 of the Act grants narrower scope to the appellatecourt to review the fi ndings in an award, if it has been upheld, or substantiallyupheld u/s. 34 \u2013 It is important to notice that the old Act contained a provisionwhich enabled the court to modify an award \u2013 However, that power hasbeen consciously omitted by Parliament, while enacting the Act of 1996 \u2013This means that the Parliamentary intent was to exclude power to modifyan award, in any manner, to the court.

Trained teacher \u2013 They are trained toteach classes at higher level, post primary, secondary and above \u2013 For Primarylevel i.e. class I to class V the training is D.El.Ed-Diploma in elementaryeducation \u2013 Thus, by implication the inclusion of B.Ed. as a qualifi cationamounts to lowering down of the \u2018quality\u2019 of education at Primary level \u2013Need for \u2018quality\u2019 and meaningful primary education has been emphasized bythe legislature as well as by the academic authority \u2013 In primary education,any compromise on \u2018quality\u2019 of education would mean going against the verymandate of Article 21A and the RTE Act \u2013 Thus, the decision of the NCTE toinclude B.Ed. as a qualifi cation for teachers in a primary school is arbitrary,unreasonable and has no nexus with the object sought to be achieved by theAct \u2013 NCTE had so far consciously kept B.Ed. Degree out of the eligibility requirement \u2013 Thus, the High Court rightly struck down the notifi cationdated 28.06.2018.

[Paras 17 and 18]Education Institution \u2013 Sports quota \u2013 Rejection of candidatureon the ground of ineligibility due to their securing less than 75% marksin the qualifying examination \u2013 Direction issued:HELD : Seventeen (17) seats were earmarked for the sports category(under the 2% quota) \u2013 The university received a total of 34 applications, ofwhich 28 applicants fulfi lled the eligibility criterion -of securing 75% marksand above \u2013 Further, 16 out of the total 17 seats in the Sports Category wereallocated to eligible candidates and only 1 seat was vacant \u2013 In view of thefi ndings, direction issued to fi ll the remaining seat or seats by applicationof the standards spelt out in the sports policy of the UT of Chandigarh, asapplied by the respondent university to determine inter se sports merit ofthe candidates who had applied, but whose candidature was rejected onthe ground of ineligibility due to their securing less than 75% marks in thequalifying examination \u2013 These candidates however should have qualifi edin terms of the immediately preceding academic year\u2019s criterion, applicablefor the balance sports quota seat(s) \u2013 At the same time, candidates who wereselected and given admission not to be disturbed.

[Para 26]FIR \u2013 Importance and object of:Held: FIR in a criminal case is an extremely vital and valuable pieceof evidence for the purpose of corroborating the oral evidence adduced atthe trial \u2013 Object of insisting upon lodging of the FIR to the police in respectof commission of an off ence is to obtain early information regarding thecircumstances in which the crime was committed, the names of the actualculprits and the part played by them as well as names of the eye witnessespresent at the scene of occurrence. [Para 32]Delay/ Laches \u2013 Delay in lodging FIR \u2013 Ground to quash FIR:Held: Delay in the registration of the FIR, by itself, cannot be a groundfor quashing of the FIR \u2013 However, delay with other attending circumstancesrendering the entire case put up by the prosecution inherently improbable,may at times become a good ground to quash the FIR and consequentialproceedings \u2013 If the FIR, like the instant one, lodged after a period of morethan one year without disclosing the date and time of the alleged incidentand further without any plausible and convincing explanation for such delay,the accused cannot defend himself in the trial \u2013 Allegations are too vague and general \u2013 In the absence of all this material, the State cannot prove itscase against the accused persons.

Except in the rarest of rarecases, judicial notice of any fact is generally not taken in criminal mattersin the normal course of proceeding. The present matter falls in the categoryof rarest of rare cases. Certain inferences, observations and fi ndings arrivedat by the Division Bench of High Court in judgment dated 13.03.2007in the Habeas Corpus Petition, have a crucial impact on the merit of thepresent case, as it gives a complete picture as to how the prosecutionversion in the present case was being demolished brick by brick by usingpolitical authority and muscle power with the aid of not only the policeadministration but also with the aid of Public Prosecutor and, the PresidingOffi cer of the Trial Court also conducted himself in a manner unbecomingof a Judicial Offi cer, despite directions and continuous vigil by the HighCourt. The judgment dated 13.03.2007, which is a public document, iswell discussed and is based upon authoritative materials and was passedin consonance with the doctrine of audi alteram partem. Moreover, it hasa torch bearer eff ect over the facts of the case. Accordingly, judicial noticetaken by the Supreme Court of the inferences, observations and fi ndingsarrived at by the Division Bench and the directions issued in its judgmentdated 13.03.2007 to the extent of the subsequent conduct of the accused,deplorable functioning of the Public Prosecutor, Police Administrationand the Presiding Offi cer of the Trial Court to extend undesirable favourto the accused. [Paras 66, 67 and 68] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.8 \u2013 Subsequent conduct of accused \u2013 Adverseinference \u2013 Maxim \u201cqui sentit commodom, sentire debit et onus.\u201d:Held: In the case in hand, a double murder case, the conduct ofaccused-respondent no.2 was not only relevant u/s.8 of the Evidence Actbut also one of the major circumstances to arrive at a conclusion about hisguilt. Respondent No.2 was instrumental in making all possible eff orts towipe out the evidence against him. The tainted investigation shows thehighhandedness of the Respondent no.2, who was a powerful person, beinga sitting M.P. of the Ruling Party. The question is why the accused wasinstrumental, when he was not guilty of the off ence to which he was beingtried. The obvious answer would be that his guilty mind was fearful aboutthe result. [Paras 70, 72, 73 and 114]Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.74 \u2013 Bayan Tahriri / Written Statement ofdeceased \u2013 Evidentiary value:Held: FIR is a public document defi ned u/s.74 of the Evidence Act. Anypublic document does not stand proven by the mere fact of its production.At the stage of exhibiting any document as a piece of evidence, the truthof what is stated in the document is not considered. It is left open to fi nalevaluation at the trial after cross-examination, and the entire testimony ofthe witness about the existence and contents of the document is weighedin conjunction with various other factors emerging during a trial. Themarking of a piece of evidence as \u2018exhibit\u2019 at the stage of evidence in a trialproceeding is only for the purpose of identifi cation of evidence adducedin the trial and for the convenience of the Court and other stakeholders inorder to get a clear picture of what is being produced as evidence in a trialproceeding. In the present case, considering the failure of State machineryand failure of the Trial Court to ensure a fair trial from the perspective ofthe victim side, the aspect of non-marking of the FIR and Bayan Tahririas an exhibit, non-production of the formal witnesses, i.e., the ConstableClerk and Investigating Offi cer to prove the lodging of FIR/Bayan Tahririand fl imsy rejection of application fi led by a person seeking his examinationas a witness along with examination of two persons (who had signed saidwritten statement/Bayan Tahriri as attesting persons) as witnesses in the Trialproceeding do not vitiate the genuineness of the FIR and Bayan Tahriri, andno discount can be given to the accused persons for non-exhibition thereof.[Paras 82, 83, 85, 87 and 89] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.32 \u2013 Treatment of FIR /Bayan Tahriri asdying declaration:Held: Statement by an injured person recorded as FIR can be treated asa dying declaration and such a statement is admissible u/s.32 of the EvidenceAct. On facts, the deceased gave his statement in the form of Bayan Tahririand narrated the entire incident and circumstances of the transaction whichresulted in his death. Subsequently, he died on account of injuries suff eredby him in the incident in question. FIR lodged on the basis of Bayan Tahrirof the injured is liable to be treated as a dying declaration, which itself is asubstantive piece of evidence and is admissible u/s.32(1) of the EvidenceAct. [Paras 91 and 95]Evidence \u2013 Ocular evidence \u2013 Testimony of deceased\u2019s mother,an eyewitness, who was abducted by the accused side just before herexamination in the trial court.Held: The High Court ought to have considered the checkered historyof events that occurred in the case, resulting in the judgment of the DivisionBench of the High Court in the Habeas Corpus Petition containing seriousobservations about the conduct of all the stakeholders of the said criminaltrial. CW-1\u2019s fi rst examination was scrapped by the High Court on theallegation of her kidnapping just a few days before that fi rst examinationdated 03.11.2006. She was under continuous threat and fear of facing direconsequence, which is apparent on the face of the record. Under thesecircumstances, in case she had stated in the end of her cross-examination thather son had asked her to take the name of the accused before the Trial Court,there is nothing so contradictory or surprising so as to treat the rest of thesubstantive ocular evidence as tutored one. There is no serious discrepancyor variation in the testimony of CW-1 with regard to the sequence of eventsthat occurred during the incident in question. When the entire family of CW-1was facing so many storms, it is quite natural for a son to say to her mother(who was old, illiterate, rustic woman having faced immense trauma) thatshe should not forget to disclose the name of accused persons, in as much asthe second occasion of her examination, as ordered by the Division Benchof High Court under Section 311 of CrPC, was the last opportunity for herto speak the truth before the Trial Court. There is nothing unusual in thestatement of CW-1. Her statement is found to be reliable, and the Courtsbelow wrongly discarded it on the ground that it was hearsay and tutored.[Paras 101, 102, 103, 104 and 114] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.311 \u2013 Power under \u2013 Scope:Held: s.311 CrPC confers wide powers on any court at any stage of anyinquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code to summon material witnessor examine person present. Such person may not be a person summonedas a witness. Power to recall and re-examine is also vested. The concept isthat it should be essential for the just decision of the case. This power canbe exercised not only by the Trial Court but also by the appellate Court orrevisional Court. The logic behind this provision is that the endeavour of theCourts is to fi nd out the truth which would be essential for the just decisionof the case. [Para 112]Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss.302 and 307 \u2013 Double murder \u2013 Due toinjuries caused by fi re arm \u2013 Appeal against acquittal.Held: On facts, the post-mortem reports, show that the deaths werehomicidal in nature. The medico legal reports supported the prosecution\u2019sstory to the extent that the injuries were caused by a fi re arm, which provedfatal for two out of the three injured. Fard Bayan registered on oral statementgiven by one of the injured (who died subsequently), which was laterconverted into an FIR, was admissible in evidence and is to be read as adying declaration or his last statement. The prosecution had established, eventhrough the hostile witnesses, that the date, time, and place of incidence asgiven in the Fard Bayan were fully established. Adverse inference againstthe accused is drawn in view of their subsequent conduct. Judicial notice istaken of judgment in the Habeas Corpus petition dated 13.07.2007 regardingthe conduct of the accused, the investigating agency, the Public Prosecutorand the Presiding Offi cer conducting the trial. Statement of CW-1 is foundto be reliable, and the Courts below wrongly discarded it on the groundthat it was hearsay and tutored. The dying declaration and the statement ofCW-1 fully establish that it was Respondent No.2 (accused no.1), who hadcaused the injuries from his fi rearm weapon, which proved to be fatal fortwo out of the three injured and also caused injury to the third survivinginjured. Respondent no.2 thus liable to be convicted under ss.302 and 307IPC. The rest of the accused, although named in the chargesheet after dueinvestigation, since their names were not refl ected either in the Fard Bayanof the deceased (dying declaration) or in the statement of CW1, therefore,their acquittal is not disturbed.

Articles 72, 161,Constitution of India:Held: Sentencing is a judicial exercise of power \u2013 The act thereafterof executing the sentence awarded, however, is a purely executive functionwhich includes the grant of remission, commutation, pardon, reprieves, orsuspension of sentence \u2013 This executive power is traceable to Article 72and 161 of the Constitution of India \u2013 Whilst the statutory (u/s.432 CrPC)and constitutional (under Articles 72 and 161 of the Constitution) powersare distinct- the former limited power, is still an imprint of the latter (muchwider power), and must be understood as such and placed in this context \u2013This executive power which is inherently discretionary in nature, has to beexercised fairly, reasonably, and not arbitrarily \u2013 Absence to do so, wouldcompel the court to exercise its judicial review and in appropriate casesremit the matter for reconsideration \u2013 Procedure laid out in s.432(2), hasbeen held to be mandatory.[Paras 9 and 10]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Remission \u2013 Parameters tobe considered \u2013 Discussed.[Para 11]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Remission \u2013 Role of presidingjudge\u2019s view \u2013 Weightage to be attached:Held: The discretion that the executive is empowered with in executinga sentence, would be denuded of its content, if the presiding judge\u2019s viewwhichis formed in all likelihood, largely (if not solely) on the basis of thejudicial record- is mechanically followed by the concerned authority \u2013 Suchan approach has the potential to strike at the heart, and subvert the conceptof remission- as a reward and incentive encouraging actions and behaviourgeared towards reformation- in a modern legal system \u2013 If the presidingjudge\u2019s report is only refl ective of the facts and circumstances that led tothe conclusion of the convict\u2019s guilt, and is merely a reiteration of thosecircumstances available to the judge at the time of sentencing (some 14 ormore years earlier, as the case may be), then the appropriate governmentshould attach weight to this fi nding, accordingly \u2013 Such a report, cannot be relied on as carrying predominance, if it focusses on the crime, with littleor no attention to the criminal.[Paras 16 and 17]Sentencing \u2013 Heinous crimes:Held: Even at the stage of sentencing, the judge ideally is to exercisediscretion after looking at a wide range of factors relating to the criminaland not just the crime; but as noticed in numerous precedents that have dealtwith sentencing in the commission of heinous crimes, this is unfortunately,often not the reality \u2013 Guidance has been off ered by this court on how tomitigate this in recent years, but it is pragmatic to acknowledge that it willrequire time for our criminal justice system to incorporate, and uniformlyreach such standards.Sentencing \u2013 Imprisonment \u2013 Aim and goal of \u2013 Discussed.[Para19]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Remission \u2013 Report submittedby the SP in the second round was adverse \u2013 Duty of the appropriategovernment:Held: Report submitted by the Superintendent of Police in the secondround (was diametrically diff erent from that which was submitted in thefi rst round), was adverse \u2013 In each case, the appropriate government hasto be cognizant of the latent (not always) prejudices of the crime, that thepolice as well as the investigating agency, may be citing- especially in acase such as the present one, where the slain victims were police personnelthemselves, i.e., members of the police force \u2013 These biases may informthe report, and cannot be given determinative value \u2013 Apart from the otherconsiderations (on the nature of the crime, whether it aff ected the societyat large, the chance of its recurrence, etc.), the appropriate governmentshould while considering the potential of the convict to commit crimesin the future, whether there remains any fruitful purpose of continuedincarceration, and the socio-economic conditions, review: the convict\u2019s age,state of heath, familial relationships and possibility of reintegration, extentof earned remission, and the post-conviction conduct including, but notlimited to- whether the convict has attained any educational qualifi cationwhilst in custody, volunteer services off ered, job/work done, jail conduct,whether they were engaged in any socially aimed or productive activity, andthe overall development as a human being \u2013 The Board should not entirelyrely either on the presiding judge, or the report prepared by the police \u2013 It would also serve the ends of justice if the appropriate government had thebenefi t of a report contemporaneously prepared by a qualifi ed psychologistafter interacting/interviewing the convict that has applied for prematurerelease. [Paras 20 and 21]Adminstration of Criminal Justice \u2013 Sentencing \u2013 Balancingsocietal interests with the rights of the convict:Held: The majority view and the minority view in Sriharan underlinedthe need to balance societal interests with the rights of the convict (that ina given case, the sentence should not be unduly harsh, or excessive) \u2013 Thecourt acknowledged that it lies within the executive\u2019s domain to grant, orrefuse premature release; however, such power would be guided, and thediscretion informed by reason, stemming from appropriate rules.[Para 22]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Remission \u2013 Diff erent policieson the date of conviction and on the date of consideration for prematurerelease:Held: This court had grappled with the situation of diff erent remissionpolicies/rules prevailing at diff erent points of the convict\u2019s sentence- i.e.,when the policy on the date of conviction, and on the date of consideration forpremature release, are diff erent \u2013 It has been held that the policy prevailingon the date of the conviction20 , would be applicable \u2013 However, in Jagdishit was also recognised that if a more liberal policy exists on the date ofconsideration, the benefi t should be provided \u2013 In the present case, on the dateof conviction (24.05.2001), it is the pre-2002 policy that was applicable \u2013 Inthe old pre-2002 policy, there is no mention of any ineligibility criteria, muchless one that is analogous to Rule 529(iv)(b) of the 2002 policy, which wascited by the Remission Board in its rejection of the petitioner\u2019s applicationon 20.04.2023.

[Paras 23, 26, and 39]Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 22(4)(a) \u2013 Relevance of Art. 22(4)(a):Held: Reading of Art. 22(4)(a) would clearly indicate that no lawproviding for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a personfor a period beyond three months \u2013 Thus, an order of detention cannot be fora period longer than three months unless, the Advisory Board has reportedbefore the expiration of the said period of three months that there is, in its opinion such suffi cient cause for detention \u2013 If the Advisory Board does notgive its opinion within a period of three months from the date of detention, insuch a case, the order of detention beyond the period of three months wouldbecome illegal and not otherwise \u2013 If within the period of three months, theAdvisory Board opines that there was no suffi cient cause for such detentionthen, the State Government would have to release the detenu forthwith \u2013Thus, Art. 22(4)(a) in substance deals with the order of detention and hasnothing to do with the delegation of the power of detention by the StateGovernment to an Offi cer as stipulated u/s. 3(2) \u2013 Period of three monthsstipulated in Art. 22(4)(a) is relatable to the initial period of detention upto the stage of receipt of report of the Advisory Board and does not haveany bearing on the period of detention, which is continued subsequent tothe confi rmatory order being passed by the State Government on receipt ofthe report of the Advisory Board \u2013 Continuation of the detention pursuantto the confi rmatory order passed by the State Government need not alsospecify the period of detention; neither is it restricted to a period of threemonths only \u2013 If any period is specifi ed in the confi rmatory order, then theperiod of detention would be upto such period, if no period is specifi ed,then it would be for a maximum period of twelve months from the date ofdetention \u2013 State Government need not review the orders of detention everythree months after it has passed the confi rmatory order.

The scheme of examination specifi callystipulated that there shall be no cut off marks for the viva voce. Whetherthe decision of the High Court to prescribe a cut-off for the viva-voceexamination was arbitrary.Kerala State Higher Judicial Services Special Rules 1961 \u2013 rule 2(c)(iii) \u2013 The scheme which was notifi ed by the High Court on 13.12.2012clearly specifi ed that there would be no cut off marks in respect of theviva-voce \u2013 However, the decision of the High Court to prescribe a cutofffor the viva-voce examination was taken much after the viva-vocetests were conducted \u2013 Propriety:Held: The Administrative Committee of the High Court decided toimpose a cut off for the viva-voce examination actuated by the bona fi dereason of ensuring that candidates with requisite personality assume judicialoffi ce \u2013 Such a change would be required to be brought in by a substantiveamendment to the Rules which came in much later \u2013 This is not a casewhere the rules or the scheme of the High Court were silent \u2013 Where thestatutory rules are silent, they can be supplemented in a manner consistent with the object and spirit of the Rules by an administrative order \u2013 In thepresent case, the statutory rules expressly provided that the select list wouldbe drawn up on the basis of the aggregate of marks obtained in the writtenexamination and the viva-voce \u2013 This was further elaborated in the schemeof examination which prescribed that there would be no cut off marks forthe viva-voce \u2013 This position is also refl ected in the notifi cation of the HighCourt dated 30.09.2015 \u2013 In this backdrop, the decision of the High Courtsuff ered from its being ultra vires the 1961 Rules besides being manifestlyarbitrary. [Paras 15 and 16]Doctrines \u2013 Doctrine of legitimate expectation \u2013 Claim under:Held: An individual who claims a benefi t or entitlement based on thedoctrine of legitimate expectation has to establish: (i) the legitimacy of theexpectation; and (ii) that the denial of the legitimate expectation led to theviolation of Article 14. [Para 44]Doctrines \u2013 Doctrine of legitimate expectation \u2013 Whether the HighCourt\u2019s decision frustrates the legitimate expectation of the petitioners:Held: Rule 2(c)(iii) of the 1961 Rules provided at the material time that25% of the posts of District and Sessions Judges should be fi lled by directrecruitment from the Bar on the basis of aggregate marks/grade obtained inthe written examination and the viva-voce conducted by the High Court \u2013 Thescheme of examination specifi cally stipulates that there shall be no cut offmarks for the viva voce \u2013 The petitioners would have expected no minimumcut-off for the viva voce in view of the express stipulation in the scheme ofexamination \u2013 Both the above expectations of the petitioners are legitimateas they are based on the sanction of statutory rules, scheme of examination\u2013 The decision of the Administrative Committee to depart from the expectedcourse of preparing the merit list of the selected candidates is contrary to theunamended 1961 Rules \u2013 In the instant case, the requirement of a minimumcut-off for the viva-voce was introduced after the viva voce was conducted \u2013The petitioners had no notice that such a requirement would be introduced forthe viva voce examination \u2013 The High Court\u2019s decision to apply a minimumcut-off for the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectation ofthe petitioners \u2013 Since, the decision of the High Court is legally untenable andfails on the touchstone of fairness, consistency, and predictability, such a courseof action is arbitrary and violative of Article 14. [Paras 46, 47, 51 and 52] Principles \u2013 Principles of good administration:Held: The principles of good administration require that the decisionsof public authorities must withstand the test of consistency, transparency,and predictability to avoid being termed as arbitrary and violative of Article14. [Para 55]Doctrines \u2013 Doctrine of legitimate expectation \u2013 Limitation inapplication of:Held: A public authority must objectively demonstrate by placingrelevant material before the court that its decision was in the public interestto frustrate a claim of legitimate expectation. [Para 55]Directions \u2013 The High Court\u2019s decision to apply a minimum cutofffor the viva voce frustrated the substantive legitimate expectationof the petitioners \u2013 The decision of the High Court is legally untenable\u2013 Whether the petitioners can be inducted into the Higher JudicialService:Held: In terms of relief, it would be contrary to the public interest todirect the induction of the petitioners into the Higher Judicial Service afterthe lapse of more than six years \u2013 Candidates who were selected nearly sixyears ago cannot be unseated \u2013 They were all qualifi ed and have been servingthe district judiciary of the state \u2013 Unseating them at this stage would becontrary to public interest \u2013 To induct the petitioners would be to bring innew candidates in preference to those who are holding judicial offi ce for alength of time \u2013 To deprive the State and its citizens of the benefi t of theseexperienced judicial offi cers at a senior position would not be in publicinterest.

[Paras 23, 34, 44 and 48]Service Law \u2013 Interim relief for continuation in service granted\u2013 Impropriety:Held: Court or the Tribunal should be slow and circumspect in grantinginterim relief for continuation in service, unless prima facie evidence ofunimpeachable character is produced because if the public servant succeeds,he can always be compensated \u2013 But if he fails, he would have enjoyedundeserved benefi t of extended service and caused injustice to his immediatejunior \u2013 In the present case, High Court went to the extent of granting interimrelief extending the period of service beyond 60 years till the disposal ofthe Original Petition by the CAT \u2013 By virtue of such interim order whichthe High Court ordinarily should not grant, the respondent No. 1 althoughwas to retire in 2018 yet continued in service till 2021 \u2013 It is only whenSupreme Court stayed the operation of the impugned order passed by theHigh Court while issuing notice that the service of the respondent No.1came to an end. [Para 48]Service Law \u2013 Memorandum of Association of the Central Councilfor Research in Ayurvedic Sciences \u2013 Bye-Laws \u2013 Clauses 25(b), 34, 35and 47 \u2013 Plea of respondent No.1 was that the provisions of FR 56(bb)would apply to him in his capacity as an employee of the Council in viewof Clause 35, Bye-Laws of the Council by which the provisions of the FRand SR would apply to the employees of the Council mutatis mutandis:Held: Clauses 25(b), 34, 35 and 47 of the Bye-Laws in the Memorandumof Association indicate that the employees are recruited through a selectioncommittee of the Council \u2013 It further indicates that the Fundamental Rules,1922 will have no direct application in cases where the governing bodyfi nalises the rules of superannuation \u2013 In terms of Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws,the governing body had decided the age of superannuation to be 60 yearson 01.12.1998 \u2013 The said decision was ratifi ed on 27.01.2000 - CAT rightly took the view that the plea canvassed on behalf of the respondent No.1 thatthe Council failed to consider the Clause 35 of the Bye-Laws which statesthat the FR, Supplementary Rule (SR) and General Financial Rules (GFR)as amended from time to time shall apply mutatis mutandis to employeesof the Council, was without any merit and deserved to be rejected \u2013 CATrightly rejected such argument because the applicability would be subjectto the provision specifi c to the Clause 34 governing superannuation of theemployees of the Council \u2013 There is nothing in Clause 35 of the Bye-Lawson the basis of which, it could be said that the same will have an overridingeff ect on Clause 34 as regards the age of retirement \u2013 Clause 47 of the Bye-Laws makes it abundantly clear that for the matters not specifi cally providedin the Bye-Laws, the rules applicable to the government employees wouldapply \u2013 However, as there is a specifi c provision regarding superannuationin Clause 34, the rules governing the government services in respect ofsuperannuation are not applicable to the employees of the Council unlessit is in accordance with Clause 34 of the Bye-Laws \u2013 Fundamental Rules,1922. [Paras 25, 28 and 29]Words and Phrases \u2013 \u201cor\u201d, \u201cand\u201d \u2013 Interpretation \u2013 Plea ofrespondent No.1 that clause 34 of the Bye-Laws should be read in twoparts- the fi rst part states that the Rules governing the retirement ofemployees of the Government of India as amended from time to timewould apply to the employees of the Central Council; the second partof Clause 34 which reads \u201cor as desired by the governing body\u201d ismerely an enabling provision empowering the governing body to takea decision whether an employee deserves to be retained beyond theprescribed age of superannuation and that such power should not beread in a negative form to clothe the governing body with the power toprescribe lesser age of superannuation than what has been prescribedby the Central Government from time to time:Held: Such argument cannot be accepted \u2013 The word \u201cor\u201d is normallydisjunctive and the word \u201cand\u201d is normally conjunctive \u2013 Both of themcan be read as vice-versa, but that interpretation is adopted only where theintention of the legislature is manifest \u2013 In the present case, the language ofClause 34 is very clear. What is important to note while reading the Clause34 is the word \u201cor\u201d \u2013 Thereafter, there is a proviso which says that an employee can be retained in service after prescribed age of superannuationif he continues to be physically fi t and effi cient and it is in the interest ofthe Central Counsel to retain him in the service \u2013 The expression \u201cthe rulesgoverning the retirement of employees of Government of India as amendedfrom time to time\u201d is separated from the rest of the part of the Bye-Law by theword \u201cor\u201d which is disjunctive and giving natural meaning to the said wordseparates the rules that may be framed by the Government of India and therules that the Council may desire to frame as regards the age of retirementof the employees of the Council \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes. [Paras 30-32]Service Law \u2013 Age of retirement vis-\u00e0-vis service conditionsrelating to pay and allowances and revision of pay \u2013 RespondentNo.1 contended that as the terms and conditions of the services of theemployees of the Council on all other aspects like the Provident Fund/GPF, Pension, Gratuity, Leave Rules, Scales of Pay, Conduct Rules andother conditions of services are the same as applicable to the employeesof the Central Government as set out in Clauses 31, 32, 33, 42, 44 and47 respectively of the Bye-Laws, the matter of age of superannuationof the respondent No. 1 should not be treated diff erently:Held: What should be the age of superannuation is a matter of policy\u2013 It is not within the domain of the court to legislate \u2013 It is only if a policydecision or a notifi cation is arbitrary it may invite the frowns of Article 14of the Constitution \u2013 The question of age of retirement stands on a diff erentfooting from the service conditions relating to pay and allowances andrevision of pay. [Para 35]Service Law \u2013 Claim of respondent No.1-Research Assistantthat his age of superannuation be at par with the AYUSH Doctors \u2013Infringement of Article 14 alleged:Held: It is too late in the day for the respondent No.1 to raise allsuch issues including infringement of Article 14 on the ground of artifi cialdistinction between the Research Assistant and AYUSH Doctors \u2013Respondent No.1 knew from the date of his appointment that he was beingappointed as a Research Assistant \u2013 His service conditions and mode ofrecruitment are diff erent compared to the AYUSH Doctors \u2013 It is a diff erentthing that he might have treated the patients but that by itself would not entitle him to claim that his age of superannuation should be at par with theAYUSH Doctors \u2013 Present case is not one of discrimination \u2013 Article 14 hasno application having regard to the facts of the present case \u2013 Constitutionof India \u2013 Article 14.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: Whether the prosecution could be said tohave proved its case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant whowas convicted for off ence punishable u/ss.302, 436 and 326-A, IPC andsentenced to death, for allegedly setting his son and his real brothers onfi re, solely on the basis of dying declarations.Evidence \u2013 Dying declarations \u2013 Sole basis of conviction \u2013 Whennot justifi ed \u2013 Appellant had strained relationship with his son (victimdeceased)from his first marriage and his two brothers (victimsdeceased),all of whom, as per the prosecution, were opposed to hissecond marriage \u2013 He is said to have locked the door of the room fromoutside in which the victims were sleeping, poured kerosene in the roomand set it on fi re \u2013 Dying declarations of two of the deceased personsrelied upon \u2013 Legality:Held: Courts are fi rst required to satisfy themselves that the dyingdeclaration in question is reliable and truthful before placing any relianceupon it \u2013 Dying declaration while carrying a presumption of being true mustbe wholly reliable and inspire confi dence \u2013 Where there is any suspicionover the veracity of the same or the evidence on record shows that the dyingdeclaration is not true it will only be considered as a piece of evidence butcannot be the basis for conviction alone \u2013 In the instant case, neither thetwo dying declarations nor the oral evidence of PW-2 and PW-4 inspire anyconfi dence \u2013 Both these witnesses do not fi gure in the two dying declarations The two dying declarations are not consistent or rather contradictory tothe oral evidence on record \u2013 Although, the appellant was named in the twodying declarations as a person who set the room on fi re yet the surroundingcircumstances render such statement very doubtful \u2013 Diffi cult to rest theconviction solely based on the two dying declarations \u2013 Prosecution has notproved its case against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 Appellantacquitted. [Paras 47, 61, 64, 67-69]Criminal Law \u2013 Charge against accused \u2013 Duty of prosecution toestablish beyond reasonable doubt:Held: It is the duty of the prosecution to establish the charge against theaccused beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 The benefi t of doubt must always go infavour of the accused \u2013 Dying declaration is a substantive piece of evidenceto be relied on provided it is proved that it was voluntary and truthful andthe victim was in a fi t state of mind \u2013 It is just not enough for the courtto say that the dying declaration is reliable as the accused is named in thedying declaration as the assailant \u2013 Evidence \u2013 Dying declaration. [Para 63]Evidence \u2013 Dying declaration \u2013 Acceptability \u2013 Theory:Held: The juristic theory regarding the acceptability of a dyingdeclaration is that such declaration is made in extremity, when the partyis at the point of death and when every hope of this world is gone, whenevery motive to falsehood is silenced, and the man is induced by the mostpowerful consideration to speak only the truth \u2013 Notwithstanding the same,great caution must be exercised in considering the weight to be given to iton account of the existence of many circumstances which may aff ect theirtruth \u2013 The situation in which a man is on the deathbed is so solemn andserene, is the reason in law to accept the veracity of his statement \u2013 It is forthis reason, the requirements of oath and cross-examination are dispensedwith \u2013 Since, the accused has no power of cross-examination, the courtsinsist that the dying declaration should be of such a nature as to inspire fullconfi dence of the court in its truthfulness and correctness \u2013 However, thecourt should always be on guard to see that the statement of the deceased wasnot as a result of either tutoring or prompting or a product of imagination.[Para 43] Evidence \u2013 Dying declaration \u2013 Reliance upon \u2013 Factors to beconsidered \u2013 Duty of the Court:Held: Despite a general consensus of presuming that the dyingdeclaration is true, they have not been stricto-sensu accepted, rather thegeneral course of action has been that judge decides whether the essentialsof a dying declaration are met and if it can be admissible, once done, it isupon the duty of the court to see the extent to which the dying declarationis entitled to credit \u2013 Thus, there is no hard and fast rule for determiningwhen a dying declaration should be accepted \u2013 Duty of the Court is to decidethis question in the facts and surrounding circumstances of the case and befully convinced of the truthfulness of the same \u2013 Factors to be considered,enumerated. [Paras 60 and 62]Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.8 \u2013 Conduct:The conduct of the accused may be unnatural because he was residingin the very same house, however, the conduct which may be a relevant factu/s.8, by itself may not be suffi cient to hold a person guilty of the off enceof murder \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.302. [Para 46]Evidence \u2013 Dying declaration \u2013 Sanctity/presumption attachedto \u2013 Justifi cation for:The justifi cation for the sanctity/presumption attached to a dyingdeclaration is two fold- (i) ethically and religiously it is presumed that aperson while at the brink of death will not lie, whereas (ii) from a publicpolicy perspective it is to tackle a situation where the only witness to thecrime is not available. [Para 64]Evidence \u2013 Dying declaration \u2013 Suspicion as regards correctnessof \u2013 Duty of Court:It is unsafe to record the conviction on the basis of a dying declarationalone in the cases where suspicion, like the case on hand is raised, as regardsthe correctness of the dying declaration \u2013 In such cases, the Court may haveto look for some corroborative evidence by treating the dying declarationonly as a piece of evidence \u2013 The evidence and material available on recordmust be properly weighed in each case to arrive at an appropriate conclusion.[Para 48]"

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: Appellant in fi t of rage, dashed head of thevictim against the wall, resulting in death of victim. Appellant convicted u/s.302 IPC and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment. Whether judgment,order and sentence passed by the Sessions Court and affi rmed by theHigh Court requires to be affi rmed or the sentence is to be converted andpunishment to be awarded u/s. 304 of IPC and if so, which part of s.304 IPC?Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.302 and 304 Part II \u2013 Limited question beforethe Supreme Court regarding the affi rmation of sentence u/s. 302 IPCor conversion of sentence to s.304 IPC:Held: In the instant case it can be noticed that appellant-convict andthe deceased were in love with each other \u2013 The fact that deceased hadstopped talking to the appellant and she was talking to her neighbour, hadmade the appellant furious and he was upset about this change of attitudeof the deceased \u2013 Even according to the testimony of PW-1 (mother of thedeceased), there was altercation between the appellant and the deceasedregarding their love aff air \u2013 Appellant got infuriated and in that spur of themoment he caught hold of her hair and banged her head to the wall whichresulted in blood oozing out and on seeing this he ran away from the sceneof the incident \u2013 Thus, the single assault by the appellant coupled with theduration of the entire period having occurred for about 2-3 minutes wouldnot be suffi cient to infer that he had the intention to kill the deceased \u2013 In thefacts of the case, it is discernible that there was no premeditation to causedeath or the genesis of occurrence and the single assault by the accused and duration of entire episode, were factors to adjudge the intention \u2013 Therefore,conviction of the appellant u/s. 302 is altered/converted to one u/s. 304 partII of the IPC and the appellant is sentenced to the imprisonment to the periodalready undergone and directed to be released forthwith. [Paras 20 and 21]Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 When accused can be held guilty u/s. 302 and304 Part-II of IPC:Held: Where the evidence would not disclose that there was anyintention to cause death of the deceased but it was clear that the accusedhad knowledge that his acts were likely to cause death, the accused canbe held guilty under second part of s.304 IPC \u2013 It is in this backgroundthat the expression used in Indian Penal Code namely \u201cintention\u201d and\u201cknowledge\u201d has to be seen as there being a thin line of distinction betweenthese two expressions \u2013 The act to constitute murder, if in given facts andcircumstances, would disclose that the ingredients of Section 300 are notsatisfi ed and such act is one of extreme recklessness, it would not attract thesaid Section \u2013 In order to bring a case within Part 3 of s.300 IPC, it mustbe proved that there was an intention to infl ict that particular bodily injurywhich in the ordinary course of nature was suffi cient to cause death.

        "HeadNote": "Issues for consideration:(i) Whether the High Court committed any error in dismissing theappeal fi led by the appellant convict and thereby affi rming the judgment andorder of conviction and sentence passed by the Trial Court for the allegedoff ences?;(ii) Whether an accused can decline to participate in the TIP on theground that he was already shown to the eye witnesses prior to the conductof the TIP and in such circumstances, the TIP would be nothing short ofcreating evidence against him?;(iii) Can an accused decline to participate in the TIP that theinvestigating offi cer may propose to hold in the course of investigationon the ground that no person accused of any off ence shall be compelledto be a witness against himself? To put it in other words, can an accuseddecline to subject himself to the TIP on the ground that the same violateshis fundamental right under Article 20(3) of the Constitution?;(iv) To what extent the Court can draw an adverse inference againstthe accused for having refused to participate in the TIP? Whether by virtueof drawing such adverse inference, is it open for the Court to accept thesubstantive evidence of identifi cation before the Trial Court without anycorroboration to such identifi cation?;(v) What is the true purport of Section 54A of the CrPC?; (vi) Whether the Courts below were justifi ed in placing reliance on thediscovery of weapon of off ence and the currency notes from the residenceof the appellant convict as one of the incriminating circumstances againstthe appellant convict?Test Identifi cation Parade \u2013 Whether an accused can decline toparticipate in the TIP on the ground that he was already shown to theeye witnesses prior to the conduct of the TIP:Held: The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act \u2013 It may be a positiveact and even a volitional act, but only to a limited extent, when the accusedis brought to the place where the TIP is to be held \u2013 It is certainly not hisevidentiary act \u2013 The accused concerned may have a legitimate ground toresist facing the TIP saying that the witnesses had a chance to see him eitherat the police station or in the Court, as the case may be, however, on suchground alone he cannot refuse to face the TIP \u2013 It is always open for theaccused to raise any legal ground available to him relating to the legitimacyof the TIP or the evidentiary value of the same in the course of the trial \u2013However, the accused cannot decline or refuse to join the TIP. [Para 35]Test Identifi cation Parade \u2013 Whether TIP violates the fundamentalright of an accused under Article 20(3) of the Constitution.Held: What is prohibited by Article 20(3) of the Constitution isprocuring by compulsion of the positive volitional evidentiary acts of anaccused \u2013 It is true that an accused may be said to be compelled to attend atest identifi cation parade, but this compulsion does not involve any positivevolitional evidentiary act \u2013 His mere attendance or the exhibition of hisbody at a test identifi cation parade even though compelled, does not resultin any evidentiary act until he is identifi ed by some other agency \u2013 Theidentifi cation of him by a witness is not his act, even though his body isexhibited for the purpose \u2013 If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him \u2013 However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application. [Paras 26 and 35] Test Identifi cation Parade \u2013 The test identifi cation parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court:Held: It is well settled that the substantive evidence is the evidenceof identification in court and the test identification parade providescorroboration to the identifi cation of the witness in court, if required \u2013However, what weight must be attached to the evidence of identifi cation incourt, which is not preceded by a test identifi cation parade, is a matter forthe courts of fact to examine. [Para 48]Test Identifi cation Parade \u2013 Where an accused himself refused toparticipate in the TIP:Held: In a case where an accused himself refused to participate in theTIP, it is not open to him to contend that the statement of the eye witnessesmade for the fi rst time in Court, wherein they specifi cally point towards himas a person who had taken part in the commission of the crime, should notbe relied upon \u2013 Such a plea is available provided the prosecution is itselfresponsible for not holding a TIP \u2013 However, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trialof the case. [Para 70]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.54A \u2013 Test Identifi cationParade \u2013 Obligation u/s. 54A CrPC:Held: The introduction of Section 54A in the CrPC, an accused isunder an obligation to stand for identifi cation parade \u2013 An accused cannotresist subjecting himself to the TIP on the ground that he cannot be forcedor coerced for the same \u2013 If the coercion is sought to be imposed in gettingfrom an accused evidence which cannot be procured save through positivevolitional act on his part, the constitutional guarantee as enshrined underArticle 20(3) of the Constitution will step in to protect him \u2013 However, ifthat evidence can be procured without any positive volitional evidentiaryact on the part of the accused, Article 20(3) of the Constitution will haveno application \u2013 The accused while subjecting himself to the TIP does notproduce any evidence or perform any evidentiary act. [Para 35] Test Identifi cation Parade \u2013 Importance and Evidentiary valueof TIP:Held: Facts which establish the identity of any person or thing whoseidentity is relevant are, by virtue of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, alwaysrelevant \u2013 The term \u2018identifi cation\u2019 means proving that a person, subjector article before the Court is the very same that he or it is alleged, chargedor reputed to be \u2013 Identifi cation is almost always a matter of opinion orbelief. [Para 37]Test Identifi cation Parade \u2013 Object of:Held: Before the investigating authorities send up a case to Court, theymust be satisfi ed that the persons arrested by them are the persons accusedof having committed the crime \u2013 If they were known to the witnesses, thewitnesses would have given their names and that would have established theiridentity, but when they were not known, their identity could be establishedonly if the witnesses on seeing them say that they are the off enders \u2013 Sinceit would be very easy for a witness who has little regard for truth, to say thatthe person arrested on suspicion was the off ender, he is confronted with thesuspect mixed with innocent men \u2013 If he picks him out, that would add tothe credibility of his statement that he was the off ender \u2013 This is the primaryobject of identification proceeding. [Paras 40 and 41]Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Trial Court convicted appellant-convict u/ss. 302, 392, 394, 397 and sentenced him imprisonment for life \u2013 HighCourt affirmed the conviction and sentence \u2013 Propriety:Held: Appellant-convict stated that the PW-1 was in a position toidentify him for the fi rst time before the Trial Court only because he had theopportunity to see him on 15.09.2008 \u2013 In such circumstances, it is arguedon behalf of the appellant convict that there is no evidence to hold him guiltyfor the alleged crime \u2013 However, the State stated that is not a suffi cient ora good ground to discard the substantive evidence of identifi cation beforethe Trial Court \u2013 Although the appellant convict in his further statementrecorded u/s. 313 CrPC stated that he had refused to participate in the TIPas the eye witnesses had already seen him, yet except a bald assertion, noother foundation was laid for offering such an explanation \u2013 It is a longsettled law that if a witness is trustworthy and reliable, the mere fact thatno identifi cation parade could be conducted and the appellant convict was identifi ed for the fi rst time before the Trial Court, would not be a reason todiscard the evidence of the witness \u2013 Further, in a case where the accusedhimself declines to participate in a TIP, the prosecution has no option but toproceed in a normal manner like all other cases and rely upon the testimonyof the witnesses, which is recorded in Court during the course of the trial ofthe case \u2013 In the instant case, the PW-1 in his fi rst statement had categoricallystated that he can identify assailants, if brought before him and while givingstatements he had identifi ed all four assailants in the Court and their roles inthe crime \u2013 Besides that, when the appellant was arrested, he is said to havemade a disclosure statement \u2013 The statement was one relating to the weaponof off ence i.e. ice pick which was ultimately discovered from his house \u2013 Theevidence of the circumstance, simpliciter, that the accused pointed out tothe police offi cer, the place where he had concealed the weapon of off encei.e. ice pick, would be admissible as conduct u/s. 8 irrespective of the factwhether the statement made by the appellant convict contemporaneouslywith or antecedent to such conduct falls within the purview of s.27 of theEvidence Act or not \u2013 There was no infirmity in the line of reasoning adoptedby the Trial Court as well as by the High Court in holding the appellantconvict guilty of the alleged crime.

[Paras 29, 39 and 40]Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 \u2013 Application of mind in the order of detentiondated 24.03.2023 \u2013 Proper or not:Held: The Detenu was earlier preventively detained under the Actvide order of detention dated 04.03.2021, since quashed by the High Courtby its order dated 16.08.2021 \u2013 The Commissioner stated that the presentorder of detention is based only on 5 (fi ve) out of these 9 (nine) crimes(years 2022-2023), which are alleged to show that the Detenu\u2019s activitiesare \u201cprejudicial to the maintenance of public order, apart from disturbingpeace and tranquillity in the area\u201d \u2013 The Commissioner sought to projectthat he ordered detention based on the said 5 (fi ve) FIRs, indication ofthe past off ences allegedly committed by the Detenu \u2013 However, with the quashing of the order of detention dated 04.03.2021 by the High Court andsuch direction having attained fi nality, it defi es logic why the Commissionerembarked on an elaborate narration of past off ences, which are not relevantto the grounds of the present order of detention \u2013 Since the aforesaid orderof the High Court went unchallenged and is, thus, binding upon the parties,it was not open to the Commissioner to refer to the very same antecedentoff ences again in the Detention Order under challenge \u2013 There was no directnexus or link with the immediate need to order detention and there wereextraneous considerations in the Detention Order. [Paras 43, 46 and 48]Preventive detention \u2013 Ordinary criminal law and extraordinarymeasure of law of preventive detention:Held: In the instant case, it is neither the case of the respondents thatthe Detenu had not complied with the terms of the notice issued u/s. 41-Aof the Cr. PC, nor has it been alleged that the conditions of bail had beenviolated by the Detenu \u2013 It is pertinent to note that in the three criminalproceedings where the Detenu had been released on bail, no applications forcancellation of bail had been moved by the State \u2013 In the light of the same,the provisions of the Act, which is an extraordinary statute, should not havebeen resorted to when ordinary criminal law provided suffi cient means toaddress the apprehensions leading to the impugned Detention Order \u2013 Theremay have existed suffi cient grounds to appeal against the bail orders, butthe circumstances did not warrant the circumvention of ordinary criminalprocedure to resort to an extraordinary measure of the law of preventivedetention. [Para 51]Preventive detention \u2013 Guidance for detaining authorities \u2013 Orderto be in plain and simple language:Held: There is no requirement in law of orders of detention beingexpressed in language that would normally be considered elegant or artistic\u2013 An order of detention, which is capable of comprehension, has to preciselyset forth the grounds of detention without any vagueness \u2013 The substance ofthe order and how it is understood by the detenu determines its nature \u2013 Anorder in plain and simple language providing clarity of how the subjectivesatisfaction was formed is what a detenu would look for, since the detenuhas a right to represent against the order of detention and claim that suchorder should not have been made at all. [Para 49] Telangana Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Bootleggers,Dacoits, Drug-Off enders, Goondas, Immoral Traffi c Off enders, LandGrabbers, Spurious Seed Off enders, Insecticide Off enders, FertiliserOff enders, Food Adulteration Off enders, Fake Document Off enders,Scheduled Commodities Offenders, Forest Offenders, GamingOff enders, Sexual Off enders, Explosive Substances Off enders, ArmsOff enders, Cyber Crime Off enders and White Collar or FinancialOff enders Act 1986 \u2013 Role of the Advisory Board and the Governmentin the period of detention:Held: It is one thing to say that the Advisory Board has expressed anopinion that there is suffi cient cause for the detention and, therefore, thedetention has been continued; yet, it is quite another thing to say that thedetention should continue for the maximum permissible period \u2013 In thelight of sub-section (2) of section 11 read with sub-section (1) of section 12of the Act, the period for which the detention should continue is left to bespecifi ed by the Government with the stipulation in section 13 thereof thatthe maximum period shall be 12 (twelve) months from the date of detention\u2013 This appears on a plain reading of the relevant statutory provisions \u2013 Theduration for which a detenu is to be kept in detention is for the detainingauthority to decide and not the Advisory Board \u2013 The period of detention andthe terminal point has, therefore, to be decided by the Government.

[Paras63 and 70]Preventive detention \u2013 Judicial reviewability \u2013 The Courts totest the legality of orders of preventive detention, when called upon toexamine the same :Held: In the circumstances of a given case, a Constitutional Courtwhen called upon to test the legality of orders of preventive detentionwould be entitled to examine whether: (i) the order is based on the requisitesatisfaction, albeit subjective, of the detaining authority, for, the absence ofsuch satisfaction as to the existence of a matter of fact or law, upon whichvalidity of the exercise of the power is predicated, would be the sine quanon for the exercise of the power not being satisfi ed; (ii) in reaching suchrequisite satisfaction, the detaining authority has applied its mind to allrelevant circumstances and the same is not based on material extraneousto the scope and purpose of the statute; (iii) power has been exercisedfor achieving the purpose for which it has been conferred, or exercisedfor an improper purpose, not authorised by the statute, and is thereforeultra vires; (iv) the detaining authority has acted independently or underthe dictation of another body; (v) the detaining authority, by reason ofself-created rules of policy or in any other manner not authorized by thegoverning statute, has disabled itself from applying its mind to the facts ofeach individual case; (vi) the satisfaction of the detaining authority restson materials which are of rationally probative value, and the detainingauthority has given due regard to the matters as per the statutory mandate;(vii) the satisfaction has been arrived at bearing in mind existence of alive and proximate link between the past conduct of a person and theimperative need to detain him or is based on material which is stale; (viii)the ground(s) for reaching the requisite satisfaction is/are such which anindividual, with some degree of rationality and prudence, would consideras connected with the fact and relevant to the subject-matter of the inquiryin respect whereof the satisfaction is to be reached; (ix) the grounds onwhich the order of preventive detention rests are not vague but are precise,pertinent and relevant which, with sufficient clarity, inform the detenu the satisfaction for the detention, giving him the opportunity to make asuitable representation; and (x) the timelines, as provided under the law,have been strictly adhered to. [Para 25]Constitution of India \u2013 Preventive detention \u2013 Reckless invocationof:Held: It requires no serious debate that preventive detention, conceivedas an extraordinary measure by the framers of the Constitution, has beenrendered ordinary with its reckless invocation over the years as if it wereavailable for use even in the ordinary course of proceedings \u2013 To unchainthe shackles of preventive detention, it is important that the safeguardsenshrined in the Constitution, particularly under the \u2018golden triangle\u2019 formedby Articles 14, 19 and 21, are diligently enforced.

[Para 46] Practice and Procedure \u2013 Criminal Law \u2013 Duty of Presiding Judge\u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.165:Held: In many sessions cases when an advocate appointed by theCourt appears and particularly when a junior advocate not having muchexperience of the procedure of the Court, has been appointed to conductthe defence of an accused person, it is the duty of the Presiding Judge todraw his attention to the statutory provisions of s.145, Evidence Act \u2013 NoCourt should allow a witness to be contradicted by reference to the previousstatement in writing or reduced to writing unless the procedure set out ins.145, Evidence Act has been followed \u2013 It is possible that if the attention ofthe witness is drawn to these portions with reference to which it is proposedto contradict him, he may be able to give a perfectly satisfactory explanationand in that event the portion in the previous statement which would otherwisebe contradictory would no longer go to contradict or challenge the testimonyof the witness \u2013 In a case like the present one, where the evidence given inCourt implicates persons who not mentioned in the FIR or police statements,it is always advisable and far more important for the Trial Judge to look intothe police papers in order to ascertain whether the persons implicated bywitnesses, at the trial had been implicated by them during the investigation.[Paras 47 and 48]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.53(1), 53A \u2013 Medicalexamination \u2013 Importance \u2013 Circumstantial evidence \u2013 Rape victimdead:Held: s.53(1) enables a police offi cer not below the rank of subinspectorto request a registered medical practitioner, to make such anexamination of the person arrested, as is reasonably necessary to ascertainthe facts which may aff ord such evidence, whenever a person is arrested ona charge of committing an off ence of such a nature that there are reasonablegrounds for believing that an examination of his person will aff ord evidenceas to the commission of an off ence \u2013 By Amendment Act 25 of 2005, a newExplanation was substituted u/s.53, in the place of the original Explanation\u2013 Simultaneously with the substitution of a new Explanation u/s.53, Act25 of 2005 also inserted a new provision i.e. s.53A \u2013 Medical examinationof an accused assumes great importance in cases where the victim of rapeis dead and the off ence is sought to be established only by circumstantialevidence \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss.302, 376 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure(Amendment) Act, 2005. [Paras 25-27 and 29] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.313 \u2013 Additionalcircumstances relied upon, not put to the appellant \u2013 Impropriety:Held: The further statement of the appellant-convict was recordedu/s. 313 \u2013 It was shocking to see the manner in which the Trial Court recordedthe same \u2013 In all, four questions were put to the appellant to enable him toexplain the incriminating circumstances pointing towards his complicity inthe alleged crime \u2013 However, for holding the appellant guilty of the allegedcrime, the Trial Court looked into the additional circumstances none ofwhich were put to the appellant so that he could off er a proper explanationto the same. [Para 32]Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.145, 161 \u2013 Duty of defence counsel, publicprosecutor:Held: It was the duty of the defence counsel to confront the witnesseswith their police statements so as to prove the contradictions in the formof material omissions and bring them on record \u2013 The defence counsel hadno idea how to contradict a witness with his or her police statements inaccordance w/s.145, Evidence Act \u2013 Lapse on the part of public prosecutoris also very unfortunate \u2013 The public prosecutor knew that the witnesseswere deposing something contrary to what they had stated before the policein their statements recorded u/s.161 \u2013 It was his duty to bring to the noticeof the witnesses and confront them with the same even without declaringthem as hostile \u2013 If the witness was not confronted with that part of thestatement with which the defence wanted to contradict him, then the Courtcannot suo motu make use of statements to police not proved in compliancew/s.145, Evidence Act \u2013 Therefore, it is of utmost importance to proveall major contradictions in the form of material omissions in accordancewith the procedure as established u/s.145, Evidence Act and bring them onrecord \u2013 It is the duty of the defence counsel to do so . [Paras 41 and 50]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Chapter XXVIII- ss.366-371; Chapter XXIX- ss.372-394 \u2013 Role and duty of High Court inconfi rmation cases:Held: Power to acquit the person can be exercised by the High Courteven without there being any substantive appeal on the part of the accusedchallenging his conviction \u2013 To that extent, the proceedings under ChapterXXVIII which deal with \u201csubmission of death sentences for confirmation\u201d is a proceeding in continuation of the trial \u2013 ss.367, 368 entitle the HighCourt to direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and the HighCourt may, in a given case, even acquit the accused person \u2013 Scope ofthe chapter is wider \u2013 Chapter XXIX deals with \u201cAppeals\u201d \u2013 s.391 alsoentitles the appellate court to take further evidence or direct such furtherevidence to be taken \u2013 s.386 then enumerates powers of the appellate courtwhich inter alia includes the power to \u201creverse the fi nding and sentenceand acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a courtof competent jurisdiction subordinate to such appellate court or committedfor trial\u201d \u2013 Powers of the appellate court are equally wide \u2013 The High Courtin the present case was exercising powers both u/Chapters XXVIII andXXIX, CrPC \u2013 ss.367, 368 make it clear that the duty of the High Court, indealing with the reference, is not only to see whether the order passed bythe Sessions Judge is correct, but to examine the case for itself and evendirect a further enquiry or the taking of additional evidence if considereddesirable in order to ascertain the guilt or the innocence of the convictedperson. [Paras 58 and 59]Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss.367, 368 and proviso thereto\u2013 Duty of High Court u/s.367:Held: Under the proviso to s.368, no order of confi rmation is to bemade until the period allowed for preferring the appeal has expired, or, ifan appeal is presented within such period, until such appeal is disposedof, so that, if an appeal is fi led by a condemned prisoner, that appeal hasto be disposed of before any order is made in the reference confi rming thesentence of death \u2013 In disposing of such an appeal, however, it is necessarythat the High Court should keep in view its duty u/s.367 \u2013 It must examinethe appeal record for itself, arrive at a view whether a further enquiryor taking of additional evidence is desirable or not, and then come to itsown conclusion on the entire material on record whether conviction ofthe condemned prisoner is justifi ed and the sentence of death should beconfi rmed. [Para 59]Criminal Law \u2013 Criminal justice system \u2013 Accusatorial/adversarialsystem:Held: For the dispensation of criminal justice, India follows theaccusatorial or adversarial system of common law \u2013 In the accusatorial or adversarial system, the accused is presumed to be innocent; prosecution anddefence each put their case; judge acts as an impartial umpire and whileacting as a neutral umpire sees whether the prosecution has been able toprove its case beyond reasonable doubt or not. [Para 66]Constitution of India \u2013 Article 21 \u2013 Free and fair trial, a sine-quanon:Held: Free and fair trial is sine-qua-non of Article 21 \u2013 If the criminaltrial is not free and fair, then the confi dence of the public in the judicialfairness of a judge and the justice delivery system would be shaken \u2013 Denialto fair trial is as much injustice to the accused as to the victim and the society\u2013 No trial can be treated as a fair trial unless there is an impartial judgeconducting the trial, an honest, able and fair defence counsel and equallyhonest, able and fair public prosecutor \u2013 A fair trial necessarily includes fairand proper opportunity to the prosecutor to prove the guilt of the accusedand opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence.
