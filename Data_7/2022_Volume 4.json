Balbir Singh Turn, in which case it was held that the ArmedForces Personnel had to be given benefit of MACP from the date ofthe recommendation of the Sixth Central Pay Commission i.e. from01.01.2006 and not from 1.09.2008 as decided by the CentralGovernment and therefore upon the same logic, in the instant casethe MACP shall come into effect from 01.01.2006 \u2013 Held: None ofthe employees actually earned a second financial up-gradation,though they undoubtedly became eligible for consideration but theeligibility does not ipso facto translate into entitlement as per thescheme of the ACP and therefore second ACP up-gradation wasnot automatic but dependent on external factors, eg. employees\u2019record \u2013 The contention of the employees that they had vested rightis not tenable as benefit under the ACP scheme was by way ofincentive granted to avoid stagnation with respect to those employeewho could not get promoted for an ascertained period of time \u2013Such benefit by way of incentive are not embodied under rules butis in the form of executive order and since MACP is aimed to benefita sizable section of the employees, and not only the respondent, asin this case, hence the same cannot be interfered with.Service Law: Assured Career Progression Scheme \u2013 PolicyBehind Financial Up-Gradation \u2013 Financial up-gradation underthe ACP Scheme was available only if regular promotion during thestipulated intervals, 12 years and 24 years, was not granted to anemployee \u2013 Its intent was to extend relief for stagnation faced byemployees\u2019 due inadequate promotional probabilities \u2013 A singularfeature of the ACP scheme was that while the benefit was pay based,the employee had to fulfil the prescribed criteria to be eligible forthe benefits.Service Law: Modified Assured Career Progression Scheme\u2013 Essential features and distinction from \u2013 Held: Assured CareerProgression Scheme \u2013 Distinction \u2013 The noticeable feature of theMACP Scheme is that three increments are to be granted to employeeson completion of 10, 20 and 30 years of service \u2013 According to theMACP scheme, financial up-gradation is admissible on completionof 10 years of continuous service -in the same grade pay \u2013 Thedistinction between the ACP and the MACP scheme is not only withrespect to the number of benefits (i.e., two under the ACP scheme,and three under the MACP scheme) but also that the former assuredthe promotional grade, where the latter (MACP scheme) only assuredhigher pay.Delhi Development Authority \u2013 Scope of Application of MACPupon its employees \u2013 DDA is an autonomous \u2013 statutory-organization\u2013 It largely follows the Central Government\u2019s policies, in respect ofpay and allowances, and other benefits for its employees, however,any revision of pay-structure or revision in other terms andconditions, of Central Government personnel cannot and do notautomatically apply to the DDA \u2013 It has to consider the new orfresh scheme formulated by the Central Government, and adopt it,if necessary, after appropriate adaptation, to suit its needs."

Adequate sentence \u2013 Imposition of \u2013 Principles of proportionality \u2013 Held: There is necessity of maintaining a reasonable proportion between the seriousness of the crime and punishment \u2013 While disproportionately severe sentence ought not to be passed, simultaneously it also does not clothe the courts to award an inadequate sentence, having due regard to the nature of the offence, since an inadequate sentence would fail to produce a deterrent effect on the society at large.

No.7590/ 2021, traded on basis of UPSI received by them on account of their alleged proximity to P.C.

No.7590 of 2021 \u2013 Rejected by Whole Time Member (WTM) of SEBI and also the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) \u2013 Held: WTM and SAT wrongly rejected the claim of estrangement without appreciating the facts and evidence produced before them \u2013 The records and facts adequately establish that the there was a breakdown of ties between the parties, both at personal and professional level and that the said estrangement happened much prior to the two UPSI \u2013 Appellants are neither \u201cconnected persons\u201d under regulations 2(1)(d) nor \u201cimmediate relatives\u201d under 2(1)(f) \u2013 Even assuming that the family arrangements did not result in complete estrangement of social relations between the parties, the SAT could not, by virtue of this very fact, discharge SEBI of the onus of proof placed on them to prove that Appellants were in possession of UPSI \u2013 SEBI failed to place on record any material to prove that appellants in C.A.

No.7590/2021, traded on basis of UPSI received by them on account of their alleged proximity to P.C. Gupta and \u2018B\u2019 in view of close family relationship \u2013 Whether appellants in C.A.

No.7590 of 2021 cannot be the circumstantial evidence to prove the communication of UPSI to them by appellant \u2018B\u2019 \u2013 There was no correlation between the UPSI and the sale of shares undertaken by the appellants in C.A. No.7590 of 2021 \u2013 Decisions of selling the shares and the timings thereof were purely a personal and commercial decision undertaken by them and nothing more can be read into those decisions \u2013 In absence of any material available on record to show frequent communication between the parties, there could not have been a presumption of communication of UPSI by appellant \u2018B\u2019 \u2013 SAT erred in holding the appellants in C.A.

Dahrawka \u2013 It found that her right to inheritance in the instant dispute was safeguarded by the Customary Law in the absence of descendants having a better right for the purpose \u2013 The District Council Court therefore found that taking into consideration the principle of Mizo Customary Law of Inheritance and the spirit of equity, which is paramount to Mizo Customary Law, it was appropriate that the property be divided between appellant No.4 and respondent No.3 \u2013 The view taken by the District Council Court, on second remand, was based on the consideration of equity and the responsibility of a legal heir to look after the elders in the family \u2013 High Court was not justified in reversing the order of District Council Court.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.482 \u2013 Quashing of proceedings at preliminary stage \u2013 Propriety of \u2013 Held: The Court should be slow to grant the relief of quashing a complaint at a pre- trial stage, when the factual controversy is in the realm of possibility particularly because of the legal presumption, as in this matter \u2013 The factual defence without having to adduce any evidence need to be of an unimpeachable quality, so as to altogether disprove the allegations made in the complaint\u2013 The consequences of scuttling the criminal process at a pre-trial stage can be grave and irreparable \u2013 Quashing proceedings at preliminary stages will result in finality without the parties having had an opportunity to adduce evidence and the consequence then is that the proper forum i.e., the trial Court is ousted from weighing the material evidence \u2013 If this is allowed, the accused may be given an un-merited advantage in the criminal process \u2013 Also because of the legal presumption, when the cheque and the signature are not disputed by the appellant, the balance of convenience at this stage is in favour of the complainant/ prosecution, as the accused will have due opportunity to adduce defence evidence during the trial, to rebut the presumption\u2013 Situated thus, to non-suit the complainant, at the stage of the summoning order, when the factual controversy is yet to be canvassed and considered by the trial court will not be judicious\u2013 Based upon a prima facie impression, an element of criminality cannot entirely be ruled out here subject to the determination by the trial Court\u2013 Therefore, when the proceedings are at a nascent stage, scuttling of the criminal process is not merited.

Union of India the government may request the presiding judge to consider the matter afresh \u2013 In the present case, there is nothing to indicate that the presiding judge took into account the factors which have been laid down in Laxman Naskar \u2013 Thus, an opinion accompanied by inadequate reasoning would not satisfy the requirements of s. 432 (2) of the CrPC \u2013 Further, it will not serve the purpose for which the exercise u/s. 432 (2) is to be undertaken, which is to enable the executive to make an informed decision taking into consideration all the relevant factors \u2013 Hence, the petitioner\u2019s application for remission should be re- considered \u2013 Special Judge is directed to provide an opinion on the application afresh accompanied by adequate reasoning that takes into consideration all the relevant factors that govern the grant of remission as laid down in Laxman Naskar.
