Judicial deprecation: Summoning of public officers \u2013 Practice developed wherein certain High Courts calling public officers frequently to court \u2013 Held: Summoning of officers frequently is not appreciable at all \u2013 Same is condemned in the strongest words \u2013 Line of separation of powers between Judiciary and Executive is sought to be crossed by summoning the officers and in a way pressurizing them to pass an order as per the whims and fancies of the Court \u2013 Public officers of the Executive are also performing their duties as the third limbs of the governance \u2013 Public officers should not be called to court unnecessarily \u2013 Dignity and majesty of the Court is not enhanced when an officer is called to court \u2013 Summoning of the officer is against the public interest as many important tasks entrusted to him gets delayed."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.202 \u2013 Plea of appellant that before taking cognizance of offence on complaint, Magistrate has not followed the procedure, contemplated under s.24(4) of the Insecticides Act and s.202 Cr.PC and that though the appellants are not residing within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, the cognizance of offence was taken without making proper inquiry and ordering investigation \u2013 Held: The legislature in its wisdom has itself placed the public servant on a different pedestal, as isevident from a perusal of proviso to s.200 of the Code \u2013 Object of holding an inquiry/investigation before taking cognizance, in cases where accused resides outside the territorial jurisdiction of such Magistrate, is to ensure that innocents are not harassed unnecessarily \u2013 By virtue of proviso to s.200 of Code, the Magistrate, while taking cognizance, need not record statement of such public servant, who has filed the complaint in discharge of his official duty \u2013 Further, by virtue of s.293 of Code, report of the Government Scientific Expert is, per se, admissible in evidence \u2013 The Code of Criminal Procedure itself provides for exemption from examination of such witnesses, when the complaint is filed by a public servant \u2013 In the instant case, the second Respondent/Public Servant, in exercise of powers under provisions of the Insecticides Act, 1968 had filed complaint enclosing several documents including reports of the Government Laboratories, therefore, it was always open for the Magistrate to issue process on such complaint which was supported by documents \u2013 In any event, there is no merit in the submissions that proceedings are to be quashed only on the ground that, the Magistrate has taken cognizance without conducting inquiry and ordering investigation \u2013 In absence of showing any prejudice caused to the appellant at this stage, the same is no ground to quash the proceedings in exercise of power under s.482 of the Code \u2013 Insecticides Act, 1968: ss.24(4). 33."

Union of India (2006) 8 SCC 457 would apply and interest on solatium could be granted only from the date of the judgment of Supreme Court in Sunder v. Union of India (2001) 7 SCC 211 i.e. 19-09-2001 \u2013 Held: In the Award passed, it is clear that interest is not seen granted on solatium \u2013 What is granted is only solatium \u2013 The judgment of the High Court in appeal carried by the 1st respondent, therein also, it is clear that the High Court has not granted interest on solatium \u2013 Therefore, it is a case which must be dealt with in terms of the declaration of law made in Gurpreet Singh, which held that \u201cBut if the award of the Reference Court or that of the appellate court does not specifically refer to the question of interest on solatium or in cases where claim had not been made and rejected either expressly or impliedly by the Reference Court or the appellate court, and merely interest on compensation is awarded, then it would be open to the execution court to apply the ratio of Sunder and say that the compensation awarded includes solatium and in such an event interest on the amount could be directed to be deposited in execution. Otherwise, not. We also clarify that such interest on solatium can be claimed only in pending executions and not in closed executions and the execution court will be entitled to permit its recovery from the date of the judgment in Sunder (19-09-2001) and not for anyprior period\u201d\u2013 Thus, it is ordered that the 1st respondent will be entitled to interest on solatium from the date of Sunder v. Union of India viz. 19-09-2001 \u2013 Accordingly, appeals are allowed."

Criminal law: Alibi \u2013 Plea of \u2013 Effect on investigation \u2013 Held: At times persons committing a crime, themselves lodge the first information, to create an alibi of innocence \u2013 However, in such cases the investigation would normally proceed first against those named as accused in the FIR and, thereafter, the suspicion mayConstitution of India: Art. 142 \u2013 Power under \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Benefit of the instant appeal to co-accused who has not come up on appeal \u2013 Denial of \u2013 Held: Denial of the benefit of the conclusion of the matter in the appeal, to the said co-accused merely on the ground of a technicality that he is not on appeal would be gross injustice, when this Court is empowered u/Art. 142 to do complete justice \u2013 On facts, this Court has not proceeded on the basis of individual overt acts on the part of accused in appeal, to conclude that they are entitled to acquittal \u2013 Thus, conviction and sentence of the co-accused also set aside."

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Order VIII, r.6A \u2013 Counter- claim by defendant \u2013 Tenability \u2013 Held: It is true that as per Order VIII Rule 6A CPC, a defendant in a suit may, in addition to his right of pleading a set-off under rule 6, set up, by way of counter-claimagainst the claim of the plaintiff, any right or claim in respect of a cause of action accruing to the defendant against the plaintiff either before or after the filing of the suit but before the defendant has delivered his defence or before the time limited for delivering his defence has expired, whether such counter-claim is in the nature of a claim for damages or not \u2013 However, in the present case, according to appellant-wife (defendant), the cause for counter claim (in divorce proceedings initiated by the husband) had accrued after she had delivered her defence (written statement) and more particularly when during cross-examination of the plaintiff (respondent-husband) the factum of marriage with another woman was admitted and the marriage certificate was produced \u2013 High Court, therefore, was not justified in refusing to allow the counter claim proposed by appellant-wife (defendant) \u2013 Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 \u2013 s.23A. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Order VI Rule 17, proviso \u2013 Amendment of pleadings \u2013 Restrictions as per proviso to Order VI Rule 17 \u2013 When not applicable \u2013 Held: It is clear from the proviso to Order VI Rule 17 that no application for amendment shall be allowed after the trial has commenced unless the court comes to the conclusion that in spite of due diligence the party could not have raised the matter before the commencement of trial \u2013 Therefore, if some facts have come to the knowledge subsequently and subsequent to the commencement of trial, may be during the course of trial and if it is found that it is necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, on a fair reading of Order VI Rule 17 CPC, such an application for amendment can be allowed even after the trial has commenced \u2013 Pleadings \u2013 Amendment."

Act and since no notice of change was given, the transfer orders were in violation of s.9A of the I.D. Act \u2013 Labour Court also specifically found on appreciation of evidence that transfer would change the nature of work since the workmen were employed as labourers at Dewas and on transfer at Chopanki, they would be working as Supervisor \u2013 Employer- management unsuccessfully challenged order of Labour Court before the High Court \u2013 Hence instant appeal \u2013 Held: The order transferring the respective workmen from Dewas to Chopanki at about 900 Kms. away was in violation of s.9A read with Fourth Schedule of the ID Act and was arbitrary, mala fide and victimization \u2013 By such transfer, their status as \u201cworkman\u201d would change to that of \u201csupervisor\u201d \u2013 Thus, by such a change after their transfer to Chopanki and after they work as supervisor they would be deprived of the beneficial provisions of the ID Act and, therefore, the nature of service conditions/service would be changed \u2013 Even from the judgment and award passed by the Labour Court as well as the impugned judgment and order passed by the Single Judge, it can be seen that the appellant/employer has failed to justify the transfer from Dewas to Chopanki, which is at a distance of 900 Kms. and that too at the fag end of their service career \u2013 Every aspect was dealt with and considered in detail by the Labour Court as well as by the Single Judge of the High Court."

Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967: Grant of bail by Special court for NIA cases to accused no. 1 and 2 \u2013 Challenge against \u2013 FIR registered against accused 1 to 3 for offences punishable under ss. 20, 38 and 39 of unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 \u2013 Investigation was transferred to National Investigation Agency (NIA) established under the NIA Act \u2013 Accused no. 3 was absconding \u2013 Charge-sheet filed by NIA against accused no. 1 and 2 under ss. 38 and 39 of 1967 Act as well as under s.120-B IPC \u2013 Special Court allowed bail application of accused no. 1 and 2 \u2013 On State appeal, High Court set aside bail granted to accused no. 2 while upholding bail granted to accused no. 1 \u2013 Hence instant appeal by accused no. 2 as well as by State \u2013 Held: Mere association with a terrorist organisation is not sufficient to attract s.38 and mere support given to a terrorist organisation is not sufficient to attract s.39 \u2013 The association and the support have to be with intention of furthering the activities of a terrorist organisation \u2013 In a given case, such intention can be inferred from the overt acts or acts of active participation of the accused in the activities of a terrorist organization which are borne out from the materials forming a part of charge sheet \u2013 At formative young age, the accused nos.1 and 2 might have been fascinated by what is propagated by CPI (Maoist) \u2013 Therefore, they may be in possession of various documents/books concerning CPI (Maoist) in soft or hard form \u2013 Apart from the allegation that certain photographs showing that the accused participated in a protest/gathering organised by an organisation allegedly linked with CPI (Maoist), prima facie there is no material in the charge sheet to project their active participation in the activities of CPI (Maoist) \u2013 Order of Special Court granting bail to accused no.2 is restored. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967: s.43D \u2013 For deciding the issue of prima facie case contemplated by sub-section (5) of s.43D, the case against the both accused only under ss.38 and 39 is required to be considered \u2013 In view of the absence of sanction and the fact that NIA did not even seek sanction for the offence punishable under s.20, a prima facie case of the accused being involved in the said offence is not made out at this stage \u2013 Sub-section (5) of s.43D will not apply to s.13, as s.13 has been incorporated in Chapter III of the 1967 Act. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967: s.43D \u2013 The restrictions imposed by sub-section (5) of s.43D per se do not prevent a Constitutional Court from granting bail on the ground of violation of Part III of the Constitution."

Consumer Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 s.24A \u2013 Cause of action \u2013 Held: s.24A indicates that the complaint is required to be filed withintwo years from the date on which the cause of action arises \u2013 Cause of action will remain flexible and is to be gathered from the facts of each case \u2013 In the present case, though the cause of action arose for the first time when the fire broke out but it did not remain static at that point \u2013 As the matter kept oscillating, fresh cause of action arose \u2013 On facts, complaint filed was within time \u2013 Consideration of the same on merits by NCDRC justified. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 Insurance Claim \u2013 Surveyors report, reliance on \u2013 Held: Surveyors report is the basic document which has statutory recognition \u2013 It can be relied upon if it inspires confidence of adjudicating forum and if on facts, the forum does not find the need to place reliance on any other material."

Matter pertaining to ceiling proceedings \u2013 Jurisdiction of civil court to entertain the suit \u2013 Exclusion of \u2013 On facts, first respondent sought a declaration in regard to the legality of the auction conducted by the Development Authority and the injunction \u2013 Plea that the purpose of the suit was to impugn the validity of proceedings under ULCRA \u2013 Held: ULCRA impliedly excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court on matters arising out of the ceiling proceedings \u2013 First respondent artfully drafted the plaint to challenge the validity of the auction and sought an injunction and declaration, when the substantive cause of action of the suit arises out of the land ceiling proceedings \u2013 Real object and purpose of the suit, in the guise or pretext of challenging the auction notice by the Development Authority was to affirm the title of the first respondent on the basis of an alleged permission obtained for the sale of the property \u2013 By a process of engineered drafting, the first respondent sought no reliefs in regard to the proceedings under the ULCRA (to obviate a bar to the maintainability of the suit) and did not implead either the State or the Competent Authority who would have been in a position to answer the challenge \u2013 Courts below failed to correctly assess the issue regarding the jurisdiction of the civil court to try a suit, which in its essence, arises out of matters pertaining to the ULCRA \u2013 This Court, has warned against drafting of this nature which seeks to distract attention away from the real cause of action \u2013 Thus, the jurisdiction of the trial court to entertain the suit instituted by the first respondent was barred \u2013 Judicial deprecation.Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Ord. XLI r. 22 \u2013 Filing of cross-objections \u2013 Explained. Ord. XLI r. 22 \u2013 Plea that a party, in whose favour the civil court has decreed a suit, can raise arguments against findings without having to file a cross-objection, in the appeal \u2013 Held: Only when a part of the decree has been assailed by the respondent,should a memorandum of cross-objection be filed, otherwise, it is sufficient to raise a challenge to an adverse finding of the court of first instance before the appellate court without a cross objection \u2013 It is not necessary that a challenge to the adverse findings of the lower court needs to be made in the form of a memorandum of cross-objection. Constitution of India: Art. 136 \u2013 Raising of new ground before Supreme Court in special leave petition \u2013 Permissibility of \u2013 Held: Under Ord. 21 r. 3(c) of the 2013 Rules, SLPs are to be confined to the pleadings before the court whose order is challenged \u2013 However, with the leave of the Court, additional grounds can be urged at the time of the hearing \u2013 Though the appellant did not assail the finding of the trial court on the issue of jurisdiction before the High Court u/Ord. XLI r. 22 CPC either by filing a memorandum of cross- objection or otherwise, he is not precluded from raising the argument before this Court \u2013 This Court in view of its plenary jurisdiction u/ Art. 136 read with Art. 142 can entertain new grounds raised for the first time if it involves a question of law which does not require adducing additional evidence, specifically one concerning jurisdiction of the court which goes to the root of the matter \u2013 Supreme Court Rules 2013 \u2013 Ord. 21 r. 3(c) \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Ord.

Interpretation of statutes: Construction/interpretation of statutory provision \u2013 Held: Legislative intent of the statute is to be seen from the words used by the legislature itself \u2013 In case of doubt it is always safe to look into the object and purpose of the statute or the reason and spirit behind it \u2013 Each word, phrase or sentence has to be construed in the light of the general purpose of the Act itself."
