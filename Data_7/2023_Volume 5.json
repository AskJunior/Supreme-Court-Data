the Tribunal (NCLT), either suomotu or on an application made to it by the Central Government orby any person concerned, to take action against the auditor whohas acted in a fraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding infraud with the management of a company \u2013 If on completion of anenquiry it is found by the Tribunal that an auditor of a companyhas, whether directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner orabetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the companyor its directors or officers, it may by order direct the company tochange its auditors \u2013 By the impugned judgment, the High Courtheld that once the auditor resigns as an auditor or is no more anauditor on his resignation, thereafter s.140(5) proceedings are nolonger maintainable \u2013 Whether after resignation of the auditors,proceedings u/s.140(5) are maintainable \u2013 Held: The view taken bythe High Court is absolutely erroneous and is unsustainable \u2013Application / proceedings u/s.140(5) of the Act, 2013 is maintainableeven after the resignation of the concerned auditors \u2013 Enquiry/proceedings initiated under the first part of s.140(5) has to go to itslogical end and subsequent resignation and/or discontinuance ofan auditor shall not terminate the enquiry/proceedings u/s.140(5)\u2013 If interpretation given by High Court that once an auditor resigns,proceedings u/s.140(5) stand terminated and are no longer furtherrequired to be proceeded, in that case, an auditor to avoid the finalorder and the consequence of final order as provided under thesecond proviso to s.140(5) may resign and avoid any final order bythe Tribunal \u2013 That cannot be the intention of the legislature \u2013 NCLTto pass final order on such application after holding enquiry inaccordance with law and thereafter on basis of such final order, further consequences as provided under second proviso to s.140(5)shall follow.Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.140(5) \u2013 Constitutional validity of\u2013 s.140(5) empowers the Tribunal (NCLT), either suo motu or on anapplication made to it by the Central Government or by any personconcerned, to take action against the auditor who has acted in afraudulent manner or is abetting or colluding in fraud with themanagement of a company \u2013 If on completion of an enquiry it isfound by the Tribunal that an auditor of a company has, whetherdirectly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted orcolluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the company or its directorsor officers, it may by order direct the company to change its auditors\u2013 Held: s.140(5) is neither discriminatory, arbitrary and/or violativeof Arts. 14, 19(1)(g) of the Constitution \u2013 NCLT exercises quasi-judicial powers u/s.140(5) with all the powers akin to civil court \u2013Ample opportunity is given by NCLT before passing any final order\u2013 Plea that s.140(5) discriminates against the auditors unfairly incomparison to similarly placed alleged perpetrators, such asdirectors, management etc. not tenable, as the role of auditors cannotbe equated with directors and/or management \u2013 Acting in afraudulent manner, directly or indirectly, by an auditor is a veryserious misconduct and therefore the necessary consequence ofindulging into such fraudulent act shall follow \u2013 Merely becausethe auditor can be removed as an auditor of a company under theother provisions, s.140(5) which has been enacted with a specialobject and purpose cannot be said to be arbitrary and/or ultra vires\u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 14 and 19(1)(g).Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.140(5), first proviso \u2013 Powers underthe first proviso to s.140(5) \u2013 Nature of \u2013 Held: It can be said to beinterim or pro tem measure to prevent an existing auditor fromcontinuing and substitute him with an auditor based on a primafacie satisfaction that a fraud has been perpetrated and whencircumstances warrant the substitution \u2013 Such an order can be saidto be an interim order akin to a temporary suspension during thependency of the detailed enquiry as provided in s.140(5) and beforeany final order is passed by the Tribunal.Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.140(5), second proviso \u2013 Objectand purpose of \u2013 When attracted \u2013\u2013 Held: The object and purpose  of second proviso to s.140(5) is to make the provision more stringentand to provide for consequences for an auditor when such an auditoris found to have been perpetrating a fraud and is removed by theNCLT for such fraud \u2013 Before second proviso of s.140(5) is attracted,there must be a detailed enquiry against an auditor of a companyas per first part of s.140(5) and there must be a finding arrived atby the NCLT that the auditor of a company has, directly or indirectly,acted in a fraudulent manner or abetted or colluded in any fraudby, or in relation to, the company or its directors or officers.Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.140(5) \u2013 Powers conferred uponthe Tribunal u/s.140(5) \u2013 If without prejudice to any action underthe provisions of the Act, 2013 or any other law for the time beingin force \u2013 Held: Irrespective of any other provisions of the Act,2013, the Tribunal is vested with powers u/s.140(5) to pass a finalorder against the auditor on the allegation that such an auditor ofthe company has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manner.Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.212(14) \u2013 Quashing and settingaside of s.212(14) direction issued by Union of India to SeriousFraud Investigation Office (SFIO), by the High Court \u2013Consequently prosecution lodged by SFIO set aside \u2013 High Courtset aside the s.212(14) direction mainly on two grounds, firstly, thatthe direction to prosecute was issued within 30 hours of report ofthe SFIO Report which demonstrates non-application of mind andsecondly on ground that SFIO Report was an incomplete report asinvestigation had not been completed and therefore s.212(14)direction was incompetent \u2013 Held: Merely because the direction toprosecute was issued within 30 hours, by that itself, it cannot bepresumed that there was a non-application of mind \u2013 What wasrequired to be considered was, whether there was any material toprosecute or not and whether the direction to prosecute was properlygiven or not \u2013 High Court also did not properly appreciate that theSFIO Report was a report prepared on completion of investigationinto IFIN \u2013 one of the companies under investigation \u2013 IFIN wasone of the subsidiaries in the IL&FS group and the financial servicesarm \u2013 Merely because investigation with respect to other subsidiarycompanies of IL&FS group might have been going on, cannot be aground to observe that so far as IFIN was concerned the reportwas incomplete \u2013 High Court materially erred that investigation in respect of IFIN was incomplete \u2013 Proceedings before the High Courtwere at the stage of direction u/s.212(14) to allow the prosecutionand the sanction to prosecute \u2013 Ample opportunity was available tothe concerned accused \u2013 Therefore, High Court erred in settingaside the direction u/s.212(14).  Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 Chapter X \u2013 Audit and Auditors \u2013Held: Role of auditors cannot be equated with directors and/ormanagement. Words and Phrases \u2013 Word \u201cany\u201d used in second proviso tos.140(5) of the Act, 2013 \u2013 Meaning \u2013 Under second proviso tos.140(5), on the final order being passed by the Tribunal that theauditor/firm has, directly or indirectly, acted in a fraudulent manneror abetted or colluded in any fraud by, or in relation to, the companyor its directors or officers, he/it shall not be eligible to be appointedas an auditor of any company for a period of five years \u2013 Held:The word \u201cany\u201d is significant \u2013 On the final order being passed bythe Tribunal, such an auditor not only shall be removed or changedas an auditor of a company, but such an auditor/firm shall also beineligible to be appointed as an auditor of any other company for aperiod of five years \u2013 Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.140(5).Disposing of the appeals,"
