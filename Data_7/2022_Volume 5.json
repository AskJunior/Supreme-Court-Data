adduced to misplace such presumption \u2013 Thepresumption as contemplated by s.114 is a discretionary presumption.Evidence Act, 1872: Chapter 7 \u2013 Burden of Proof - The phrase\u201cburden of proof\u201d has two meanings one, the burden of proof as amatter of law and pleading and the other, the burden of establishinga case; the former is fixed as a question of law on the basis of thepleadings and is unchanged during the entire trial, whereas thelatter is not constant but shifts as soon as a party adduces sufficientevidence to raise a presumption in his favour.Evidence Act, 1872: Hostile Witness \u2013 Admissibility ofEvidence \u2013 Settled Legal Position \u2013 Even if a witness is treated as\u201chostile\u201d and is cross-examined, his evidence cannot be written offaltogether but must be considered with due care and circumspectionand that part of the testimony which is creditworthy must beconsidered and acted upon."

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: s.302 \u2013 Prosecution case was that onfateful day, appellant-accused murdered his wife and four childrenwith a sharp cutting weapon while they were sleeping \u2013 Motivebehind the murder was attributed to extra marital affair of appellantwith one married lady which was highly opposed by the deceased-wife \u2013 Discovery statement made by appellant and consequentlyrecovery made \u2013 Appellant said to have made extra judicialconfession to prosecution witness \u2013 Trial court convicted theappellant and passed death sentence \u2013 High Court confirmed thedeath sentence \u2013 Hence instant appeal \u2013 Held: Present case is basedon circumstantial evidence \u2013 Mere discovery is insufficient to inferthe authorship of concealment by the person who discovered theweapon \u2013 The exact words of the accused person while makingdiscovery statement was not deposed by prosecution witness \u2013Further, the contents of panchnama were not proved \u2013 Credibilityof police witness (PW-6 and PW-7) was doubtful and evidence ofdiscovery was held to be unreliable \u2013 Credibility of extra judicialconfession was also doubted in view of oral evidence of prosecutionwitness \u2013 As circumstance relating to extra judicial confession anddiscovery of weapon of offence were not established, the chain ofcircumstantial evidence was not established fully and thus othercircumstance such as motive or the evidence of false explanationoffered by the appellant as an additional link in chain of evidencewere not considered \u2013 Further, the explanation offered by theaccused for injuries on his body could be said to be compatiblewith the defense story \u2013 Prosecution failed to establish the casebeyond reasonable doubt and therefore the conviction is set aside.Evidence Act, 1872: s.8 \u2013 Relevance of Motive \u2013 CircumstantialEvidence \u2013 There cannot be straight jacket formula for appreciationof circumstantial evidence \u2013 Circumstances suggesting guilt mustbe cogently and firmly established \u2013 The same must be of definitetendency and conclusive in nature \u2013 The circumstances should formthe chain which conclusively points towards the guilt of accused inall human probability \u2013 Circumstantial evidence must be completeand should be devoid of any hypothesis giving room for accused\u2019sinnocence but must support only one hypothesis i.e. his guilt \u2013 Motive,though not as such an element of crime, but it assumes greaterimportance in cases resting on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Absenceof motive could be a missing link of incriminating circumstances,but once the prosecution has established the other incriminatingcircumstances to its entirety, absence of motive will not give anybenefit to the accused \u2013 Motive could be an important circumstancebut it per se does not take place as conclusive proof that the personconcerned was the author of the crime.Evidence Act, 1872: s.27 \u2013 Discovery Statement \u2013 Informationreceived from the accused must result into discovery of fact for s.27 to apply \u2013 While making such deposition, the accused must be inpolice custody \u2013 Only so much of information as relates distinctlyto the fact thereby discovered is admissible \u2013 Further mere discoverycannot be interpreted as sufficient to infer authorship of concealmentby the person who discovered the weapon \u2013 There might be thepossibility that the person may have seen somebody concealing theweapon, therefore it cannot be presumed or inferred that because aperson discovered weapon, he was the person who concealed it,least it can be presumed that he used it.Evidence Act, 1872: Confession \u2013 Classification and Scope\u2013 Confession can be classified as Judicial and extra-judicial \u2013Former relates to those which are made before the Magistrate orCourt \u2013 Extra Judicial are made before a private individual andwhich may include judicial officer in private capacity andMagistrate not especially empowered u/s 164 CrPC or the one soempowered but receiving confession at stage where s.164 does notapply.Evidence Act, 1872: Extra Judicial Confession \u2013 Weightage\u2013 It is a weak type of evidence since it can be easily procuredwhenever direct evidence is not available \u2013 It is not open to theCourt to start with a presumption that extra-judicial confession isA weak type of evidence \u2013 It can be accepted and can be the basis ofa conviction if it passes the test of credibility \u2013 Credibility can betested by keeping in mind that it comes from an unbiased witnesswho is not inimical to accused and who do not have motive forattributing an untruthful statement to the accused etc.B Evidence Act, 1872: Confession \u2013 Basis of Conviction \u2013Explained \u2013 It is well settled that conviction can be based on avoluntarily confession but the rule of prudence requires thatwherever possible it should be corroborated by the independentevidence \u2013 Further Extra-Judicial confession of accused need notin all cases be corroborated \u2013 Also the confession procured underpromise or threat or harassment is involuntary in nature and cannotbe use in evidence \u2013 Involuntary confession is not which is not theresult of free will of the maker.Evidence Act, 1872: Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013s.313 \u2013 False Explanation tendered by the accused \u2013 Whether formsadditional link in circumstantial evidence \u2013 Explained \u2013 Theprosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot deriveany strength from the weakness of the defence \u2013 It is not the lawwhere there is any infirmity or lacunae in the prosecution case, thesame could be cured or supplied by a false defence or a false pleawhich is not accepted by a Court \u2013 Only when all the circumstantialevidence are well established which points towards the guilt thenonly false explanation or false defence tendered by accused can beused as additional link and not otherwise.Evidence Act, 1872: Burden of Proof \u2013 Extent and Meaning\u2013 In criminal trial the burden on the accused is to show the\u201cpreponderance of probabilty\u201d \u2013 The accused is not under burdento prove his case beyond reasonable doubt unlike prosecution \u2013The meaning which the term \u201cpreponderance of probabilty\u201d carriesis something which connotes to \u201cmore probable and rational viewof the case\u201d, not necessarily as certain as the pleading should be \u2013The high standard of proof as required for prosecution is only toavoid wrongful conviction as the wrongful conviction leads togreater injustice than wrongful acquittal.Constitution of India: Art.39A \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 \u2013 s.304 \u2013 Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 \u2013 s.9 \u2013 Legalaid to accused \u2013 Duty of State \u2013 Explained \u2013 What is meant by theduty of the State to ensure a fair defence to an accused is not theemployment of a defence counsel for namesake \u2013 It has to be theprovision of a counsel who defends the accused diligently to thebest of his abilities \u2013 The presence of counsel on record meanseffective, genuine and faithful presence and not a mere farcical,sham or a virtual presence that is illusory, if not fraudulent \u2013Indigence should never be a ground for denying fair trial or equaljustice therefore, particular attention should be paid to appointcompetent advocates, equal to handling the complex cases, notpatronising gestures to raw entrants to the Bar"

EInsolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s. 2(20) \u2013Operational Creditor \u2013 A person is operational creditor to whomthe operational debt (a debt in respect of dues arising under anylaw for the time being in force and payable to any local authority)is owed and includes any person to whom such debt has been legallyassigned or transferred. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s. 5 (8) \u2013 FinancialDebt \u2013 When an amount could be termed as such \u2013 The policy oflaw under IBC requires \u201cDisbursement\u201d leading to a debt alongwith interest \u2013 Interest, as such, is not a necessary requirement of s.5(8), but the fact of disbursement from the creditor to the debtor isa necessity for looking a debt as financial debt, as contemplated bythe said section \u2013 Such Disbursement has to be understood in termsof money which has been paid by the creditor and debtor.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: ss 5(8), 3(33) \u2013Words \u2018Transaction\u2019 and \u2018Disbursed\u2019 \u2013 Distinguished \u2013 The word\u201ctransaction\u201d includes transfer of assets, funds or goods andservices from or to the corporate debtors \u2013 But imposing such ameaning of the word \u201cTransaction\u201d as inclusive in the word\u201cDisbursed\u201d will lead to unnecessary straining of the provision \u2013Interpretation of the term Disbursed, as occurring u/s.5(8), shouldmean the payment of money, which flows to the debtor.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: ss 3(6), 5(8) \u2013 Words\u2018Claim\u2019 and \u2018Debt\u2019 \u2013 Claim, as defined u/s.3(6), may or may not befixed, disputed or undisputed, secured or unsecured but it bears anindispensable element of \u201cright to payment\u201d \u2013 Claim cannot existsindependent of the element of \u201cright to payment\u201d \u2013 The source ofsuch \u201cright to payment\u201d can be either under a judgment or underany other circumstance \u2013 When claim is accompanied by liability itgives rise to debt \u2013 Debt, as defined under the Code includesfinancial as well as operational debt and the same appears to beintertwined with the definition of \u201cclaim\u201d \u2013 Debt denotes a liabilityor obligation which relates to a claim.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.5(8)(d) \u2013 IndianAccounting Standards \u2013 rr.61 to 67 \u2013 Financial Lease \u2013 Financiallease as such is not defined under IBC \u2013 s.5(8)(d) refers lease asinclusive of Financial lease as given under Indian AccountingStandards \u2013 r.62 declares that a lease is classified as a financiallease if it transfers, substantially, all the risks and rewards incidentalto ownership of an underlying asset \u2013 As per r.63, what matters fora lease to be financial lease is its substance and not the form \u2013 Inthe instant case, the rights are transferred in favour of the alloteesonly by way of a sub-lease, and therefore there is no transfer ofownership of the underlying asset (plot) by the end of the leaseterms \u2013 Further the criteria u/r.63 that the lease will be a financiallease even if the title is not transferred provided the lease term isfor the major part of economic life \u2013 In the instant case the \u201cprincipleof economic life of underlying asset\u201d is inapposite as here theunderlying asset is land and the economic life of the land is notlimited as the land does not depreciate with the passage of time \u2013 Inthe instant case, there is no substantial transfer of risks and rewardsincidental to ownership since the appellant (lessor) has reservedthe right of cancellation of lease in larger public interest andtherefore such appellant is not a financial lessor u/s.5(8)(d) of IBC.Lessee and sub-lease \u2013 Rights and Limitations \u2013 Lessee canassign his rights as a lessee which amounts to assignment of hisrights and, therefore, can create a sub-lease \u2013 But the creation ofsuch sub-lease has limitation and it must conform to the terms ofcontract between the lessor and lessee.Lessee and his right to Mortgage \u2013 Extent and Limitation \u2013 lease may enable the lessee to mortgaged the leased property \u2013 Butin cases where the mortgage by the lessee can be only with theprior permission of lessor, his rights are not absolute and isconditional upon the approval or denial by the lessor of thepermission to make such mortgage.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.5(8)(f) \u2013Interpretation \u2013 \u201cFinancial Debt includes any amount raised underany other transaction, including any forward sale or purchaseagreement, having the commercial effect of a borrowing\u201d \u2013 Scopeof \u2013 The phrase has a relevance as the same is residuary in nature\u2013 For this phrase to apply so as to enable a person for being termedas Financial Creditor, there has to be a raising of funds in atransaction which has a commercial effect \u2013 The first and foremostrule for making such phrase to apply there has to be \u201craising offunds\u201d \u2013 The raising of funds can be by issuing bonds, notes,debentures or loan stock etc \u2013 In the instant case, the raising offunds was done by the lessee from the allottees and not by theappellants and hence the appellant is not entitled to the applicationof the said residuary provision and therefore he cannot avail thebenefit of being called a \u201cFinancial Creditor\u201d"

O. does not run contrary to any ofthe provisions of the Act and the rules framed there under \u2013 Theexecutive was well within its jurisdiction to ensure that the studentscome in the uniform prescribed by the College DevelopmentCommittee \u2013 The object of the G.O. was to ensure that there isparity amongst the students in terms of uniform \u2013 the purpose wasonly to promote uniformity and encourage a secular environmentin the schools, which is in tune with the right guaranteed underArt.14 \u2013 Art.25(2)(a) gives primacy to laws made by competentlegislature for regulation of secular aspects and Art.25(2)(b) givesprimacy to \u201csocial welfare\u201d and \u201creform\u2019\u2019 \u2013 If a particular practice/belief/part of any religion is in existence and is found to be subjectedto either \u201csocial welfare\u201d and \u201creform\u201d, such right will have togive way to \u201csocial welfare\u201d and \u201creform\u201d \u2013 The religious beliefcannot be carried to a secular school maintained out of State funds\u2013 It is open to the students to carry their faith in a school whichpermits them to wear Hijab or any other mark \u2013 The right underArt.19(1)(a) as a right of expression to dress as per one\u2019s own will,however, is also subject to reasonable restrictions under sub-clause(2) of Art.19 \u2013 None of the fundamental rights is absolute, curtailmentof the right is permissible by following due procedure which canwithstand the test of reasonableness \u2013 Students have no right to bein the school in violation of the mandate of the uniform prescribedunder the Statute and the Rules \u2013 If students choose not to attendclasses due to the uniform that has been prescribed, it is a voluntaryact of such students and cannot be said to be in violation of Art.29by the State \u2013 G.O. cannot be said to be against the ethic ofsecularism or to the objective of the Karnataka Education Act, 1983\u2013 Per Sudhanshu Dhulia, J. (Dissenting): The question of ERP was notat all relevant in the determination of the dispute before the Court \u2013Instead of straightaway taking the ERP route, the High Court couldhave first examined whether the restriction imposed by the schoolor the G.O on wearing a Hijab, were valid restrictions or whetherthese restrictions are hit by the Doctrine of Proportionality \u2013 Theentire exercise done by the High Court, in evaluating the rights ofthe petitioners only on the touchstone of ERP, was incorrect \u2013 If thebelief is sincere, and it harms no one else, there can be no justifiablereasons for banning Hijab in a classroom \u2013 Asking a pre universityschoolgirl to take off her Hijab at her school gate, is an invasion onher privacy and dignity \u2013 G.O. and the restrictions on the wearingof hijab, goes against our constitutional value of fraternity andhuman dignity \u2013 Under our Constitutional scheme, wearing a Hijabshould be simply a matter of choice \u2013 It may or may not be a matterof ERP, but it still is, a matter of conscience, belief, and expression\u2013 Asking the girls to take off their Hijab before entering the schoolgates is clearly violative of Arts.19(1)(a), 21 and 25(1) of theConstitution \u2013 There shall be no restriction on the wearing of Hijabanywhere in schools and colleges in Karnataka \u2013 Held: In view ofthe divergent views expressed by the Bench, the matter to be placedbefore the Chief Justice of India for constitution of an appropriateBench \u2013 Karnataka Education Act, 1983 \u2013 ss.133, 145 \u2013 KarnatakaEducational Institutions (Classification, Regulation and Prescriptionof Curricula etc.) Rules, 1995 \u2013 rr.11, 16."
