        "HeadNote": " Bihar Electricity Duty Act, 1948 \u2013 s.9 \u2013 Jharkhand Industrial Policy, 2012 \u2013 The Industrial Policy 2012 was notified by the State government on 16.06.2012 providing an exemption from payment of 50 per cent of the electricity duty for a period of five years \u2013 The policy envisaged that the industrial units will be entitled for reimbursement/payment of subsidy etc. under the different categories only from the next financial year of the date of production \u2013 It was also stipulated in the policy that notifications enforcing the terms of the industrial policy would be issued within a period of one month by the Departments of the State government \u2013 The Departments of the State government failed to comply with the one month time schedule \u2013 Eventually, the State government issued an exemption notification on 08.01.2015 but made it effective from the date on which it was issued \u2013 Writ petition by the respondent \u2013 Before the High Court, the respondent claimed that the clause in the notification making it prospective should be effaced since it was contrary to the representation that was held out by the Industrial Policy 2012 \u2013 Alternately, the respondent sought a direction that it would be entitled to an exemption from electricity duty for a period of five years from the date of the issuance of the notification \u2013 High Court held that there was no specific reason for delay and that \u2018but for the lethargic approach of the state authorities\u2019 the exemption should have been issued within a month of the issuance of the Industrial Policy 2012 \u2013 The High Court concluded that the notification dated 08.01.2015 issued by the Commercial Tax Department of the State government ought not to be construed with prospective effect and the clause making it prospective would have to be struck down \u2013 The notification was deemed to be in effect from the date of the Industrial Policy 2012 (1 April 2011) \u2013 The electricity duty deposited for FYs 2011-12, 2012-13 and 2013-14 was directed to be adjusted against the future liability of the respondent towards electricity duty \u2013 On appeal, held: The State government issued a statutory notification u/s. 9, but by doing so prospectively with effect from 08.01.2015 it negated the nature of the representation which was held out in the Industrial Policy 2012 \u2013 Absolutely no justification bearing on reasons of policy or public interest has been offered before the High Court or before the Supreme Court for the delay in issuing a notification \u2013 Since the State has offered no justification for the delay in issuance of the notification, or provided reasons for it being in public interest, such a course of action by the State is arbitrary and is violative of Art.14 \u2013 In the instant case, the respondent is entitled to a rebate/deduction from electricity duty \u2013 However, the respondent would not be entitled to a rebate/deduction for FY 2011- 12 \u2013 In terms of the Industrial Policy 2012, the entitlement ensues from the financial year following the commencement of production \u2013 The respondent commenced production on 17.08.2011 \u2013 Therefore, the order of the High Court for the FYs 2012-13 and 2013-14 is confirmed. Principles/Doctrines \u2013 Promissory estoppel \u2013 Origins and evolution \u2013 discussed. Principles/Doctrines \u2013 Promissory estoppel and legitimate expectation \u2013 Difference between \u2013 discussed. "

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.156(1) and s.179 \u2013 Conjoint reading of \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss. 295A, 153A, 505(2) \u2013 Hate speech \u2013 Cause of Action \u2013 While hosting a debate show, the petitioner had described Pir Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti, as an invader, terrorist and robber who had come to India to convert its population to Islam \u2013 Post the telecast as many as seven FIRs concerning the said episode were filed and registered against the petitioner in the States of Rajasthan, Telangana, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh \u2013 Petitioner contended that criminal proceedings arising from the impugned FIRs ought to be quashed as these FIRs were registered in places where no \u2018cause of action\u2019 arose \u2013 Held: s.179 of Cr.P.C. provides that an offence is triable at the place where an act is done or its consequence ensues \u2013 The audience, including the complainants, were located in different parts of India and were affected by the utterances of the petitioner \u2013 Further, clause (1) of s.156 of Cr.P.C. provides that any officer in-charge of a police station may investigate any cognizable case which a court having jurisdiction over the local limits of such station would have the power to inquire into or try \u2013 Thus, a conjoint reading of ss.179 and 156 (1) of the Cr.P.C. make it clear that the impugned FIRs do not suffer from this jurisdictional defect. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s. 95 \u2013 Act causing slight harm \u2013 While hosting a debate show, the petitioner had described Pir Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti, as an invader, terrorist and robber who had come to India to convert its population to Islam \u2013 The petitioner has relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Veeda Menez and the decision of the High Court of Delhi in Neelam Mahajan to plead the defence of trifle u/s. 95 of the Penal Code \u2013 Held: The instant case cannot be equated with either Veeda Menez or Neelam Mahajan\u2019s case where the factual matrix was undisputed and admitted \u2013 It would be wrong and inappropriate in the present context to prejudge and pronounce on aspects which are factual and disputed \u2013 The plea raised by the petitioner cannot be accepted without ascertaining facts and evidence Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 19(1)(a), 19(2) and 32 \u2013 Hate Speech \u2013 Constitutional and statutory treatment of \u2018hate speech\u2019 depends on the values sought to be promoted, perceived harm involved and the importance of these harms \u2013 Consequently, a universal definition of \u2018hate speech\u2019 remains difficult, except for one commonality that \u2018incitement to violence\u2019 is punishable. International Law \u2013 Hate Speech \u2013 The American Framework on hate speech is based on four major philosophical justifications; Justification from democracy, Social contract theory, Pursuit of the truth and Idea of autonomy \u2013 The Canadian approach emphasises on multiculturalism and group equality, as it places greater emphasis on cultural diversity and promotes the idea of ethnic mosaic \u2013 The Australian approach is substantially aligned with Canada \u2013 The South African position regards dignity as paramount constitutional value and the law and the courts are willing to subjugate freedom of expression when the latter sufficiently undermines the former \u2013 The position in the United Kingdom has shifted over the years from reinforcing the security of the government to checking incitement to racial hatred among non-target audience with the aim of protecting targets against racially motivated harassment \u2013 Germany believes that freedom of expression is one amongst several rights which is limited by principles of equality, dignity and multiculturalism \u2013 The French law gives primacy to freedom of expression, which it believes is meaningless without the right to offend, which would to some not only include the right to criticise and provoke but also the right to ridicule when it comes to ideas and beliefs, including religious beliefs. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.295A \u2013 Held: Import of s.295A of the Penal Code, Ramji Lal Modi holds, is to curb speech made with \u2018malicious intent\u2019 and not \u2018offensive speech\u2019 \u2013 Criminality would not include insults to religion offered unwittingly, carelessly or without deliberate or malicious intent to outrage the religious feelings \u2013 Only aggravated form of insult to religion when it is perpetuated with deliberate and malicious intent to outrage the religious feelings of that group is punishable. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 19 \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.153A and s.505(2) \u2013 In Ramji Lal Modi and the later decision in Bilal Ahmed Kaloo, which had examined ss.153A and 505(2) of the Penal Code, had primarily applied the \u2018Bad Tendency test\u2019 as propounded by the American jurists \u2013 In Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia, referring to the words \u2018in the interest of\u2026 public order\u2019 in clause (2) to Article 19 had observed that order is a basic need in any organised society \u2013 It implies orderly state of society or community in which the citizens can peacefully pursue their normal activities of life . Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018minor breaches\u2019 and \u2018security of State\u2019 \u2013 discuss and defined. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 19 \u2013 \u2018Dignity\u2019 in the context of hate speech \u2013 Held: Loss of dignity and selfworth of the targeted group members contributes to disharmony amongst groups, erodes tolerance and open-mindedness which are a must for multi-cultural society committed to the idea of equality \u2013 It affects an individual as a member of a group \u2013 It is however necessary that at least two groups or communities must be involved; merely referring to feelings of one community or group without any reference to any other community or group does not attract the \u2018hate speech\u2019 definition. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 19 \u2013 Hate speech \u2013 Dignity of individual and unity and integrity of the nation \u2013 Held: Dignity of individual and unity and integrity of the nation are linked, one in the form of rights of individuals and other in the form of individual\u2019s obligation to others to ensure unity and integrity of the nation \u2013 The unity and integrity of the nation cannot be overlooked and slighted, as the acts that \u2018promote\u2019 or are \u2018likely\u2019 to \u2018promote\u2019 divisiveness, alienation and schematism do directly and indirectly impinge on the diversity and pluralism, and when they are with the objective and intent to cause public disorder or to demean dignity of the targeted groups, they have to be dealt with as per law \u2013 The purpose is not to curtail right to expression and speech, albeit not gloss over specific egregious threats to public disorder and in particular the unity and integrity of the nation. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 19 \u2013 Hate speech \u2013 Analysis and definition of \u2013 Held: Three distinct elements that legislatures and courts can use to define and identify \u2018hate speech\u2019, namely \u2013 contentbased element, intent-based element and harm-based element (or impact-based element) \u2013 The content-based element involves open use of words and phrases generally considered to be offensive to a particular community and objectively offensive to the society \u2013 The intent-based element of \u2018hate speech\u2019 requires the speaker\u2019s message to intend only to promote hatred, violence or resentment against a particular class or group without communicating any legitimate message \u2013 The harm or impact-based element refers to the consequences of the \u2018hate speech\u2019 that is to harm victim which can be violent or such as loss of self-esteem, economic or social subordination. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 19 \u2013 Distinction between Free speech and Hate speech \u2013 Held: A distinction between \u2018free speech\u2019 which includes the right to comment, favour or criticise government policies; and \u2018hate speech\u2019 creating or spreading hatred against a targeted community or group \u2013 The former is primarily concerned with political, social and economic issues and policy matters, the latter would not primarily focus on the subject matter but on the substance of the message which is to cause humiliation and alienation of the targeted group \u2013 The object of criminalising the latter type of speech is to protect the dignity and to ensure political and social equality between different identities and groups regardless of caste, creed, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, linguistic preference etc.\u2013 Freedom to express and speak is the most important condition for political democracy. Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018Tolerance\u2019 \u2013 discuss and defined. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.153A \u2013 Held: Deliberate and malicious intent is necessary and can be gathered from the words itselfsatisfying the test of top of Clapham omnibus, the who factor person making the comment, the targeted and non targeted group, the context and occasion factor- the time and circumstances in which the words or speech was made, the state of feeling between the two communities, etc. and the proximate nexus with the protected harm to cumulatively satiate the test of \u2018hate speech\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Good faith\u2019 and \u2018no legitimate purpose\u2019 test would apply, as they are important in considering the intent factor. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.153A (b) \u2013 Held: In the context of s.153A(b), public tranquillity, given the nature of the consequence in the form of punishment of imprisonment of up to three years, must be read in a restricted sense synonymous with public order and safety and not normal law and order issues that do not endanger the public \u2013 It cannot be given the widest meaning so as to fall foul of the requirement of reasonableness which is a constitutional mandate  Words and Phrases \u2013 \u201cAttempt\u2019 in the context of hate speech \u2013 Held: An \u2018attempt to constitute a crime\u2019, the impugned act should be more than mere preparation and reasonably proximate to the consummation of the offence, which has been interrupted \u2013 In the context of \u2018hate speech\u2019, including the offences related to promoting disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will, and insulting the religion or the religious beliefs, it would certainly require the actual utterance of words or something more than thought which would constitute the content. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Quashing of FIR at an early stage \u2013 The Supreme Court has at the initial stage quashed the proceedings arising out of the FIR, namely, Manzar Sayeed Khan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ramesh as well as Balwant Singh \u2013 However, the ratio in Balwant Singh has to be applied with caution as the decision had proceeded on failure of prosecution. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 First Information Report (FIR) \u2013 Definition and meaning of \u2013 Held: Acronym FIR, or the First Information Report, is neither defined in the Criminal Code nor is used therein, albeit it refers to the information relating to the commission of a cognisable offence \u2013 This information, if given orally to an officer in-charge of the police station, is mandated to be reduced in writing \u2013 Information to be recorded in writing need not be necessarily by an eye-witness, and hence, cannot be rejected merely because it is hearsay \u2013 S.154 does not mandate nor is this requirement manifest from other provisions of the Criminal Code \u2013 Lalita Kumari held that s.154 of the Criminal Code, in unequivocal terms, mandates registration of FIR on receipt of all cognisable offences, subject to exceptions in which case a preliminary inquiry is required \u2013 Tapan Kumar Singh held that the FIR is not an encyclopaedia disclosing all facts and details relating to the offence. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 FIR \u2013 Quashing of \u2013 FIRs registered against the petitioner for describing Pir Hazrat Moinuddin Chishti, as an invader, terrorist and robber who had come to India to convert its population to Islam \u2013 Petitioner sought quashing of FIRs \u2013 Held: The petitioner was an equal co-participant, rather than a mere host \u2013 Three distinct elements that used to define and identify \u2018hate speech\u2019, namely-content-based element, intentbased element and harm-based element (or impact-based element), need to be evaluated before the Court \u2013 These have to be evaluated, before the Court form an opinion on whether an offence is made out \u2013 Thus, it would not be appropriate at this stage to quash FIRs and stall the investigation into all the relevant aspects. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Multiple FIRs \u2013 In Babubhai v. State of Gujarat and others wherein the test to determine sameness of the FIRs has been elucidated as when the subject matter of the FIRs is the same incident, same occurrence or are in regard to incidents which are two or more parts of the same transaction \u2013 If the answer to the question is affirmative, then the second FIR need not be proceeded with. Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018ordre publique\u2019, \u2018public tranquillity\u2019 and \u2018public order\u2019 \u2013 discussed. "

Evidence Act, 1872: s.92, proviso (6) and illustration (f); s.94 and s.95 \u2013 Interpretation of documents exchanged between the parties in the performance of a contract \u2013 Reading together proviso (6) and illustration (f) to s.92, s.94 and s.95 of the Evidence Act show that when there are a number of documents exchanged between the parties in the performance of a contract, all of them must be read as a connected whole, relating each particular document to \u201cexistifacts\u201d, which include how particular words are used in a particular sense, given the entirety of correspondence between the parties \u2013 Thus, after the application of proviso (6) to s.92 of the Evidence Act, the adjudicating authority must be very careful when it applies provisions dealing with patent ambiguity, as it must first ascertain whether the plain language of a particular document applies accurately to existing facts \u2013 If, however, it is ambiguous or unmeaning in reference to existing facts, evidence may then be given to show that the words used in a particular document were used in a sense that would make the said words meaningful in the context of the entirety of the correspondence between the parties \u2013 In the instant case, the three critical emails have to be read in the surrounding circumstances of the entirety of the LTA and the correspondence which ensued between the parties \u2013 Once that exercise is undertaken, as was undertaken by the Majority Award, it was not possible to hold that the Majority Award was not a possible view on the facts of this case \u2013 The reliance of the Majority Award upon the correspondence between the parties buttressed by evidence on behalf of appellant, was not therefore flawed Evidence Act, 1872: ss.92, 94, 95 \u2013 A \u201cpatent ambiguity\u201d provision, as contained in s.94 of the Evidence Act, is only applicable when a document applies accurately to existing facts, which includes how a particular word is used in a particular sense \u2013 Given that, in the facts of the present case, there was no mention of the price at which coal was to be supplied in the three \u201ccrucial\u201d emails, these emails must be read as part of the entirety of the correspondence between the parties, which would then make the so-called \u201cadmissions\u201d in the emails apply to existing facts \u2013 Once this is done, it is clear that there is no scope for the further application of the \u201cpatent ambiguity\u201d principle contained in s.94 of the Evidence Act, to the facts of the present case \u2013 However, s.95 of the Evidence Act, dealing with latent ambiguity, when read with proviso (6) and illustration (f) to s.92 of the Evidence Act, could apply to the facts of the present case, as when the plain language of a document is otherwise unmeaning in reference to how particular words are used in a particular sense, given the entirety of the correspondence, evidence may be led to show the peculiar sense of such language \u2013 Thus, if this provision is applied, the Majority Award cannot be faulted as it has accepted the evidence given by Mr. Wilcox, wherein he explained that the three emails would only be meaningful if they were taken to refer to \u201cmixed\u201d supplies of coal, and not supplies of coal at the contractual price. Law of evidence \u2013 Latent ambiguity and patent ambiguity \u2013 Distinction between.   "
