Consequently, the appellant was liable to pay, in terms of s.26(6A), 10 per cent of the tax disputed together with the filing of the appeal \u2013 There is no reason why the amount which was paid under protest, should not be taken into consideration \u2013 Rejection of the appeal was not in order and the appeal would have to be restored to the file of the appellate authority, subject to due verification that 10 per cent of the amount of tax disputed has been duly deposited by the appellant \u2013 Interpretation of statutes. Interpretation of statutes: A taxing statute must be construed strictly and literally \u2013 There is no room for intendment \u2013 Maharashtra Value Added Tax Act, 2002 \u2013 s.26(6A)."

Writ petition by State was dismissed \u2013 Hence instant appeal \u2013 Held: Admittedly, the appointment on compassionate grounds in the State of Karnataka is governed by a set of Rules known as Karnataka Civil Services (Appointment on Compassionate grounds) Rules, 1996, issued in exercise of the powers conferred by s.3(1) read with s.8 of the Karnataka State Civil Services Act, 1978 \u2013 The Rules as they stood, on the date on which the sister of the respondent died in harness, did not include an unmarried brother, within the definition of the expression \u201cdependent of a deceased Government servant\u201d under r.2(1)(a) of the said Rules vis-a-vis a deceased female unmarried Government servant \u2013 But it was only by way of an amendment proposed under a draft Notification dated 20.06.2012 which was given effect on 11.07.2012 that an unmarried brother of a deceased female unmarried Government servant was included within the definition \u2013 There is no dispute about the fact that the sister of the respondent died as an unmarried female Government servant, but on 8.12.2010, before the amendment was made to the Rules \u2013 Respondent\u2019s application dismissed. Interpretation of statutes: There is no principle of statutory interpretation which permits a decision on the applicability of a rule, to be based upon an indeterminate or variable factor \u2013 A rule of interpretation which produces different results, depending upon what the individuals do or do not do, is inconceivable."

Ramasubramanian, J.: This is a case where the petitioner, after making a clear offer to furnish a bank guarantee of a scheduled Indian bank, has chosen to take advantage of a mistake that crept in the order passes by Single Bench which was rectified later on \u2013The order dated 09.04.2019 was to correct a mistake that had inadvertently crept in \u2013 The question whether there exists statutorily, a distinction between \u201ca Scheduled Indian Bank\u201d and \u201ca Scheduled Bank located in India\u201d does not arise for consideration in this case, as the dispute primarily revolves around what was offered in Court by one of the parties, what was accepted in Court, and what was recorded in the Order and clarified later \u2013 Therefore, the Special Leave Petitions are dismissed \u2013 No interference u/Art.136 of the Constitution required \u2013 Since, both the Judges have not been able to agree, the matter to be placed before the Chief Justice of India for appropriate directions."

January, 2008 \u2013 Therefore, the arbitrator ought not to have awarded any amount beyond the above time periodbeyond January, 2008 \u2013 To that extent the award passed by the arbitrator can be said to be perverse and to that extent the present appeals are required to be allowed."

Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \u2013 ss. 2(r), 2(s), 2(y), 3 and 56 \u2013 Benchmark disability not a precondition to obtain a scribe \u2013 Held: The whole concept of a benchmark disability within the meaning of s. 2(r) is primarily in the context of special provisions including reservation that are embodied in Chapter VI of the RPwD Act 2016 \u2013 Conceivably, the Parliament while mandating the reservation of posts in government establishments and of seats in institutions of higher learning was of the view that this entitlement should be recognized for persons with benchmark disabilities \u2013 As a matter of legislative policy, these provisions in Chapter VI have been made applicable to those with benchmark disabilities where a higher threshold of disability is stipulated \u2013 Conflating the rights and entitlements which inhere in persons with disabilities with the notion of benchmark disabilities does dis-service to the salutary purpose underlying the enactment of the RPwD Act 2016 \u2013 To deny the rights and entitlements recognized for persons with disabilities on the ground that they do not fulfill a benchmark disability would be plainly ultra vires the RPwD Act 2016. Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 19 and 21 \u2013 Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \u2013 Held: The golden triangle of Arts. 14, 19 and 21 applies with full force and vigour to the disabled \u2013 S.3 is a statutory recognition of the constitutional rights embodied in Arts. 14, 19 and 21 among other provisions of Part III of the Constitution \u2013 S. 3 casts an affirmative obligation on the government to ensure that persons with disabilities enjoy (i) the right to equality; (ii) a life with dignity; and (iii) respect for their integrity equally with others. Principles/Doctrines \u2013 Principle of reasonable accomodation \u2013 Rights of Persons with Disabilities \u2013 Held: The principle of reasonable accommodation captures the positive obligation of the State and private parties to provide additional support to persons with disabilities to facilitate their full and effective participation in society \u2013 The concept of reasonable accommodation in s. 2(y) of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 incorporates making \u201cnecessary and appropriate modification and adjustments\u201d so long as they do not impose a disproportionate or undue burden in a particular case to ensure to persons with disability the enjoyment or exercise of rights equally with others\u201d \u2013 Equality, non- discrimination and dignity are the essence of the protective ambit of the RPwD Act 2016. Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \u2013 Formulation of new policy concerning access to scribes for persons with disabilities \u2013 Held: Direction issued to the Union Government in the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to ensure the framing of proper guidelines which would regulate and facilitate the grant of a facility of a scribe to persons with disability within the meaning of s. 2(s) where the nature of the disability operates to impose a barrier to the candidate writing an examination \u2013 It was also directed to consult persons with disabilities and involve them in the decision making process."

Customs Act, 1962 \u2013 s.125 \u2013 Import \u2013 \u2018prohibited goods\u2019 and \u2018other goods\u2019 \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Latter part of s.125 obligates the release of confiscated goods (i.e., other than prohibited goods) against redemption fine but, the earlier part of this provision makes no such compulsion as regards the prohibited goods; and it is left to the discretion of the Adjudicating Authority that it may give an option for payment of fine in lieu of confiscation \u2013 If the Adjudicating Authority does not choose to give such an option, the result would be of absolute confiscation \u2013 Principles to be applied for exercise of discretion so available in the first part of s.125(1) \u2013 Held: Exercise of discretion is a critical and solemn exercise, to be undertaken rationally and cautiously and guided by law; according to rules of reason and justice; and based on relevant considerations \u2013 The purpose behind leaving such discretion with the Adjudicating Authority in relation to prohibited goods is to ensure that all the pros and cons shall be weighed before taking a final decision for release or absolute confiscation of goods \u2013 On facts, orders-in- original dated 28.08.2020 of the Adjudicating Authority cannot be said to have been passed in a proper exercise of discretion \u2013 The Adjudicating Authority did not even pause to consider if the other alternative of absolute confiscation was available to it in its discretion as per the first part of s.125(1) of the Customs Act and proceeded as if it has to give the option of payment of fine in lieu of confiscation \u2013 Such exercise of discretion by the Adjudicating Authority was more of assumptive and ritualistic nature rather than of a conscious and cautious adherence to the applicable principles \u2013 When personal business interests of importers clash with public interest, the former has to, obviously, give way to the latter \u2013 Further, if excessive improperly imported goods are allowed to enter the country\u2019s market, the entire purpose of the notifications would be defeated \u2013 Discretion in cases of present nature, involving far-reaching impact on national economy, cannot be exercised only with reference to the hardship suggested by the importers, who made such improper imports only for personal gains \u2013 The imports in question suffer from the vices of breach of law as also lack of bona fide and accordingly held liable to absolute confiscation but with a relaxation of allowing re- export, on payment of necessary redemption fine and subject to the importer discharging other statutory obligations \u2013 No leniency in the name of equity can be claimed by the importers \u2013 Respondent- importers being responsible for improper imports as also for the present litigation, apart from other consequences, also deserve to be saddled with heavier costs \u2013 Respondent-importers to pay costs of litigation to appellants, quantified at Rs. 2,00,000/- each. Import-Export \u2013 Adjudicating Authority, while ordering confiscation, gave option to the importers to redeem the goods in question on payment of fine in lieu of confiscation u/s.125(1) of the Customs Act \u2013 However, the DGFT took exception against release of the goods stating that the same were restricted items \u2013 Importers (private respondents) approached the High Court by way of separate writ petitions, seeking mandamus for clearance of the goods in question \u2013 While the writ petitions were pending, the Commissioner of Customs passed order dated 01.10.2020 in exercise of his powers u/s.129D(2) of the Customs Act, pointing out the alleged deficiencies in the adjudication orders; and directed filing of appeals before the Commissioner (Appeals) \u2013 Meanwhile, the High Court by order dated 15.10.2020 held that, prima facie, the grounds stated in the order dated 01.10.2020 did not make out any such case of illegality or impropriety as to call for exercise of suo motu revisional powers by the Commissioner under s.129D(2) of the Customs Act \u2013 Having said that, the High Court left the matter to be decided by the Commissioner (Appeals) \u2013 However, thereafter, the High Court issued directions to the respondents to forthwith release the goods of the importers \u2013 Legality and validity of the orders passed by the High Court \u2013 Held: Order dated 15.10.2020 passed by High Court suffers from inherent contradictions and inconsistencies; and cannot be approved \u2013 Significantly, if the purport of the order dated 15.10.2020 of the High Court had been that even if Commissioner (Appeals) would be deciding the matter in appeal, he could not order absolute confiscation of the goods because the High Court had ordered their release, it would immediately lead to the position that the order dated 15.10.2020 of the High Court carried inherent contradictions \u2013 If release of goods was the only option available with the authorities, the material part of consideration of the Appellate Authority had already been rendered redundant \u2013 When the matter was left for decision by the Commissioner (Appeals), there was neither any occasion nor any justification for the High Court to pass the order for release of the goods for the simple reason that any order for release of goods was to render the material part of the matter a fait accompli \u2013 This, simply, could not have been done \u2013Apart from the fundamental flaws of contradictions, the order passed by the High Court on 15.10.2020 further suffers from the shortcomings that while issuing mandamus for release of goods, the High Court omitted to take into account the relevant facts as also the material factors concerning the imports in question \u2013 Impugned order dated 15.10.2020, having been passed while ignoring the relevant considerations, cannot be approved. Equity \u2013 Claim of \u2013 Held: Once the Court has reached to the conclusion that a particular action is wanting in bona fide, the perpetrator cannot claim any relief in equity in relation to the same action \u2013 Absence of bona fide in a claimant and his claim of equity remain incompatible and cannot stand together. Interim relief \u2013 Grant of \u2013 Matter of discretion \u2013 Considerations \u2013 Held: In matters of grant of interim relief, satisfaction of the Court only about existence of prima facie case in favour of the suitor is not enough \u2013 The other elements i.e., balance of convenience and likelihood of irreparable injury, carry their own relevance; and while exercising its discretion in the matter of interim relief and adopting a particular course, the Court needs to weigh the risk of injustice, if ultimately the decision of main matter runs counter to the course being adopted at the time of granting or refusing the interim relief."

Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 Claim of juvenility \u2013 Held: A claim of juvenility may be raised at any stage of a criminal proceeding, even after final disposal of the case \u2013 A delay in raising the claim of juvenility cannot be a ground for rejection of such claim \u2013 It can also be raised for the first time before Supreme Court \u2013 A hyper-technical approach should not be adopted when evidence is adduced on behalf of the accused in support of the plea that he was a juvenile \u2013 If two views are possible on the same evidence, the court should lean in favour of holding the accused to be a juvenile in borderline cases. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 ss.9, 94 \u2013 Determination of juvenility \u2013 Held: When the issue of juvenility arises before a Court, it would be u/sub-section (2) and (3) of s.9 but when a person is brought before a Committee or JJ Board, s.94 applies \u2013 Further, if the JJ Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Board shall undertake the process of age determination by seeking evidence \u2013 Age recorded by the JJ Board to be the age of the person so brought before it shall, for the purpose of the 2015 Act, be deemed to be true age of that person \u2013 Hence, the degree of proof required in such a proceeding before the JJ Board, when an application is filed seeking a claim of juvenility when the trial is before the concerned criminal court, is higher than when an inquiry is made by a court before which the case regarding the commission of the offence is pending. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 s.94 \u2013 Presumption of juvenility \u2013 Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007 \u2013 r.12 \u2013 Held: When a claim for juvenility is raised, the burden is on the person raising the claim to satisfy the Court to discharge the initial burden \u2013 However, the documents mentioned in r.12(3)(a)(i), (ii), and (iii), 2007 Rules or sub-section (2) of s.94, shall be sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the Court \u2013 On the basis of the aforesaid documents a presumption of juvenility may be raised \u2013 However, said presumption is not conclusive proof of the age of juvenility and may be rebutted by contra evidence. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 Absence of documents mentioned in s.94(2), determination of age \u2013 Held: Ossification Test cannot be the sole criterion for age determination \u2013 A mechanical view regarding the age of a person cannot be adopted solely on the basis of medical opinion by radiological examination \u2013 Such evidence is not conclusive evidence but only a very useful guiding factor to be considered in the absence of documents mentioned in s.94(2)."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Resolution plan \u2013 Activities of the corporate debtor had impact on a large number of persons/ entities, including buyers of flats/apartments in its real estate development projects \u2013 Whether, after approval of the resolution plan of NBCC by the Committee of Creditors, where homebuyers as a class assented to the plan, any individual homebuyer or any association of homebuyers could maintain a challenge to the resolution plan and could be treated as a dissenting financial creditor or an aggrieved person \u2013 Whether any housing project which was completed or nearing completion ought to be kept out of the purview of the resolution plan \u2013 Held: On facts, the homebuyers as a class having assented to the resolution plan of NBCC, any individual homebuyer or any association of homebuyers cannot maintain a challenge to the resolution plan and cannot be treated as a dissenting financial creditor or an aggrieved person; and when the resolution plan comprehensively deals with all the assets and liabilities of the corporate debtor, no housing project of the corporate debtor could be segregated merely for the reason that same was completed or nearing completion."

        ],
        "HeadNote": "Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 ss. 241 and 242 \u2013 Held: The sine qua non for invoking s.241 is that the affairs of the Company should have been conducted or are being conducted in a manner oppressive or prejudicial to some of the members \u2013 In a petition u/ s.241, the Tribunal cannot ask the question whether the removal of a Director was legally valid and/or justified or not \u2013 The question to be asked is whether such a removal tantamount to a conduct oppressive or prejudicial to some members \u2013 Even in cases where the Tribunal finds that the removal of a Director was not in accordance with law or was not justified on facts, the Tribunal cannot grant a relief u/s.242 unless the removal was oppressive or prejudicial \u2013 There may be cases where the removal of a Director might have been carried out perfectly in accordance with law and yet may be part of a larger design to oppress or prejudice the interests of some members \u2013 It is only in such cases that the Tribunal can grant a relief u/s.242 \u2013 The validity and justification for the removal of a person can never be the primary focus of a Tribunal u/s.242 unless the same is in furtherance of a conduct oppressive or prejudicial to some of the members \u2013 On facts, the removal of a person from the post of Executive Chairman cannot be termed as oppressive or prejudicial \u2013The original cause of action for the complainant companies to approach NCLT was the removal of CPM from the post of Executive Chairman \u2013 Though the complainant companies padded up their actual grievance with various historical facts to make a deceptive appearance, the causa proxima for the complaint was the removal of CPM from the office of Executive Chairman \u2013 His removal from Directorship happened subsequent to the filing of the original complaint and that too for valid and justifiable reasons and hence NCLAT could not have laboured so much on the removal of CPM, for granting relief u/ss.241 and 242. Company Law \u2013 Held: Company Tribunal is not a labour Court or an administrative Tribunal to focus entirely on the manner of removal of a person from Directorship. Company Law \u2013 Winding up order on just and equitable grounds \u2013 Held: There must lie a justifiable lack of confidence in the conduct and management of the company\u2019s affairs, at the foundation of applications for winding up \u2013 The case on hand does not fall anywhere near the just and equitable standard, for the simple reason that it was the very same complaining minority whose representative was not merely given a berth on the Board but was also projected as the successor to the Office of Chairman \u2013 For invocation of just and equitable clause, there must be a justifiable lack of confidence on the conduct of the directors \u2013 A mere lack of confidence between the majority shareholders and minority shareholders would not be sufficient \u2013 On facts, Tata Sons is a principal investment holding Company, of which the majority shareholding is with philanthropic Trusts \u2013 The majority shareholders are not individuals or corporate entities having deep pockets into which the dividends find their way if the Company does well and declares dividends \u2013 The dividends that the Trusts get are to find their way eventually to the fulfilment of charitable purposes \u2013 Therefore, NCLAT should have raised the most fundamental question whether it would be equitable to wind up the Company and thereby starve to death those charitable Trusts, especially on the basis of un-charitable allegations of oppressive and prejudicial conduct \u2013 Finding of NCLAT that the facts otherwise justify the winding up of the Company under the just and equitable clause, was completely flawed. Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 ss. 241 and 242 \u2013 ss.241 and 242 do not specifically confer the power of reinstatement, nor there is any scope for holding that such a power to reinstate can be implied or inferred from any of the powers specifically conferred \u2013 The architecture of ss.241 and 242 does not permit the Tribunal to read into the Sections, a power to make an order (for reinstatement) which is barred by law vide s.14 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 with or without the amendment in 2018.Company Law \u2013 Law relating to oppression and mismanagement \u2013 Held: Despite the law relating to oppression and mismanagement undergoing several changes, the object that a Tribunal should keep in mind while passing an order in an application complaining of oppression and mismanagement, has remained the same for decades \u2013 This object is that the Tribunal, by its order, should bring to an end the matters complained of \u2013 The purpose of an order both under the English Law and under the Indian Law, irrespective of whether the regime is one of \u201coppressive conduct\u201d or \u201cunfairly prejudicial conduct\u201d or a mere \u201cprejudicial conduct\u201d, is to bring to an end the matters complained of by providing a solution \u2013 The object cannot be to provide a remedy worse than the disease \u2013 The object should be to put an end to the matters complained of and not to put an end to the company itself, forsaking the interests of other stakeholders. Company Law \u2013 Articles of Association of a company \u2013 Held: That Articles of Association of a company constitute a contract among shareholders, is the bedrock of Company Law \u2013 A person who willingly became a shareholder and thereby subscribed to the Articles of Association and who was a willing and consenting party to the amendments carried out to those Articles, cannot later on turn around and challenge those Articles \u2013 The same would tantamount to requesting the Court to rewrite a contract to which he became a party with eyes wide open. Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.241 \u2013 s.241 is not intended to discipline a Management in respect of a possible future conduct. Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.242 \u2013 Articles of Association of a company \u2013 Held: The Tribunal has the power u/s.242 to set aside any amendment to the Articles that takes away recognised proprietary rights of shareholders \u2013 But this is on the premise that the bringing up of amendment itself was a conduct that was oppressive or prejudicial \u2013 On facts, the order of NCLAT tinkering with the power available under Article 75 of the Articles of Association was wholly unsustainable."
