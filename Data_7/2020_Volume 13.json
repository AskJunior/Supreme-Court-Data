rigorous imprisonment forlife under two counts, i.e. s.376(1)(2)(f), (i) and (m) of IPC and u/s.6 of POCSO Act \u2013 The High Court affirmed the conviction andthe sentence passed by the Trial Court \u2013 On appeal, held: Accordingto the prosecution, on the day in question at about 7:30 p.m. whenthe victim was with her grandfather, on the pretext that the father ofthe victim had asked the appellant to bring the victim, the appellant,who was maternal uncle of the victim, took her away, this part isconclusively established through the testimony of PW-2, thegrandfather \u2013 As deposed by PWs 1 and 2, the appellant was foundby the side of the victim at the spot \u2013 The victim was having variousinjuries whereafter she was taken for medical attention \u2013 Soon afterincident appellant was also medically examined and injuries werefound on his private parts \u2013 The proximity in terms of time and thepromptitude in reporting are crucial factors and the evidence inthat behalf is completely trustworthy \u2013 The approximate time of theinjury of the appellant as given in report is consistent with the caseof prosecution \u2013 The pant of the victim was found at the spot ofincident is well established \u2013 In terms of chemical analyser\u2019s report,the blood found on the trousers of the appellant was that of victim\u2013 This fact is also completely established \u2013 And it is a matter ofrecord that as per post-mortem report and medical opinion, therewas forceful sexual assault on the victim and her death was causeddue to injury which was in nature of multiple lacerations over vaginaland anal region; and merging of vaginal and anal orifices \u2013 Allthese circumstances stand proved beyond any doubt and bythemselves constitute a conclusive and consistent chain excludingevery other hypothesis except the guilt of the appellant \u2013 Theappellant is thus guilty of having committed offences punishableunder clauses (f), (i) and (m) of sub-section (2) of s.376 of IPC;and also, under clauses (j) and (m) of s.5 r/w s.6 of the POCSO Act,(as it stood before it was amended by Act 25 of 2019) \u2013 Sinceaccording to medical opinion, the death was because of sexualassault, the appellant is also guilty of having committed offencepunishable u/s. 376A of IPC.Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss.299, 300 and s.302 \u2013 Rape andmurder of a minor child \u2013 A two-and-a-half-year-old girl wassubjected to sexual assault \u2013 Her death was caused due to injuriesreceived during that assault \u2013 Whether such an act on part of theappellant comes within the parameters of ss.299 and 300 of IPCand whether he is guilty of having committed culpable homicideamounting to murder \u2013 Held: Considering the age of the victim inthe present case, the accused must have known the consequencethat his sexual assault on a child of two-and-a-half-year-old wouldcause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause her death\u2013 The instant matter thus comes within the parameters of clausefourthly to s.300 IPC and the question posed on this issue must beanswered against the appellant \u2013 The appellant is therefore guiltyof having committed the offence of culpable homicide amounting tomurder.Sentence/Sentencing \u2013 Rape and murder of a minor girl \u2013 Atwo-and-a-half-year-old girl was subjected to sexual assault by hermaternal uncle \u2013 Her death was caused due to multiple injuries shereceived during such assault \u2013 The Trial Court found thatcircumstantial evidence established the guilt of the accused \u2013 TheTrial Court by its order awarded death sentence to the appellant ontwo counts, i.e. u/s.302 of IPC and u/s.376-A of the IPC; rigorousimprisonment for life under two counts, i.e. s.376(1)(2)(f), (i) and(m) of IPC and u/s. 6 of POCSO Act \u2013 The death sentence wasconfirmed by the High Court \u2013 On appeal, held: Merely becausethe instant case is based on circumstantial evidence there is no reasonto commute the death sentence \u2013 The matter must be considered tosee whether the circumstantial evidence is of unimpeachablecharacter in establishing guilt of the accused or leads to anexceptional case and also whether the evidence on record is sostrong and convincing that option of a sentence lesser than a deathpenalty is foreclosed \u2013 In the instant case, the circumstances provedon record are clear, consistent and conclusive in nature and are ofunimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the appellant\u2013 The evidence on record also depicts an exceptional case wheretwo and half year old girl was subjected to sexual assault \u2013 However,it cannot be said that the option of a sentence lesser than deathpenalty is completely foreclosed \u2013 A definite pointer in favour ofthe appellant is the fact that he did not consciously cause any injurywith the intent to extinguish the life of the victim \u2013 In matters wherethe conviction is recorded with the aid of clause fourthly u/s. 300 ofIPC, it is very rare that the death sentence is awarded \u2013 In variousSupreme Court decisions, where the victims were below 16 years ofage and had died during the course of sexual assault on them, themaximum sentence awarded was life sentence \u2013 This aspect is veryimportant \u2013 Therefore, the appellant is guilty of the offencepunishable u/s. 302 IPC, since there was no requisite intent as wouldbring the case under any of the first three clauses of s.300 IPC, theoffence in the present case does not deserve death penalty \u2013Appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment for offence punishableu/s.302 IPC \u2013 The second count on which death sentence has beenimposed is u/s. 376A of IPC \u2013 In view of the fact that s.376A IPCwas brought on the statute book just a few days before thecommission of the offence, the appellant does not deserve deathpenalty for said offence \u2013 However, the appropriate punishmentfor the offence u/s. 376A IPC must be rigorous imprisonment for aterm of 25 years \u2013 The conviction and sentence recorded by theCourts below for the offences punishable u/s. 376(1), (2)(f), (i) and(m) of IPC, and u/s.6 of the POCSO Act are affirmed.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.235(2) \u2013 Penal Code, 1860\u2013 s.376(1), (2)(f), (i), (m), s.376-A and s.302 \u2013 Protection of Childrenfrom Sexual Offences Act, 2012 \u2013 s.6 \u2013 Rape and murder of a minorgirl \u2013 Trial Court found appellant-accused guilty \u2013 The Trial Court,by its order passed on the same day awarded death sentence to theappellant on two counts, i.e. u/s.302 of IPC and u/s.376-A of theIPC; rigorous imprisonment for life under two counts, i.e.s.376(1)(2)(f), (i) and (m) of IPC and u/s. 6 of POCSO Act \u2013 Thedeath sentence was confirmed by the High Court \u2013 Before theSupreme Court, the appellant contended that the sentence of deathwas passed on the same day when the conviction order waspronounced, there was non-compliance of s.235(2) of the Code,the infraction on that count was sufficient to consider commutationof the sentence of death to that of life imprisonment \u2013 Held: Merelyon account of infraction of s.235(2) of the Code, the death sentenceought not to be commuted to life imprisonment \u2013 Adequate andsufficient opportunity afforded to the appellant to place all therelevant materials on record in the light of principle laid down inDagdu v. State of Maharashtra.Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.376(1)(2) and s.376A \u2013 Criminal Law(Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 \u2013 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act,2013 \u2013 Rape and murder of a minor girl \u2013 The Trial Court, by itsorder awarded death sentence to the appellant on two counts, i.e.u/s.302 of IPC and u/s.376-A of the IPC; rigorous imprisonmentfor life under two counts, i.e. u/s.376(1)(2)(f), (i) and (m) of IPCand u/s. 6 of POCSO Act \u2013 The Criminal Law (Amendment)Ordinance, 2013 (promulgated by the President of India on03.02.2013), u/s.376(2) prescribed punishment as \u201cshall be punishedwith rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less thanten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life\u201d \u2013 Thesentence prescribed by s.376(2) as amended by the Amendment Act,has for the first time provided that the imprisonment for life \u201cshallmean imprisonment for the remainder of that person\u2019s natural life\u201d\u2013 Whether imposition of life sentence in the instant case for theoffence under u/s.376(2) could \u201cmean imprisonment for theremainder of that person\u2019s natural life\u201d \u2013 Whether such ex-postfacto prescription would be consistent with the provisions of sub-Article (1) of Article 20 of the Constitution \u2013 Held: In the instantcase, the offence was committed on 11.02.2013 when the provisionsof the Ordinance were in force \u2013 However, the Amendment Act havingbeen given retrospective effect from 03.02.2013 \u2013 Since it was theOrdinance which was holding the field, going by the provisions ofthe Ordinance, Clauses (f), (h) and (l) of s.376(2) would getattracted \u2013 As far as consistency of ex-post facto prescription withArt.20(1) is concerned \u2013 An imposition of life sentence simpliciterdoes not put any restraints on the power of the executive to grantremission and commutation in exercise of its statutory power, subjectof course to s.433A of the Code \u2013 But, a statutory prescription thatit \u201cshall mean the remainder of that person\u2019s life\u201d will certainlyrestrain the executive from exercising any such statutory power andto that extent the concerned provision definitely prescribes a higherpunishment ex-post facto \u2013 In the process, the protection affordedby Art.20(1) of the Constitution would stand negated \u2013 Therefore, itis must to declare that the punishment u/s.376(2) of the IPC in thepresent case cannot come with stipulation that the life imprisonment\u201cshall mean the remainder of that person\u2019s life\u201d.Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.299 and s.300 \u2013 Interplay between \u2013discussed.Words and Phrases \u2013 Theory of \u201cResidual Doubt\u201d \u2013discussed."

(ii) the list of documents asked byrespondents to be supplied by SEBI; (iii) Respondents grantedopportunity to file their reply to show cause notice; (iv) SEBI wouldgive an opportunity for personal hearing to both the parties andtake final view of the matter.Natural Justice \u2013 Show cause notice with documents \u2013 Held:The show cause notice should be comprehensive enough with fullsupporting documents being handed over.Natural Justice \u2013 Opportunity to be heard \u2013 Held: Lookinginto the enormity of the contents of the show cause notice runninginto 150 pages with documents spanning 4,000 pages supportingit, a reasonable time had to be given to respond to the same \u2013 Afterhanding over the copies of the documents, the proceedings wereconcluded within the span of two weeks, which cannot be said tobe an adequate opportunity \u2013 An opportunity of hearing is not amere nicety but a valuable right \u2013 That it does not fall in astraitjacket formula is the accepted legal position \u2013 The question iswhether there was substantial compliance of the principles of naturaljustice and whether there were unnecessary adjournments beingsought, which were declined.Company Law \u2013 Corporate veil \u2013 Respondent No.1 is Company(NOL) and respondent No.2 is the founder and CEO of NationalMulti Commodity Exchange India Limited (NMCE) as well asManaging Director of NOL \u2013 Respondent No.2 was served with adetailed show cause notice \u2013 Held: Respondent No.1 herein is aseparate legal entity being a registered company, but the conceptof piercing the veil is not unknown to law \u2013 By this process, the laweither goes behind the corporate personality to the individualmembers or ignores the separate personality of the company \u2013 Thiscourse is adopted when it is found that the principle of corporatepersonality is flagrantly opposed to justice, convenience or theinterest of the Revenue \u2013 This Court is, thus, not able to hold thatthere was a failure to serve show cause notice to respondent No.1herein merely because no such notice was specifically addressed toit."

Educational Service, it was held in no uncertain termsthat the limitation provided in Art.137 governs the application u/s.7 of the Code \u2013 Therefore, the impugned orders deserve to be setaside and the application filed by the respondent no.2 is rejectedas being barred by limitation."

(SIPL) and that a bank by name, JanataSahkari Bank Ltd. had taken possession of the same under theSARFAESI Act \u2013 Financial creditor and Resolution Professional bothfiled separate appeals respectively \u2013 Held: It is not the case ofcorporate debtor or its promoter/Director or anyone else that someof the factors which were crucial for taking a decision regardingviability and feasibility were not placed before the CoC or theResolution Professional \u2013 The only basis for the corporate debtorto raise the issue of viability and feasibility was that the ownershipand possession of the ethanol plant and machinery was the subjectmatter of another dispute and that the Resolution Plan did not takecare of the contingency where the said plant and machinery maynot eventually be available to SRA \u2013 However, records very clearlyshow that SRA, Resolution Professional and financial creditor werefully aware of the said issue \u2013 The order passed by the NCLATshowed that the possession of the ethanol plant and machinery wasrestored to SIPL, in the appeal to which SRA was also a party \u2013 SRAalso appeared to have offered to Janata Sahkari Bank to purchasethe said plant and machinery \u2013 In the appeal before the NCLAT outof which these appeals arose, SIPL which claimed ownership of theethanol plant and machinery, was also a party \u2013 In any case, theResolution Professional took a specific plea in his grounds of appealbefore this Court, that SRA was itself into the ethanol manufacturingbusiness and that they had sufficient ethanol production capacityrequired to fulfil their Resolution Plan \u2013 Therefore, the fact thatthere was an issue with regard to the ethanol plant and machinery,had been taken note of by Resolution Professional, CoC and SRA \u2013Since all these three parties took note of the said fact and took aconscious decision to go ahead with the Resolution Plan, it cannotbe stated that the question of viability and feasibility was notexamined in the proper perspective \u2013 Therefore, the main groundon which NCLAT interfered with the decision of the NCLT to approvethe Resolution Plan, was wholly untenable, misconceived andunjustified."

In judicial review over disciplinary matters \u2013 Held: Two ends of spectrum - First is a rule of restraint founded on deference to the position of the disciplinary authority as a fact finding authority and autonomy of the employer in maintaining discipline and efficiency of the service \u2013 At the other end of the spectrum is the principle that the court has the jurisdiction to interfere when the findings in the enquiry are based on no evidence or when they suffer from perversity \u2013 A failure to consider vital evidence is an incident of what the law regards as a perverse determination of fact \u2013 Service jurisprudence has recognized the authority of the court to interfere when the finding or the penalty are disproportionate to the weight of the evidence or misconduct.

Degree and entered category \u2018D\u2019 of Schedule \u2018F\u2019 \u2013 The dispute arose at the time of appointment of appellant as the Head Master of the school \u2013 Respondent no.1 claimed that he was appointed on regular basis on 01.08.1985 as against appellant who was appointed against a temporary vacancy on 16.07.1985 \u2013 Respondent no.1 contended that he is senior to appellant and in terms of the Rules, he would be entitled to be promoted as Head Master \u2013 The promotion order dated 31.05.2014 promoting appellant as Head Master was challenged in appeal before the School Tribunal and the same was dismissed \u2013 Writ Petition filed by the respondent no.1 was dismissed by the Single Bench of the High Court \u2013 Thereafter, an application for review filed was allowed \u2013 On appeal, held: The judgment in Bhawna v. State of Maharashtra & Ors. is directly applicable to the present case inasmuch as appellant was holding the qualifications of B.A. B.Ed at the time of her initial appointment on 16.07.1985, though she was appointed against a regular vacancy on 24.11.1988 \u2013 However, respondent no.1 was not qualified for appointment as Assistant Teacher as he graduated in science only in the year 1997 and passed B.Ed in 1999 \u2013 He was upgraded to Category \u2018C\u2019 only upon acquiring these qualifications \u2013 Accordingly, the seniority list mentioned respondent no.1\u2019s name at serial no.10 while appellant was placed at serial no.2, though first in Category \u2018C\u2019 \u2013 The school in question is secondary school, therefore clause 2 of Schedule \u2018F\u2019 of the Rules would be referred \u2013 Keeping in view the principle laid down in Vaijanath case, the appellant was qualified for appointment as temporary teacher as she was a graduate and also possessed B.Ed degree \u2013 Her appointment was in accordance with s.5(5) of the Act \u2013 However, the respondent no.1 could not be treated to be part of Category \u2018C\u2019 from the date of his initial appointment i.e. 01.08.1985 as he was neither a graduate nor a trained teacher when he was appointed \u2013 Also, respondent no.1 was not even a trained teacher on the date of his appointment and thus cannot claim seniority on such ground from the date of his initial appointment \u2013 Therefore, the judgment of High Court in review cannot be sustained in law and the same is set aside.
