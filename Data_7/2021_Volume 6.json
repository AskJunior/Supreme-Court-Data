Enactment of the 2019 Act by the State legislature \u2013 Legislative competence of \u2013 State legislature enacted three State land acquisition statutes-the 1978 Act, the 1997 Act and the 2001 Act \u2013 Union legislature thereafter enacted the 2013 Act for land acquisition across the country \u2013 Repugnancy between the Union and State enactments \u2013 In view thereof, Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2014 was effected to the 2013 Act whereby s. 105-A inserted in the 2013 Act, making the provisions of the 2013 Act inapplicable to acquisition of land under the three State enactments \u2013 Thereafter, the 2014 Act, along with the 1997 Act and 2001 Act, challenged before the High Court on the grounds of repugnancy with the 2013 Act and violation of Article 14 \u2013 High Court struck down and declared all three State laws to be void for repugnancy and set aside all land acquisitions thereunder post coming into effect of the 2013 Act \u2013 To protect the nullified State enactments, the State legislature brought the 2019 Act \u2013 2019 Act was applied retrospectively from 26.09.2013 with the objective to validate all pending acquisitions on and after that date under the State enactments, otherwise quashed by the High Court \u2013 State legislature enacting the 2019 Act, if transgressed the limits of its legislative competence having the effect of nullifying/overruling the judgment of the High Court \u2013 Held: Legislative intent behind the 2019 Act and more particularly, the assent accorded thereto by the Governor and the President of India for overcoming repugnancy with the Act made by the Parliament, was to revive the operation of the State enactments declared as null and void being unconstitutional and repugnant to the Act made by the Parliament and to amend the same, as well as, validate the actions already taken by the State authorities \u2013 Concerned constitutional bodies understood the substance of what is placed before them \u2013 Concern is with the substance of the legislature and not its form \u2013 2019 Act is a conscious attempt by the State legislature to bring four material aspects of land acquisition under the three State enactments at par with the 2013 Act-compensation, rehabilitation, resettlement and infrastructure facilities \u2013 Effect of the 2019 Act is to change the law retrospectively and not to overrule the judgment of the Court \u2013 There is no irreconcilability between the High Court judgment and the 2019 Act \u2013 Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 \u2013 Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Harijan Welfare Schemes Act, 1978 \u2013 Tamil Nadu Acquisition of Land for Industrial Purposes Act, 1997 \u2013 Tamil Nadu Highways Act, 2001 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 254. Retrospective commencement of date of 2019 Act \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: A law is said to be made on the day it obtains Presidential assent u/Art. 111 or u/Art. 254 or of Governor u/Art. 200 \u2013 Commencement of law, unlike making of law, is not a part of the legislative process \u2013 For checking repugnancy, the relevant point of time would be the date of assent and not date of commencement \u2013 It may appear anomalous to operationalise the 2019 Act from 26.09.2013, a day prior to the making of the 2013 Act, but it does not make any impact on the validity thereof or its substance \u2013 Date has been chosen by the State legislature only by way of abundant caution and, rightly \u2013 It is relevant to overcome the repugnancy corresponding to the commencement of the 2013 Act \u2013 Adopting any other interpretation would not only be unwarranted but would also strike at the very purpose of a retrospective reviving and validating enactment \u2013 Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013\u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 254. Presidential assent u/Art. 254(2) \u2013 Requirement of \u2013 Plea that that the actual repugnancy was not pointed out to the President while obtaining assent and thus, requirements of Art.254(2) unfilled \u2013 Held: Letter written by the State Government seeking presidential assent clearly demonstrates the communication was in compliance with the mandate of Art. 254 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 254. Retrospective operation: Retrospective operation of a statute \u2013 Concept of \u2013 Held: Retrospectivity is to cure including validate certain transactions of the past by making a law in the present and not to compete with the laws existing in the past at that point of time. Enactment of a retrospective validating Act \u2013 Legislative competence of the State legislature \u2013 Held: When voidness is a result of repugnancy between the State law and law made by the Parliament, the State legislature can revive of such State law by enacting a subsequent amendment substantively changing the basis of the voidness and applying it retrospectively from a prior date. Constitution of India:Art. 254 \u2013 Concept of repugnancy and its functioning under \u2013 Explained."

XXIII provides that where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that a suit has been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise, the Court shall order such agreement or compromise to be recorded and pass a decree in accordance therewith \u2013 r.3 uses the expression \u201clawful agreement or compromise\u201d \u2013 A conjoint reading of ss.10, 13 and 14 of Indian Contract Act indicates that when consent is obtained by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, such consent is not free consent and the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party whose consent was caused due to coercion, fraud or misrepresentation \u2013 An agreement, which is void or voidable under the Indian Contract Act, shall not be deemed to be lawful as is provided by Explanation to r.3 of Or.XXIII \u2013 Contract Act, 1872. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or.XXIII r.3A \u2013 In the plaint, plaintiff pleaded that compromise recorded on 06.08.1984 was not lawful compromise having been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation \u2013 Plaintiff\u2019s case was that they were represented by D1 that the compromise was entered only to save the family property since the plaintiff has given personal guarantee to the Bank for obtaining loan for business \u2013 Pleadings clearly made out the case of the plaintiff that the consent which he gave for compromise by signing the compromise deed was not free consent \u2013 The compromise, thus, became voidable at the instance of the plaintiff \u2013 Thus, bar under r.3A shall be attracted. Consent decree: Challenge against \u2013 A party to a consent decree based on a compromise to challenge the compromise decree on the ground that the decree was not lawful, i.e., it was void or voidable has to approach the same court, which recorded the compromise and a separate suit challenging the consent decree has been held to be not maintainable. Hindu law: Joint Hindu Family \u2013 Under Hindu Law, any member of the joint family can separate himself from joint family \u2013 The intention of the parties to terminate the status of joint family is a relevant factor to determine the status of Hindu Undivided Family \u2013 In the instant case, real intendment of three branches to partition their properties was not that they did not want Hindu Undivided Family to continue rather the said partition was with object to get away from application of Land Ceiling Act, 1961 \u2013 Partition Deed dated 07.11.1960 being a registered Partition Deed between three branches, the same cannot be ignored \u2013 Properties admittedly were divided in three branches by the said partition \u2013 However even after 07.11.1960, the family continued as a Joint Family \u2013 There was reunion between three brothers to revert to the status of Joint Hindu Family, which is amply proved from the acts and conducts of the parties subsequent to 07.11.1960 \u2013 The purchase of various immovable properties in the names of the three branches clearly indicated the intention that all the three branches were joint and they were purchasing the properties in the name of all the three branches \u2013 Plaintiff never admitted the agreement dated 08.03.1981 or alleged partition of 08.03.1981 \u2013 It is, thus, clear that parties remained joint and properties standing in the names of three branches remained joint till the consent decree was passed on 06.08.1984 \u2013 Thus, in the year 1979 when residential property of Tatabad was obtained in the name of defendant No.1, all three branches were part of the joint Hindu family and the house property purchased in the name of one member of joint Hindu family was for the benefit of all \u2013 Both the Courts below although accepted the partition dated 18.03.1981 as pleaded by D-1 but erred in not considering the consequence of such pleading \u2013 When partition of all immovable and movable properties is claimed on 08.03.1981, the conclusion is irresistible that the family was joined till then \u2013 Thus, the theory set up by D-1 that all the three branches were separate after 07.11.1960 is denied/belied by claim of partition on 08.03.1981."

        "HeadNote": "Maharashtra Public Trust Act, 1950 \u2013 Tender \u2013 In 2015, a tender notice was issued by the first respondent-registered charitable trust inviting bids for the development of the property \u2013 Bids were tendered by the appellant and the second respondent \u2013 There were various rounds of litigation between the first respondent, second respondent, third respondent-Joint Charity Commissioner and the appellant regarding the bids offered \u2013 In 2021, the appellant filed an intervention application in the writ proceedings, alleging collusion between the first and second respondent for the sale of the said property \u2013 Appellant offered an amount of Rs. 75 lakhs for the property \u2013 However, appellant did not abide by its offer despite various opportunities given by the High Court \u2013 Thereafter, second respondent made an offer of Rs.80 lakhs and accordingly, the High Court directed to complete the transaction with the second respondent \u2013 Before the Supreme Court, the appellant submitted that he was ready with Rs. 75 lakhs and High Court should have granted further extension of time \u2013 On 18.03.2021, the appellant was directed to deposit Rs.1 crore in the High Court to his bona fides and the same was complied with \u2013 It was contended by the second respondent that all along, it was second respondent who has participated in the process of auction sale and the appellant had failed to avail of the opportunities which were granted by the High Court \u2013 It was urged that having regard to the principles of law which have evolved by the judgments of the Supreme Court, it would be necessary to reject the offer which is now made by the appellant and to award the property to the second respondent \u2013 Held: At the present time, the appellant has deposited an amount of Rs. 1 crore before the High Court \u2013 To accept the bid of the second respondent in the amount of Rs. 80 lakhs will deprive the trust of the opportunity of realising the full market value \u2013 The decision of the High Court to award the sale in favour of the second respondent would cause serious jeopardy to the interests of the public charitable trust \u2013 The manner in which the second respondent has increased his offer in driblets (from Rs.50 lakhs to Rs.75 lakhs and thereafter, to Rs.80 lakhs) leads to a reasonable inference that the true value of the property was not realized \u2013 The appropriate direction would be to require the third respondent to conduct the auction process by inviting fresh bids after a proper valuation \u2013 Accordingly, directions issued."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.31(1) \u2013 Held: s.31(1) vests complete discretion with the Court to order the sentences for two or more offences at one trial to run concurrently having regard to the nature of offences and the surrounding factors \u2013 There cannot be any straitjacket approach in the matter of exercise of such discretion by the Court; but this discretion has to be judiciously exercised with reference to the nature of the offence/s committed and the facts and circumstances of the case \u2013 However, if the sentences (other than life imprisonment) are not provided to run concurrently, one would run after the other, in such order as the Court may direct. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.220 \u2013 The \u2018single transaction\u2019 principle is essentially referable to s.220 which provides that if more offences than one are committed in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, then the accused may be charged with and tried at one trial for every such offence \u2013 In a given case, after such trial for multiple offences, if the accused is convicted and awarded different punishments, concurrent running thereof may be provided depending on the facts and the relevant surrounding factors."

        "HeadNote": "Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.96; Or.7 r.11 \u2013 Rejection of plaint \u2013 Writ petition by plaintiff challenging the order of trial court allowing the application filed under Or.7 r.11 \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 Held: The definition of \u201cdecree\u201d in s.2(2) \u201cshall be deemed to include the rejection of a plaint\u201d \u2013 Hence, the order of trial court rejecting the plaint is subject to a first appeal under s.96 of the CPC \u2013 Writ petition by plaintiff liable to be rejected on that ground \u2013 Writ jurisdiction. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or.7 r.11 \u2013 Trial court allowed the application filed under Or.7 r.11 \u2013 However, while doing so, plaintiff was directed to seek proper relief and pay court fee thereon within 15 days otherwise appropriate order would be passed \u2013 Defendants challenged the order of trial court in so far as it permitted the plaintiff to carry out an amendment of seeking appropriate relief \u2013 High Court allowed the revision petition filed by defendants on the ground that since the plaint was rejected under Or.7 r.11, there was no occasion to direct that an amendment be made to the plaint \u2013 Held: The proviso to Or.7 r.11 deals with a situation where time has been fixed by the Court for correction of valuation or for supplying of the requisite stamp paper \u2013 Under the proviso, the time so fixed shall not be extended unless the court, for reasons to be recorded, is satisfied that the plaintiff was prevented by a cause of an exceptional nature from complying within the time fixed by the court and that a refusal to extend time would cause grave injustice to the plaintiff \u2013 The proviso evidently covers the cases falling within the ambit of clauses (b) and (c) and has no application to a rejection of a plaint under Or.7 r.11(d) \u2013 In the circumstances, the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the further direction that was issued by trial judge was not in consonance with law."

A Judiciary: Independence of judiciary \u2013 Judicial independence of the district judiciary is cardinal to the integrity of the entire system \u2013 If the faith of the citizen in the administration of justice has to be preserved, it is to the district judiciary that attention must be focused as well as the \u2018higher\u2019 judiciary \u2013 The district judiciary operates under the administrative supervision of the High Court which must secure and enhance its independence from external influence and control \u2013 This compartmentalization of the judiciary and executive should not be breached by interfering with the personal decision- making of the judges and the conduct of court proceedings under them."

        "HeadNote": "Housing: Residential project \u2013 Project to be developed by the Company concerned was widely advertised through brochures and advertisements as \u2018Amrapali La Residentia\u2019 project, promising delivery of apartments within 36 months \u2013 Claim of flat buyers \u2013 Writ Petition filed in Supreme Court submitting that amounts invested by the apartment holders were siphoned away by the Amrapali Group of Companies \u2013 While entertaining the writ petitions, Supreme Court directed audit by forensic auditors \u2013 Observations of forensic auditor quoted with approval by Supreme Court in its Judgment dated 23.07.2019 \u2013 Another order dated 14.10.2019 subsequently passed by Supreme Court \u2013 Prayer in interim applications either seeking recall of Supreme Court orders dated 23.07.2019 and 14.10.2019 or revisit of the issue whether the Company ought to be declared as part of the Amrapali Group of Companies \u2013 Tenability \u2013 Held: Not tenable, more particularly because of the developments with respect to the instant project \u2013 Unlike all the other projects of the Amrapali Group which were made over to the NBCC, the development with respect to the instant project has always been an on-going process \u2013 Further, if the instant project is now handed over to the NBCC, it would result in escalation in costs to the detriment of the flat buyers \u2013 That apart, the interest of the Amrapali Group of Companies and consequently that of the flat buyers who had invested money in other Amrapali Projects already stood quantified at 19.75% by Orders dated 23.07.2019 and 14.10.2019 \u2013 Considering all the features of the matter, it would not be just and proper to hand over the development at this stage to the NBCC \u2013 It would not be appropriate to recall the orders dated 23.07.2019 and 14.10.2019 or to revisit the issue whether the Company could be declared to be part of the Amrapali Group of Companies \u2013 However, directions passed to secure the amounts receivable by Amrapali Group of Companies through the instant project \u2013 Applications under consideration accordingly disposed of."

Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 ss. 12, 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 19, 46 and 48 \u2013 Prayer for directions to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA)/Central Government/State Governments to provide ex gratia monetary compensation to the families of the deceased persons who succumbed to the pandemic of Covid-19 \u2013 Whether a writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/National Authority/State Governments to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance, more particularly Rs. 4 lacs, as prayed by the petitioners \u2013 Whether the Court can/may direct to pay a particular amount by way of ex gratia assistance \u2013 Held: The Government should be free to take policy decisions/decide priorities (of course to achieve the ultimate goal of DMA 2005, government should be free to take its own decisions/priorities while providing minimum standards of relief and even towards preparedness, mitigation, prevention and recovery), subject to the availability of the resources/ funds and the amount to be spent towards other reliefs on the aid and advice of the experts and looking to the circumstances from time to time \u2013 Therefore, no relief can be granted to direct the National Authority/Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular amount towards ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 \u2013 Some States are paying ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic \u2013 However, the same is paid from the Chief Minister Relief Fund or other relief funds, but not from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) \u2013 To avoid any heart-burning and discriminatory treatment, it would be appropriate for the National Authority to recommend uniform guidelines while providing for the minimum standards of relief in the form of ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life, as mandated under s.12 of the Act \u2013 However, at the same time, it will always be open for the concerned States to provide for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life and other reliefs from their own relief funds (other than SDRF) as it would be a policy decision by the concerned States and they may provide such other relief/reliefs, looking to the availability of the fund \u2013 However, merely because some States might have been paying the ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life to the family members of the persons who have died due to Covid-19 pandemic, no writ of mandamus can be issued directing the Central Government/State Governments to pay a particular sum/amount by way of ex gratia assistance as the utilization of the fund/money by the Central Government would depend upon the priorities fixed by them which includes the money/ fund to be used for prevention, preparedness, mitigation, recovery etc. \u2013 Therefore, what amount to be paid by way of ex gratia assistance to the family members of the persons who died due to Covid-19 pandemic should be left to the National Authority/Central Government. Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 ss. 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 12, 19, 46 and 48 \u2013 Prayer for directions to the respondents/State Governments to fulfill their obligation(s) to take care of victims of the calamity and their family members \u2013 Held: The prayer is too vague \u2013 Even otherwise, considering the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India it demonstrates the various reliefs declared by the Union Government \u2013 As such, no mandamus can be issued directing the respondents \u2013 State Governments to declare a particular policy / relief/relief package in general and the same shall be within the domain of policy decision and would have financial implications also. Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 ss. 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 12, 19, 46 and 48 \u2013 Prayer for directions to respondents-State Governments to issue any official document stating cause of death, to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 \u2013 Held: It is the duty of the every authority to issue accurate/correct death certificates stating the correct and accurate cause of death, so that the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 may not face any difficulty in getting the benefits of the schemes that may be declared by the Government for the death of the deceased, who died due to Covid- 19 \u2013 In the death certificate also, if a person has died due to Covid- 19 and/or any other complications/disease due to Covid-19, it should be specifically mentioned in the death certificate \u2013 The procedure should be as simplified as it can be \u2013 Appropriate Authority directed to issue simplified guidelines for issuance of Death Certificates/ official document stating the exact cause of death, i.e., \u201cDeath due to Covid-19\u201d, to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 \u2013 Such guidelines may also provide the remedy to the family members of the deceased who died due to Covid-19 for correction of the death certificate/official document issued by the appropriate authority, if they are not satisfied with the cause of death mentioned in the death certificate/official document issued by the appropriate authority. Covid-19 Pandemic: Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 ss. 2(d), 2(e), 2(i), 2(m), 6, 10, 12, 19, 46 and 48 \u2013 Prayer for directions to the respondents-Union of India and others to provide social security and rehabilitation to the victims of Covid-19 \u2013 Held: From the XVth Finance Commission Report, it appears that the Finance Commission in its report has already made recommendations of the same and from the counter affidavit it appears that the Union Government has been actively considering the same in consultation with other stakeholders \u2013 Even otherwise, from the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Union of India, it appears that the Central Government has already launched the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package under which a comprehensive personal accident cover of Rs. 50 lakhs have been provided to 22.12 lakh health care providers throughout the country, including community health workers and private health workers who may have been in direct contact and care of Covid-19 patients and may be at risk of being impacted/infected by this \u2013 It is further reported that on account of unprecedented situation, private hospital staff/retired/volunteer/local urban bodies/contract/daily wage/ad-hoc/outsourced staff requisitioned by States/Central Hospitals/ autonomous hospitals of Central /States/Union Territories, AIIMS & Institute of National Importance (INI)/hospitals of Central Ministries specifically drafted for care of Covid-19 patients are also covered under the scheme \u2013 The benefits under the said scheme have been extended for a further period of 180 days with effect from 24.04.2021 \u2013 Therefore, it appears that sufficient care has been taken \u2013 However, some class might have been left out, like those persons working at pre-mortem \u2013 Thus, the Union Government may look into the same and cover them also who might have been left out and who can be said to be in direct contact of dead bodies of Covid-19 patients \u2013 The Union of India to take appropriate steps on the recommendations made by the Finance Commission in its XVth Finance Commission Report bearing in mind paragraph 8.131 in consultation with other stakeholders and experts. Disaster Management Act, 2005: Enactment of \u2013 Object and purpose \u2013 Discussed. Administrative Law: Policy decision \u2013 Interference with \u2013 Scope \u2013 Held: When the Government forms its policy, it is based on a number of circumstances, on facts, law including constraint based governmental resources \u2013 The Government is entitled to make pragmatic adjustments which may be called for by particular circumstances \u2013 The function of the Court is to see that lawful authority is not abused but not to appropriate to itself the task entrusted to that authority \u2013 Therefore, the Courts would be very slow to interfere with priorities fixed by the government in providing reliefs, unless it is patently arbitrary and/or not in the larger public interest at all \u2013 Judicial Review. Judicial Review: Scope of \u2013 Writ of Mandamus \u2013 When can be issued \u2013 Held: If the statutory authority/authority fails to perform its statutory duty cast under the statute or constitutional duty, a mandamus can be issued directing the authority to perform its duty cast under the statute \u2013 In such a situation, the Court would be absolutely justified in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the authority to perform its statutory duty/constitutional duty. Interpretation of Statutes: Plain meaning \u2013 Held: When the language of the provision is plain and unambiguous, statutory enactments must ordinarily be construed according to its plain meaning. Interpretation of Statutes: Beneficial provision \u2013 Held: The beneficial provision of the legislation must be literally construed so as to fulfill the statutory purpose and not to frustrate it."

        "HeadNote": "Service Law \u2013 Superannuation \u2013 Enhancement of Superannuation age \u2013 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA) constituted under provisions of the Act of 1976 \u2013 On 30 September 2012, Government of Uttar Pradesh acceded to a proposal of the Appellant-NOIDA to enhance the age of superannuation of its employees from fifty-eight to sixty years, prospectively \u2013 High Court set aside the decision of the State government to give prospective effect and in exercise of its power of judicial review u/Art.226 of the Constitution directed that retrospective effect be given to the Government Order from 29 September 2002 \u2013 Whether High Court transcended the limits of its power of judicial review \u2013 Held: High Court trenched upon the realm of policy making and assumed to itself, jurisdiction over a matter which lies in the domain of the executive \u2013 Whether the age of superannuation should be increased and if so, the date from which this should be effected is a matter of policy into which the High Court ought not to have entered \u2013 Whether the decision to increase the age of superannuation should date back to the resolution passed by NOIDA or should be made effective from the date of the approval by the State government was a matter for the State government to decide \u2013 Ultimately, in drawing every cut-off, some employees would stand on one side of the line while the others would be positioned otherwise \u2013 This element of hardship cannot be a ground for the High Court to hold that the decision was arbitrary \u2013 The proposal of NOIDA could not have given rise to a legitimate expectation since it was a mere recommendation which was subject to the approval of the State Government \u2013 Respondent- employees could not have claimed a vested right that the enhancement in the age of retirement should be made effective from the date on which NOIDA had resolved to submit a proposal for the approval of the government \u2013 U.P. Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 \u2013 s.19 \u2013 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority Service Regulations, 1981 \u2013 Regn.25 \u2013 Doctrine of legitimate expectation \u2013 Inapplicability of \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.226 \u2013 Judicial Review. Doctrines/Principles: Principle of promissory estoppel \u2013 When applicable and when not applicable \u2013 Held: For the principle of promissory estoppel to apply, one party must have made an unequivocal promise, intending to create or affect a legal relationship between the parties \u2013 The principle of promissory estoppel will not apply if the communication issued was either a proposal or a recommendation. Doctrines/Principles: Doctrine of legitimate expectation \u2013 Held: The doctrine of legitimate expectation is grounded in fairness and reasonableness \u2013 There is a legitimate expectation that the actions of the State are fair and reasonable. Government Orders/Notifications/Circulars: Government order \u2013 When retrospectively applicable \u2013 Held: Government order can be given retrospective application only if expressly stated or inferred through necessary implication.

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Split multiplier \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 At the time of calculation of the income, the Court has to consider the actual income of the deceased and addition should be made to take into account future prospects \u2013 While the evidence in a given case may indicate a different percentage of increase, standardization of the addition for future prospects should be made to avoid different yardsticks being applied or different methods of calculation being adopted \u2013 In Pranay Sethi, the Constitution Bench has directed addition of 15% of the salary in case the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years as a thumb rule, where a deceased had a permanent job \u2013 In view of that, High Court was not justified in applying split multiplier in the instant case. B Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: s.166 \u2013 Deceased aged 52 years at the time of his death and having a permanent job \u2013 Applicable multiplier is \u201811\u2019 \u2013 15% of his actual salary should be added towards future prospectus \u2013 Four dependents left behind by the deceased \u2013 Hence, 1/4 th of the income (actual salary + future prospects) should be deducted towards his personal expenses \u2013 In Pranay Sethi, this Court has awarded a total sum of Rs.70,000/- under conventional heads, namely, loss of estate, loss of consortium and funeral expenses and the said sum should be enhanced at the rate of 10% in every three years \u2013 The judgment in Pranay Sethi was rendered in the year 2017 \u2013 Therefore, in the instant case, the claimants are entitled for 10% enhancement."
