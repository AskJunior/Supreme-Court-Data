State Garden Department \u2013 Said grove was rent free grant of the defendant-appellant by the ruler of erstwhile Rampur State and was later resumed by the successor in 1930 and thereafter, came in the hands of the State of U.P. however, the appellant managed to get her name continued in the revenue record though her possession was removed \u2013 Plea of the appellant that they were throughout in possession and, as such, had perfected her right, title and interest on the coming of the 1952 Act; and that in a previous proceeding State acquiesced to the defendant\u2019s title \u2013 Trial court decreed the suit in favour of the respondent \u2013 Also, in the first appeal and second appeal, the order of the trial court upheld \u2013 On appeal, held: Neither any order resuming the earlier grant nor any order of the revenue court to show that the said resumption of land had been incorporated in the revenue records was filed \u2013 Only evidence led by the respondent was filing of a true copy of Muafiat Register and the statement of PW-2, clerk working in the revenue department, which is not free from suspicion and cannot be relied upon \u2013 There was no evidence to prove the resumption of the grant \u2013 Furthermore, respondent led no evidence to establish possession since 1930 after the resumption \u2013 Courts below have proceeded on assumptions and presumptions to hold in favour of the State \u2013 Appellants had filed not only documentary evidence to prove their continuous possession but also oral evidence, which was ignored \u2013 Thus, the High Court erred in not taking into consideration the relevant material and instead relied upon inadmissible evidences \u2013 Even the burden of proof has been wrongly placed on the appellant \u2013 Thus, the order passed by the High Court is set aside and the  matter is remitted to High Court \u2013 U.P.

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.100 \u2013 In the State of Haryana, a court in second appeal is not required to formulate a substantial question of law, as what is applicable in Haryana is s.41 of the Punjab Courts Act, 1918 and not s.100 of CPC \u2013 Punjab Courts Act, 1918 \u2013 s.41.

Possession \u2013Adverse Possession \u2013 Ouster \u2013 Possession of a co-owner however long it may be hardly by itself will constitute ouster - In the case of co-owner, it is presumed that he possesses the property on behalf of the entire body of co-owners - Even non- participation of rent and profits by itself need not amount to ouster- The proof of the ingredients of adverse possession are indispensable even in a plea of ouster - There is the additional requirement in the case of ouster that the elements of adverse possession must be shown to have been made known to the co-owner - This is apparently for the reason that the possession of a co-owner is treated as possession of other co-owners \u2013 The very essence of adverse possession and ouster lies in a party setting up a hostile title in himself - The possession of a co-owner is ordinarily on his behalf and also on behalf of the entire body of the co-owners - In the case of an ouster, the co-owner must indeed have the hostile animus - He must assert a title which is not referable to lawful title.

Writs \u2013 Writ of Quo Warranto \u2013 Held: The writ of quo warranto can be issued where an appointment has not been made in accordance with the law \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Article 226 \u2013 Service Law \u2013 Appointment. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Where there is a specific provision, it is not open to the State government to conjure up a lacunae or omission and purportedly exercise the power to remove difficulties \u2013 Misusing the limited power granted to make minor adaptations and peripheral adjustments in a statute for making its implementation effective, to side-step the provisions of the statute altogether would defeat the purpose of the legislation. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 A statute must be read to avoid a construction which would make certain provisions or terms meaningless or redundant \u2013 An effort must be made to read the provisions of the statute in a holistic manner so as to imbue it with meaning and content.

        "HeadNote": " Review \u2013 Clarification sought on quantum of sentence \u2013 In judgment dated 19.04.2022 for which review is sought, the petitioner-accused was held guilty and punished for the offences was under ss.376(2)(i), 376(2)(m) and under s.376(A) of IPC as also under s.5 (i) and s.5 (m) read with s.6 of the POCSO Act \u2013 In judgment dated 19.04.2022, the Court, while commuting the sentence of death for the sentence of life imprisonment for the offence punishable under s.302 of IPC, and while imposing sentence to undergo imprisonment for 20 years and not imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life for the offence under s.376A, IPC tried to balance the scales of retributive justice and restorative justice \u2013 If the sentence of life imprisonment was imposed by the Sessions Court and confirmed by the High Court, and also by this Court, then the life imprisonment would mean imprisonment for the remainder of the petitioner\u2019s (original appellant\u2019s) natural life \u2013 The Court had consciously imposed the sentence of 20 years for the offence under s.376A \u2013 Therefore appellant-petitioner shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 20 years for the offence \u2013 The sentence imposed for the offence under ss.376(2)(i) and 376(2)(m) of IPC and for the offence under ss.5(i) and 5(m) read with s.6 of the POCSO Act is modified, so as to commensurate the said sentences with the sentence imposed for the offence under s.376(A) of IPC, and accordingly sentence is imposed directing the petitioner to undergo imprisonment for a period of twenty years instead of life imprisonment for the said offences \u2013 The judgment and order dated 19.04.2022 is accordingly corrected and modified to that extent.

        "HeadNote": " Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 ss. 2(1)(u), 3, and 4 \u2013 Prosecution case was that A-1 was Additional Commissioner of Income Tax \u2013 On intelligence, the CBI checked a car that was parked in front of the house of A1 and recovered a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- in cash \u2013 It is alleged that A1 and A3 were in that car at that time \u2013 During investigation, it came to light that the sum of Rs.50,00,000/- was handed over to A-1 by A-2 whose income tax file was pending with A1 for clearance \u2013 Since A-2 wanted certain benefits, he had allegedly paid the sum of Rs.50,00,000/- as bribe to A1 \u2013 In connection with this seizure, case was registered under s.120- B IPC and ss.7, 12, 13(1)(d) r/w s.13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, s.3 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 against A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5 and A6 \u2013 A-2 filed writ petition before High Court for quashing the proceedings on the ground that the amount in question as long as it was in the hands of respondent could not be said to be tainted money; that it assumed such character only after it was received by the public servant and as such respondent could not be proceeded against under the provisions of PML Act \u2013 High Court allowed writ petition and quashed the proceedings in PML Act against the respondent \u2013 On State\u2019s appeal, held: The definition of \u201cproceeds of crime\u201d in PML Act, inter alia, means any property derived or obtained by any person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence \u2013 The offences punishable under ss.7, 12 and 13 are scheduled offences \u2013 Any property thus derived as a result of criminal activity relating to offence mentioned in paragraph 8 of Part-A of the Schedule would certainly be \u201cproceeds of crime\u201d \u2013 It is true that so long as the amount is in the hands of a bribe giver, and till it does not get impressed with the requisite intent and is actually handed over as a bribe, it would definitely be untainted money \u2013 If the money is handed over without such intent, it would be a mere entrustment \u2013 If it is thereafter appropriated by the public servant, the offence would be of misappropriation or species thereof but certainly not of bribe \u2013 The crucial part therefore is the requisite intent to hand over the amount as bribe and normally such intent must necessarily be antecedent or prior to the moment the amount is handed over \u2013 Thus, the requisite intent would always be at the core before the amount is handed over \u2013 Such intent having been entertained well before the amount is actually handed over, the person concerned would certainly be involved in the process or activity connected with \u201cproceeds of crime\u201d including inter alia, the aspects of possession or acquisition thereof \u2013 By handing over money with the intent of giving bribe, such person will be assisting or will knowingly be a party to an activity connected with the proceeds of crime \u2013 Without such active participation on part of the person concerned, the money would not assume the character of being proceeds of crime \u2013 The relevant expressions from s.3 of the PML Act are thus wide enough to cover the role played by such person \u2013 A bare perusal of complaint made by the Enforcement Directorate showed that the respondent was prima facie involved in the activity connected with the proceeds of crime.
