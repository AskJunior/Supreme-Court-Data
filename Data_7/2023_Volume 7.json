Witnesses \u2013 Chance witness \u2013 Reliability of \u2013 Held: The law is settled, which is, evidence of a chance witness requires a very cautious and close scrutiny and a chance witness must adequately explain his presence at the place of occurrence \u2013 Deposition of chance witness whose presence at the place of incident remains doubtful should be discarded.

an uninterrupted and subsisting relationshipof lessor and lessee between the State Government and either JKSLor Respondent No. 1, in the context of LIA, Kota \u2013 From the firstlease deed executed in 1967, till date, the State Government hasmaintained the position of lessor \u2013 The lease with JKSL, and allleases thereafter with JKSL and/or Respondent No. 1, have beensigned under the 1959 Rules \u2013 The terms of the lease are clearly incompliance with the 1959 Rules \u2013 The land in LIA, Kota was nevertransferred to RIICO under the Government Order dated 18.09.1979\u2013 The State Government has always maintained title and ownershipof the area \u2013 The land was also never allotted to RIICO on a leasehold basis under Rule 11A of the 1959 Rules \u2013 Thus, RIICOwas never expressly given any leasehold rights, and had no authorityto further sub-lease the land, along with other correspondingpowers, under Rule 12 of the 1959 Rules \u2013 In any case, Rule 11A ofthe 1959 Rules is of no importance, as there had to be an expressallotment of the land to RIICO on a leasehold basis after the cominginto force of Rules 11A and 12 \u2013 No such express allocation wasever made in favour of RIICO \u2013 The 1979 Rules are not statutory innature \u2013 The reference to the 1979 Rules in Rule 12 of the 1959Rules, does not accord any statutory recognition to the former \u2013There was no violation of the Principles of Natural Justice in thiscase \u2013 The entire basis for granting permission for conversion ofthe land, and subdivision of the plots, was on an incorrect assumptionof power by RIICO under the 1979 Rules, to act as the lessor ofLIA, Kota \u2013 RIICO was never given any leasehold rights over theland \u2013 When the basis for a benefit received by a party is itselfinvalid, there is no question of giving the party a chance to beheard \u2013 The State Government was competent to issue directionsunder Art.138 of the AoA of RIICO, to cancel the supplementarylease deeds and attendant permissions \u2013 This fell squarely withinthe ambit of Art.138 of the Articles of Association \u2013 There was noviolation of the Rajasthan Rules of Business as the sub-committeewhich recommended the cancellation of the permissions /approvalsto Respondent No.1, was acting for and on behalf of the entireCouncil of Ministers \u2013 Hence, the Rules of Business were compliedwith \u2013 There was no legitimate expectation nor promissory estoppelthat could operate to the benefit of Respondent No. 1, as, onceagain, no such defences could be raised on the back of RIICO\u2019sown erroneous utilization of powers that vest only with the rightfullessor of LIA, Kota, which is the State Government \u2013 Further, publicinterest overrides both these doctrines, and cannot come to the aidof a private party, when the larger interests of society are involved\u2013 The supplementary leases signed between Respondent No.1 andRIICO are unsustainable \u2013 RIICO did not possess the authority toenter into these agreements, as the land in LIA, Kota remained underthe ownership and control of the State Government uninterruptedlyfrom the first lease signed with JKSL, till the present date \u2013Respondent No.1 was also cognizant of this fact as evinced by itentering into the 7 transfer lease deeds with the Collector, Kota, in 2007, after it stepped into the shoes of JKSL \u2013 The leases withJKSL were executed under the 1959 Rules which remained applicableand there was no authority ever vested in RIICO to have issued thepermissions for conversion and sub-division of plots in the LIA,Kota, and for signing the supplementary lease deeds withRespondent No.1 \u2013 There is no legal infirmity in the action of theAppellants in setting aside the decisions taken by RIICO or indirecting to cancel the supplementary leases of 2018 \u2013 Hence, thecancellation of the supplementary deeds and quashing of theapprovals for conversion of land and sub-division of plots is upheld\u2013 This shall, however, not preclude Respondent No.1 from reapproachingthe State Government and seeking conversion of theusage of land and attendant approvals under the 1959 Rules \u2013 TheState Government shall be at liberty to consider such a proposal inpublic interest and in accordance with the 1959 Rules \u2013 With regardto the Appellant Unions, it would be open for them to seek theirremedies under law from the Appropriate Government, and judicialforums \u2013 Rajasthan Land Revenue Act, 1956 \u2013 s.100 \u2013 RajasthanIndustrial

Nagaraja judgment was delivered cannotbe equated with the present situation \u2013 The Supreme Court cannotcome to the conclusion that in the changed circumstances,absolutely no pain or suffering would be inflicted upon the bullswhile holding these sports \u2013 But the Court is satisfied that the largepart of pain inflicting practices, as they prevailed in the mannerthese three sports were performed in the pre-amendment period havebeen substantially diluted by the introduction of these statutoryinstruments.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 \u2013 Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 \u2013 Is the TamilNadu Amendment Act referable, in pith and substance, to Entry 17,List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India, or doesit further and perpetuate cruelty to animals; and can it, therefore,be said to be a measure of prevention of cruelty to animals? Is itcolourable legislation which does not relate to any Entry in theState List or Entry 17 of the Concurrent List \u2013 Held: The Tamil NaduAmendment Act is not a piece of colourable legislation \u2013 It relates,in pith and substance, to Entry 17 of List III of Seventh Schedule tothe Constitution of India \u2013 It minimises cruelty to animals in theconcerned sports and once the Amendment Act, along with their Rules and Notification are implemented, the bovine sports wouldnot come within the mischief sought to be remedied by Sections 3,11(1) (a) and (m) of the 1960 Act.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 \u2013 Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 \u2013 The TamilNadu Amendment Act states that it is to preserve the cultural heritageof the State of Tamil Nadu \u2013 Can the impugned Tamil NaduAmendment Act be stated to be part of the cultural heritage of thepeople of the State of Tamil Nadu so as to receive the protection ofArticle 29 of the Constitution of India \u2013 Held: Jallikattu is a type ofbovine sports \u2013 It is going on in the State of Tamil Nadu for at leastlast few centuries \u2013 But whether this has become integral part ofTamil culture or not requires religious, cultural and social analysisin greater detail, which is an exercise that cannot be undertaken bythe Judiciary \u2013 The question as to whether the Tamil NaduAmendment Act is to preserve the cultural heritage of a particularState is a debateable issue which has to be concluded in the Houseof the People \u2013 This ought not be a part of judicial inquiry \u2013 Thisquestion cannot be conclusively determined in the writ proceedings\u2013 Since legislative exercise has already been undertaken andJallikattu has been found to be part of cultural heritage of TamilNadu, the Court would not disrupt this view of the legislature.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 \u2013 Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 \u2013 Is the TamilNadu Amendment Act, in pith and substance, to ensure the survivaland well-being of the native breed of bulls? Is the Act, in pith andsubstance, relatable to Article 48 of the Constitution of India \u2013 Held:The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act is not in pith and substance, toensure survival and well-being of the native breeds of bulls \u2013 Thesaid Act is also not relatable to Article 48 of the Constitution ofIndia \u2013 Incidental impact of the said Amendment Act may fall uponthe breed of a particular type of bulls and affect agriculturalactivities, but in pith and substance the Act is relatable to Entry 17of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 \u2013 Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 \u2013 Does theTamil Nadu Amendment Act go contrary to Articles 51A(g) and51A(h), and could it be said, therefore, to be unreasonable and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India \u2013 Held:The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act does not go contrary to the Articles51-A (g) and 51-A(h) and it does not violate the provisions of Articles14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 \u2013 Prevention ofCruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 \u2013 Is theimpugned Tamil Nadu Amendment Act directly contrary to thejudgment in A. Nagaraja, and the review judgment dated 16.11.2016in the aforesaid case, and whether the defects pointed out in theaforesaid two judgments could be said to have been overcome bythe Tamil Nadu Legislature by enacting the impugned Tamil NaduAmendment Act \u2013 Held: The Tamil Nadu Amendment Act read alongwith the Rules framed in that behalf is not directly contrary to theratio of the judgment in the case of A. Nagaraja and judgment ofthis Court delivered on 16.11.2016 dismissing the plea for Reviewof the A. Nagaraja judgment as the defects pointed out in theaforesaid two judgments have been overcome by the State AmendmentAct read with the Rules made in that behalf.Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 48 \u2013 Recognising rights of animals\u2013 By virtue of Article 48 of the Constitution of India which essentiallyoperates as a national guideline for law makers, a two-way pathhas been devised \u2013 The first is imposing duty on the State to organiseagriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines \u2013The second is emphasising the duty of the State to take steps forpreserving and improving the breeds and prohibiting slaughter ofcows and calves and other milch and draught cattle."

Joseph, J.): Bitumen may befound in small quantities or large quantities \u2013 If the \u2018article\u2019 is to befound \u2018valuable\u2019, then in small quantity it must not just have somevalue but it must be \u2018worth a good price\u2019 or \u2018worth a great deal ofmoney\u2019 and not that it has \u2018value\u2019 \u2013 s.69A would then stand attracted\u2013 \u2018Bitumen\u2019 as such cannot be treated as a \u2018valuable article\u2019 \u2013 Held(per Hrishikesh Roy, J.) (concurring): When the principle of EjusdemGeneris is applied, the preceding words in s.69A such as money,bullion, jewellery would suggest that the phrase \u2018other valuablearticle\u2019 which follows those words, would justify inclusion of onlyhigh value goods \u2013 Any other way of reading the phrase \u2018othervaluable article\u2019 or \u2018valuable article\u2019 by ignoring the kind of specificgoods mentioned in the preceding part of s.69A, would be incorrectand would do violence to the plain language of the provision andwill travel beyond the legislative intent \u2013 Additionally, the maxim\u2018noscitur a sociis\u2019 i.e. (a word is known by its associates) would alsosupport the above view that the other valuable articles should beitems in the nature of silver bars, or jewellery or money i.e. onlyhigh priced item \u2013 It is given, that no law could possibly provide foran exhaustive list of all valuable items that may facilitate high incomeassessees to adjust their income \u2013 Only an indicative list of valuable articles can practically be mentioned in the Section \u2013 But to includebitumen within the expression \u2018other valuable article\u2019 in s.69A, wouldresult in absurdities, that one needs to eschew \u2013 The common placeitems from kirana store and bitumen are intrinsically dissimilar tothe high value items in s.69A and through an interpretive exercise,one should not categorise them with items such as gold bars andjewellery.Income Tax Act, 1961\u2013 s.69A \u2013 Can a thief be the owner ofthe goods \u2013 Held (per K.M. Joseph, J.): The illegality of theownership may not ill square with the requirement of s.69A that theassessing officer must find the assessee to be the owner of the article\u2013 However, that is not to say that without finding ownership orwhen it is obvious that someone else is the owner, a person found inpossession, which is illegal, can be found to be the owner unders.69A \u2013 It would be straining the law beyond justification if theCourt were to recognise a thief as the owner of the property withinthe meaning of s.69A \u2013 Recognising a thief as the owner of theproperty would also mean that the owner of the property wouldcease to be recognised as the owner, which would indeed be themost startling result \u2013 While possession of a person may inappropriate cases, when there is no explanation forthcoming aboutthe source and quality of his possession, justify an assessing officerfinding him to be the owner, when the facts are known that thecarrier is not the owner and somebody else is the owner, then todescribe him as the owner may produce results which are most illegalapart from being unjust.Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 s.69A \u2013 Article and Valuable Article\u2013 Distinguished \u2013 Held (per Hrishikesh Roy, J.): Articles of valueare a genus of which valuable articles are a species i.e. a subset ofhigh priced items \u2013 An article having value may not be a valuablearticle \u2013 Categorising all sundry items as valuable articles will leadto an interpretation which will be foreign to the purpose of the lawand the intention of the legislature in so far as s.69A is concerned.Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Noscitur a Sociis and ejusdem generis \u2013Discussed.Maxims \u2013 Absoluta sententia expositore non indiget \u2013 Explained.

        "HeadNote": " Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s. 302 r/w. s.34 \u2013 Acquittal under \u2013 Prosecution case that \u2018S\u2019 was tenant of an apartment on the second floor of a building owned by PW-3 \u2013 On 12.09.2000, at about 10.40 a.m., an information was given to the police that a dead body is lying in that apartment \u2013 As per prosecution, two disclosure/ confessional statements were made by each of the two accused (\u2018S\u2019 and \u2018N\u2019) during police custody \u2013 Trial Court held that the proven circumstances constituted a chain which conclusively indicated that the accused \u2018S\u2019 in the company of co-accused \u2018N\u2019 committed the crime and to remove the evidence hid the dagger and the bloodstained clothes and further, to hoodwink the police, \u2018N\u2019 wrote and planted a suicide letter in a pocket of the trouser worn by the deceased \u2013 Both the accused were convicted u/ss. 302 r/w. s. 34 \u2013 High Court acquitted \u2018N\u2019, however, S\u2019s conviction was upheld \u2013 On appeal, held: Mere tenancy of the apartment being with \u2018S\u2019 by itself is not sufficient to hold him guilty as there is no general presumption against the owner/tenant of a property with regard to his/her guilt if a dead body with homicidal injuries is found in his/her property \u2013 Prosecution failed to lead any evidence that the two accused, or any one of them, were present there, or in the vicinity \u2013 There is no witness statement identifying the handwriting of accused \u2018N\u2019 or disclosing that accused wrote the suicide letter in his presence \u2013 There is also no evidence to explain the relevance of the contents of the suicide letter \u2013 Suicide letter indicts one person \u2018C\u2019\u2013 As to why such indictment was made; whether it was with reference to some other event contemplated, the prosecution evidence is silent \u2013 Barring the expert report, there exists no internal or external evidence to lend assurance to the prosecution story that the suicide letter was written by accused \u2018N\u2019 \u2013 As regards recovery of clothes at the instance of \u2018S\u2019, PW4, a witness to that recovery, has been declared hostile \u2013 There is thus no support to that recovery from any public witness \u2013 The circumstance that the clothes carried blood of same group as of the deceased is rendered meaningless because there is no admissible evidence to connect the clothes with the two accused \u2013 As regards recovery of knife at the instance of \u2018N\u2019, the same has been denied by \u2018N\u2019 and there appears no independent witness to support it \u2013 Its incriminating value is extremely limited because, firstly, there is no forensic evidence connecting the knife with the crime; secondly, the knife is a common knife which could easily be available; thirdly, the wounds found on the body of the deceased were of different dimensions giving rise to possibility of use of more weapon than one; and, fourthly, the entire exercise of recovery does not inspire confidence, particularly, because the first attempt to recover had failed \u2013 Thus, the prosecution failed to prove a chain of incriminating circumstances as to conclusively point out that in all human probability it was the two accused or any one of them, and no one else, who had committed the murder. Evidence \u2013 Circumstantial Evidence \u2013 Conviction on strength of evidence which are circumstantial in nature \u2013 Settled legal position \u2013 The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established \u2013 Also, circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused \u2013 Further, the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so far complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and the circumstances should be consistent only with the hypothesis regarding the guilt of the accused and they must exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved \u2013 The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established meaning thereby that they \u2018must\u2019 or \u2018should\u2019 and not \u2018may be\u2019 established as the Court must not be oblivious of the most fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence, which is, that the accused \u2018must be\u2019 and not merely \u2018may be\u2019 guilty before the Court proceeds to convict him. Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 106 \u2013 Burden of proof under it upon the accused \u2013 Legal position \u2013 It is settled that s. 106 of the Evidence Act does not absolve the prosecution of discharging its primary burden of proving the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 It is only when the prosecution has led evidence which, if believed, will sustain a conviction, or which makes out a prima facie case, that the question arises of considering facts of which the burden of proof would lie upon the accused. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 311-A \u2013 Law therein and its prospective application \u2013 By Act No.25 of 2005, with effect from 23.06.2006, Section 311-A has been inserted in the Code thereby empowering a Magistrate of the First Class to direct any person including an accused to give specimen signature or handwriting for the purposes of investigation but this provision would have no bearing on the case instant case as it is of the year 2000. Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 73 \u2013 Scope \u2013 The provisions of S. 73 apply when a proceeding such as an inquiry or trial is pending in a Court \u2013 In the instant case, since no proceedings were pending before any Court when the specimens in question were obtained, provisions of s.73 could not have been invoked. Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 45 \u2013 Handwriting Expert \u2013 Admissibility \u2013 Scope \u2013 It is not impermissible to base a finding with regard to authorship of a document solely on the opinion of a handwriting expert but, as a rule of prudence, because of imperfect nature of the science of identification of handwriting and its accepted fallibility, such opinion has to be relied with caution and may be accepted if, on its own assessment, the Court is satisfied that the internal and external evidence relating to the document in question supports the opinion of the expert and it is safe to accept his opinion.

of sexual harassment at work place\u2013 Defying the principles of natural justice \u2013 Appellant was appointedby the respondent no.2-Goa University \u2013 Appellant was accused ofsexual harassment by several girl students \u2013 Appellant was servedwith notice to explain charges levelled against him \u2013 Inquiryproceedings took place thereafter, in the month of May 2009, when12 hearings, most of them back to back, were conducted by theCommittee \u2013 Appellant was unable to appear due to health reasons,however, he had sought extension of time, which was denied \u2013Proceedings proceeded ex-parte and submitted its report establishingsexual harassment by the appellant \u2013 Committee recommended histermination from service \u2013 The Executive Council (EC) acceptedthe report submitted by the Committee and the appellant was placedunder suspension with immediate effect \u2013 EC proposed to conductan inquiry against him under Rule 14 of CCS (CCA) Rules \u2013 However,appellant was informed that in the light of an order passed by theSupreme Court in Medha Kotwal\u2019s case, the report of the ComplaintsCommittee for Prevention of Sexual Harassment of Women atWorkplace shall be deemed to be an Inquiry Report under the CCS(CCA) Rules which shall be binding on the disciplinary authorityfor initiating disciplinary action against the government servant \u2013Disciplinary Authority dismissed the appellant from service \u2013Appellant filed writ petition before the High Court, which wasdismissed \u2013 On appeal, held: It is an admitted position that theinquiry proceedings were aborted at the initial stage itself and itwas the Report of the Committee submitted earlier, that was actedupon by the EC \u2013 The Committee itself was unclear as to the scopeof its inquiry, the appellant cannot be blamed for harbouring animpression that the remit of the Committee was confined to fact finding alone and i t was not discharging the funct ions of adisciplinary committee, as contemplated under the service Rules \u2013It is also noteworthy that the time span prescribed under the CCS(CCA) Rules for concluding an inquiry is ordinarily within a periodof six months from the date of receipt of the order of appointment \u2013In the instant case, the entire process was wrapped up in flat 39days \u2013 This shows the tearing hurry in which the Committee was tosubmit its Report \u2013 The undue haste demonstrated by the Committeefor bringing the inquiry to a closure, cannot justify curtailment ofthe right of the appellant to a fair hearing \u2013 When the legitimacy ofthe decision taken is dependent on the fairness of the process andthe process adopted itself became questionable, then the decisionarrived at cannot withstand judicial scrutiny and is wide open tointerference \u2013 The discretion vested in the Committee for conductingthe inquiry has been exercised improperly, defying the principles ofnatural justice \u2013 As a consequence thereof, the impugned judgmentupholding the decision taken by the EC of terminating the servicesof the appellant, duly endorsed by the Appellate Authority cannotbe sustained.Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 309 \u2013 Conditions of service \u2013Scope \u2013 Art. 309 does not by itself provide for recruitment orconditions of service of Government servants, but confers this poweron the appropriate legislature to make the laws and on the Presidentand the Government of a State to make rules relating to these matters\u2013 However, any Act or Rule that violates the rights guaranteed to agovernment servant under Article 311, would be void \u2013 Similarly,such an Act or Rule would be treated as void if it violates any of thefundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 310 \u2013 Doctrine of Pleasure \u2013Article 310 embodies the \u201cDoctrine of Pleasure\u201d and in the contextof Government servants, relates to their tenure of service \u2013 Theorigin of Government servants may be contractual, once appointedto the post or office, they acquire a status and their rights andobligations are no longer determined by the consent of both theparties, but are governed by the Statute or Statutory Rules.Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 311 \u2013 Manifestation of thePrinciple of Natural Justice \u2013 To provide a sense of security oftenure to Government servants, the framers of the Constitution have incorporated safeguards in respect of the punishment or dismissalor removal or reduction in their rank as provided for in Clauses (1)and (2) of Article 311 \u2013 At the same time, being mindful of the verysame public interest and public good which does not permit thatGovernment servants found to be corrupt, dishonest or inefficientbe continued in service, a remedy is provided under the secondproviso to Clause (2) of Article 311 whereunder their services canbe dispensed with, without conducting a disciplinary inquiry.Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14 \u2013 A Bedrock of Principles ofNatural Justice \u2013 Principles of natural justice that are reflected inArticle 311, are not an empty incantation \u2013 They form the verybedrock of Article 14 and any violation of these principlestantamounts to a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution \u2013 Denialof the principles of natural justice to a public servant can invalidatea decision taken on the ground that it is hit by the vice of arbitrarinessand would result in depriving a public servant of equal protectionof law.Principles/Doctrines \u2013 Principle of Natural Justice \u2013 Twinanchors : Nemo Judex In Causa Sua and Audi Alteram Partem \u2013 Thetwin anchors on which the principles of natural justice rest in thejudicial process, whether quasi-judicial or administrative in nature,are Nemo Judex In Causa Sua, i.e., no person shall be a judge in hisown cause as justice should not only be done, but should manifestlybe seen to be done and Audi Alteram Partem, i.e. a person affectedby a judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative action must beafforded an opportunity of hearing before any decision is taken.Administration of Justice \u2013 Fair action and impartiality inservice jurisprudence \u2013 Courts interpret statutory provisions in syncwith the aforesaid principles of natural justice on a premise that nostatutory authority would violate the fundamental rights enshrinedin the Constitution \u2013 Further when it comes to authorities that areexpected to discharge judicial and quasi-judicial functions, the ruleof audi alteram partem applies with equal force \u2013 Reasonablenessinfuses lifeblood in procedural matters, be it elements of the notice,the contents of the notice, the scope of inquiry, the material availableor an adequate opportunity to rebut such material and all of this isto avoid miscarriage of justice at any stage. Central Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)Rules, 1965 \u2013 r. 14 \u2013 Expression \u201cas far as is practicable\u201d \u2013 Theuse of the expression \u201cas far as is practicable\u201d indicates a play inthe joints available to the Complaints Committee to adopt a fairprocedure that is feasible and elastic for conducting an inquiry ina sensitive matter like sexual harassment at the workplace, withoutcompromising on the principles of natural justice.Administration of Justice \u2013 Reasonableness into theprocedural regime in Service Matter \u2013 The cardinal principlerequired to be borne in mind is that the person accused of misconductmust be informed of the case, must be supplied the evidence insupport thereof and be given a reasonable opportunity to presenthis version before any adverse decision is taken \u2013 Similarly, theconcerned employer is also expected to act fairly and adopt aprocedure that is just, fair and reasonable \u2013 The whole purpose isto breathe reasonableness into the procedural regime but, the testof reasonableness cannot be abstract \u2013 It has to be pragmatic andgrounded in the realities of the facts and circumstances of a case.Sexual Harassment of Women at Work Place (Prevention,Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 \u2013 To fulfil the promise that thePoSH Act holds out to working women all over the country \u2013Appropriate directions issued."

Mohan Rao, the Supreme Court observed that the contention,based on comparative analysis of the State Acts and the new LAAct, to establish violation of the equality clause u/Art. 14 of theConstitution, is left open \u2013 Parties were given liberty to raise allother issues not dealt with in that judgment \u2013 In C.A.Nos. 5692-5693 of 2021, it is contended that the High Court erred in holdingthat the Industrial Purposes Act was not liable to be invalidated onthe grounds of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of theConstitution \u2013 The question arose was as to the locus standi of theappellants, who admittedly purchased their lands after the initiationof land acquisition proceedings, to maintain a challenge to theprovisions of the Act of 1997 and the proceedings ini tiatedthereunder \u2013 Whereas in C.A.No. 5697 of 2021, appellants haveassailed the common order dated 03.07.2019 passed by the HighCourt, whereby challenge to the validity of the Highways Act, onthe grounds of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 of theConstitution, was rejected \u2013 The grievance of these two persons iswith regard to the acquisition of their lands by the State of TamilNadu under the Highways Act \u2013 It is contended that the HighwayAct, 2001 is liable liable to be invalidated on the ground that itsprovisions manifest discrimination or arbitrariness when comparedwith the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation andTransparency in Land Acquisition; Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 \u2013 Held: In C.A.Nos, 5692-5693 of 2021, they weresubsequent purchasers and deemed to aware of the acquisitionproceedings \u2013 In any event, neither of these subsequent purchaserscan be permitted to claim ignorance of the acquisition proceedings\u2013 Mere passage of time and publication of the s.3(1) Notice aftertheir purchase of the lands would not save their sale transactionsor vest them with a right to attack the acquisition \u2013 In consequence,no reason to entertain their challenge to the Industrial PurposesAct on the grounds of arbitrariness and violation of Article 14 ofthe Constitution or their consequential challenge to the acquisitionproceedings \u2013 As far as C.A.No. 5697 of 2021 is concerned, theHighways Act in the State of Tamil Nadu stood protected even at thetime the old LA Act was in force and effect, owing to the Presidentialassent that it had received u/Art. 254(2) of the Constitution, and itcontinued to operate and provide altogether different yardsticksfor acquisition of land and payment of compensation till the adventof the new LA Act \u2013 No doubt, the scheme of the new LA Act advocatestimely measures being adopted in implementation of the acquisitionand such general temporal restrictions would benefit the landowners, but the absence of such restrictions in the Highways Actmay not be reason enough to invalidate it, as the very premise onwhich the Highways Acts was enacted by the State of Tamil Naduwas to cut down on time-consuming processes."

Act, 1956 over the property in question, the bidder/purchaser was entitled to proceed on the assumption that even if there were any arrears of such taxes under the M.P. Act, 1956, the same would not be recoverable from him \u2013 Company Court and the High Court rightly held that the liability on account of the property tax and water tax claimed by the respondent No. 1 to the extent rejected by the appellant-OL was a post-liquidation liability, which the OL was obliged to discharge, in view of the omission in the sale notice and then, in view of the operation of r.338, 1959 Rules \u2013 In absence of any statutory provision, the auction purchaser without notice of any charge could not be made liable for the arrears of tax in question during the post-liquidation period \u2013 Arrears of property tax and water tax until the date of confirmation of sale would qualify as the expenses for \u201cpreserving, realising or getting in\u201d the assets of the company and thus, shall have to be paid in priority by the appellant- OL \u2013 View taken by the High Court calls for no interference \u2013 Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 ss. 529A, 530.
