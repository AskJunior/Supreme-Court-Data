Constitution of India \u2013 Article 243-ZA(1), 324(1) \u2013 Held: The language and tenor of Article 243-ZA(1) is in pari materia with Article 324(1) \u2013 Interpretation of Article 324(1) to confer wide powers on the Election Commission to issue directions in respect of elections to Parliament and State legislatures would apply to Article 243- ZA(1) which has to be construed to confer powers on the State Election Commission to issue directions related to superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral roles or for conduct of elections to municipalities \u2013 State Election Commission has the same powers u/Article 243-K and 243-ZA(1) as the Election Commission has u/Article 324(1). Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 \u2013 Karnataka Municipal Corporation (Election) Rules, 1979 \u2013 Representation of People Act, 1951 \u2013 Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 \u2013 Held: A hypertechnical view of the omission to incorporate any specific provision in the KMC Election Rules, similar to the 1961 Rules, expressly requiring disclosure of assets, to condone dishonesty and corrupt practice would be against the spirit of the Constitution and public interest. Precedent \u2013 Held: A judgment is a precedent for the issue of law raised and decided \u2013 Judgment has to be construed in the backdrop of the facts and circumstances in which it has been rendered."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Difference between s.7(5)(a) and s.9(5)(a) \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Legislature used \u2018may\u2019 in s.7(5)(a) of the IBC but a different word \u2018shall\u2019 in the otherwise almost identical provision of s.9(5)(a) shows that \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018shall\u2019 in the two provisions are intended to convey a different meaning \u2013 Legislature intended s.9(5)(a) of the IBC to be mandatory and s.7(5)(a) of the IBC to be discretionary \u2013 An application of an Operational Creditor for initiation of CIRP u/s.9(2) of the IBC is mandatorily required to be admitted if the application is complete in all respects and in compliance of the requisites of the IBC. Words and Phrases: May and Shall \u2013 Presumption of Fact and Presumption of Law \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Ordinarily the word \u201cmay\u201d is directory \u2013 The expression \u2018may admit\u2019 confers discretion to admit \u2013 The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d postulates a mandatory requirement \u2013 The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d raises a presumption that a provision is imperative \u2013 The prima facie presumption about the provision being imperative may be rebutted by other considerations such as the scope of the enactment and the consequences flowing from the construction. Interpretation of Statutes: Rules of interpretation \u2013 First and foremost principle of interpretation of a statute is the rule of literal interpretation \u2013 Purposive interpretation can only be resorted to when the plain words of a statute are ambiguous or if construed literally, the provision would nullify the object of the statute or otherwise lead to an absurd result. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Difference between Financial Creditors and Operational Creditors \u2013 Discussed."

Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988 \u2013 ss.2(a), 3 \u2013 Mens rea, absence of \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: The criminal provision envisaged u/ss. 2(a) and 3 does not expressly contemplate mens rea \u2013 Mens rea is an essential ingredient of a criminal offence \u2013 Absence of mens rea creates a harsh provision having strict liability \u2013Mere fact that the object of the statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate a grave social evil which by itself is not decisive of the question as to whether the element of a guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of an offence \u2013 Mens rea by necessary implication may be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that implementation of the object of the statute would otherwise be defeated \u2013 The language of s.2(a) coupled with s.3, completely ignores the aspect of mens rea, as it intends to criminalize the very act of one person paying consideration for acquisition of property for another person \u2013 The 1988 law was envisaged on the touchstone of strict liability. Judicial Review\u2013 Law with respect to testing the unconstitutionality of a statutory instrument \u2013 Held: Constitutional Courts can test constitutionality of legislative instruments (statute and delegated legislations)both on procedure as well as substantive nature of these instruments \u2013 The test should be based on a combined reading of Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Articles 14, 19, 21. Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Doctrine of manifest arbitrariness\u2013 Discussed. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Law declared unconstitutional \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: Such a declaration would render the law not to exist in the law books since its inception \u2013 It is only a limited exception under Constitutional law, or when substantial actions have been undertaken under such unconstitutional laws that going back to the original position would be next to impossible \u2013 In those cases alone, would this Court take recourse to the concept of \u2018prospective overruling\u2019. Constitution of India \u2013Retroactive/retrospective legislations \u2013 Legislature\u2019s power to enact \u2013 Held: Legislature has power to enact retroactive/retrospective civil legislations under the Constitution \u2013 However, Article 20(1) mandates that no law mandating a punitive provision can be enacted retrospectively \u2013 A punitive provision cannot be couched as a civil provision to by-pass the mandate under Article 20(1) of the Constitution which follows the settled legal principle that \u201cwhat cannot be done directly, cannot be done indirectly\u201d. Words and Phrases\u2013 \u201cForfeiture\u201d, \u201cBenami\u201d, \u201cBenami transaction\u201d, \u201cBenamidar/ostensible owner\u201d\u2013 Discussed."

Nagarathna, J.) (Concurring) : As per s. 101, the burden of proving a fact always lies upon the party who substantially asserts the affirmative and until such burden is discharged, the other party is not required to be called upon to prove his case \u2013 Burden to prove documents lie on plaintiff alone as onus is always on the person asserting a proposition or a fact \u2013 Once the plaintiff discharges the initial burden of prove and makes out a case which entitles him to relief, in terms of s. 102, the onus shifts to the defendants to prove those circumstances which would disentitle the plaintiff of the relief \u2013 However once the evidence has been led by the contesting parties, abstract considerations of onus are out of place and truth or otherwise must always be adjudged on the basis of evidence led by the parties \u2013 s. 106 is an exception to the general rule and it stipulates that when a fact to be proved is peculiarly within the knowledge of a party, it is for him to prove it \u2013 In an election petition, the initial burden to prove determination of age of returned candidate lies on the petitioner, however, burden lies on the respondent to prove facts within his special knowledge \u2013 In the present case, despite the voluminous oral and documentary evidence, the appellant has been unable to prove the fact that he was born on 30.09.1990 \u2013 Consequently, he was not 25 years old at the time of filing the nomination \u2013 Election of the appellant to state legislative assembly set aside \u2013 Evidence Act, 1972 \u2013 ss. 101 to 106, 35 and 21 \u2013 Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 \u2013 s.13(3) \u2013 U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 \u2013 r.9 \u2013 Representation of People\u2019s Act, 1951 \u2013 ss. 15 and 116 A. Evidence Act, 1972 \u2013 Passports and Visas \u2013 Evidentiary value of admitted documents \u2013 Whether the information entered in the passport application would amount to proof as to contents of such application, including the date and place of birth entered therein \u2013 Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Great evidentiary value has to be attached to an application submitted to a government establishment or Office, such as a Passport Office and the details entered in such application, together with the documents submitted therewith, must be understood to be tendered by the applicant who signs the application form thereby accepting that the information submitted therein is true and correct and to the best of his knowledge \u2013 In the present case, appellant having admitted the fact that his date of birth was 01.01.1993 and place of birth was Rampur, in the application form dated 06.07.2012, it was not open for appellant to subsequently resile from the aforesaid clear admission and contend that he was unaware that an \u2018incorrect\u2019 date of birth was recorded in certain documents \u2013 Documentary evidence produced by respondent election petitioner has cogent and probative value \u2013 This is because the said documents are consistent with the admitted documents of appellant as well as with the admissions made by the appellant himself. Evidence \u2013 Public documents \u2013 Probative value of documents made, without following statutory procedure \u2013 Whether the Birth Certificate issued on 21.01.2015 by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, was a valid piece of evidence \u2013 Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam Lucknow was without following the mandatory provisions of s.13 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1969 \u2013 s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act and r. 9 of the U.P Registration of Birth and Death Rules, 2002 provides that any birth or death which had not been registered within one year of its occurrence, shall be registered only on an order made by a Magistrate of First Class or Presidency Magistrate after verifying the correctness of birth and death \u2013 In the present case, Nagar Nigam, Lucknow, had no jurisdiction to register the birth of the appellant after twenty five years from the date on which he was stated to be born by the issuance of the Birth Certificate on 21.01.2015 without an order of the Sub Divisional Magistrate as required u/s. 13(3) of the 1969 Act, r/w r. 9(3), 2002 Rules \u2013 Moreover, perusal of hospital records such as the Emergency O.T. (E.O.T) register and the Maternity Labour room Register (MLR), shows that same are mired with discrepancies, overwriting and factual inaccuracies which cannot be ignored \u2013 Therefore, no weight can be placed on birth certificate issued by the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow on 21.01.2015 which is stated to be issued on strength of an entry made in birth register maintained by hospital \u2013 Registration of Birth and Death Act, 1969 \u2013 s.13(3) \u2013 U.P. Registration of the Birth and Death Rules, 2002 \u2013 r.9. Evidence \u2013 Medical Evidence \u2013 Evidentiary value of bone ossification test for determining age \u2013 Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Ossification test cannot be solely relied upon as conclusive proof of age \u2013 The general rule for determining the age is that it can vary plus or minus two years and that the date of birth of a person is to be determined on the basis of the material on record and on appreciation of evidence adduced by parties \u2013 Report of an ossification test can, at most, be used to corroborate other relevant evidences, oral or documentary. Evidence \u2013 Documents of identity \u2013 Relevance of Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License as regards proof of date of birth \u2013 Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Aadhar card is a means of identity and not a proof of date of birth \u2013 On facts, the Aadhar Card, Voter I.D. Card and Driving License did not conclusively establish that the appellant was above twenty five years of age on the date of filing his nomination papers or on the date of declaration of result of the legislative assembly election in question. Words and Phrases \u2013 Difference between \u201cburden of proof\u201d and \u201conus of proof\u201d \u2013 Explained."

Wakf Act, 1995 \u2013 Wakf \u2013 Constituent elements of \u2013 Held: The first indispensable requirement is that there must be dedication \u2013 Dedication must be by a person who is the owner of the property \u2013 Dedication must be permanent \u2013 Permanent means that it cannot be for a period of time; it must be perpetual \u2013 A Wakf can be created by a Will also \u2013 When a Wakf is created by a Will it is open to the Wakif to revoke the will prior to his death \u2013 Save as aforesaid, a Wakf cannot be revoked \u2013 A Wakf, again meaning the property which is the subject matter of a Wakf cannot be alienated \u2013 The object of the Wakf must be such that it is approved by the Muslim law \u2013 The object must be religious, pious or charitable \u2013 It is not a concept of piety religiousness or the charitable nature in the eyes of the entire world but what is in consonance with Muslim law \u2013 There is no prescribed mode of dedication \u2013 A Wakf need not be in writing \u2013 As far as declaration is concerned, it can be inferred from conduct \u2013 A Wakf, as defined includes Wakf by user \u2013 A Wakf can be created for attaining a public utility \u2013 The public utility must, however, be for an object sanctioned by Muslim law \u2013 Subject to said conditions, irrespective of whether the beneficiaries are Muslims or not, there could be a valid Wakf . Wakf Act, 1995 \u2013 s.4 \u2013 Survey under the Act \u2013 Held: The making of survey is not a mere administrative act but it is to be informed by a quasi-judicial inquiry \u2013 Also, the surveyor has the power to find whether a particular institution is a Wakf. Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art. 226 \u2013 Power under \u2013 Exercise of \u2013 Effect of alternate remedy \u2013 Held: Article 226 confers a jurisdiction or a power on the High Courts \u2013 It is a power under the Constitution \u2013 While a statute may provide for an alternate forum to which the High Court may relegate the party in an appropriate case, the existence of an alternate remedy by itself cannot exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court under the Constitution."

Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 21 \u2013 Preservation of family Life \u2013 Held: State while formulating a policy for its own employees has to give due consideration to the importance of protecting family life as an element of the dignity of the person and a postulate of privacy because preservation of family life is an incident of Art.21 \u2013 Service Law. Constitution of India \u2013 Articles 14, 15 and 16 \u2013 Substantive equality of opportunity\u2013 Held: It becomes necessary for the Government to adopt policies through which it produces substantive equality of opportunity as distinct from a formal equality for women in the workplace \u2013 The true aim of achieving substantive equality must be fulfilled by the State in recognizing the persistent patterns of discrimination against women once they are in the work place \u2013 Therefore, the State, both in its role as a model employer as well as an institution which is subject to constitutional norms, must bear in mind the fundamental right to substantive equality when it crafts the policy even for its own employees \u2013 Service Law. Service Law \u2013 Transfer Policy \u2013 Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 \u2013 Held: It is a statutory mandate for recognizing the principle of reasonable accommodation for the disabled members of society \u2013 The formulation of a policy therefore, must take into account the mandate which Parliament imposes as an intrinsic element of the right of the disabled to live with dignity. Constitution of India \u2013 Judicial review \u2013 Policy Making \u2013 Held: Court in the exercise of judicial review cannot direct the executive to frame a particular policy - Yet, the legitimacy of a policy can be assessed on the touchstone of constitutional parameters \u2013 Service Law."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Swiss Challenge Process \u2013 Held: An Anchor Bidder has no vested right beyond the Right of First Refusal (ROFR), being the origination of the proposal \u2013 The Swiss Challenge Process is just another method of private participation recognized for its transparency \u2013 Ultimately, the IBC has left it to the discretion of the Liquidator to explore the best possible method for selling the assets of the Corporate Debtor in liquidation, which includes Private Sale through direct negotiations with the object of maximizing the value of the assets offered for sale. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Jurisdiction of the NCLT and the NCLAT \u2013 Held: Powers vested in and the duties cast upon the Liquidator have been made subject to the directions of the Adjudication Authority (NCLT) u/s.35 \u2013 Once the Liquidator applies to the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) for appropriate orders/ directions, including the decision to sell the movable and immovable assets of the Corporate Debtor in liquidation by adopting a particular mode of sale and the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) grants approval to such a decision, there is no provision in the IBC that empowers the Appellate Authority (NCLAT) to suo motu conduct a judicial review of the said decision \u2013 The jurisdiction bestowed upon the Adjudicating Authority [NCLT] and the Appellate Authority [NCLAT] are circumscribed by the provisions of the IBC, they cannot act as a Court of equity or exercise plenary powers to unilaterally reverse the decision of the Liquidator based on commercial wisdom and supported by the stakeholders. Constitution of India \u2013 Judicial Review \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Commercial Matters \u2013 Held: It is a well-settled principle that in matters relating to commercial transactions, tenders, etc., the scope of judicial review is fairly limited and the court ought to refrain from substituting its decisions for that of the tendering agency."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Object of \u2013 Discussed. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.29A \u2013 Objective of \u2013 Discussed. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.29A(h) (as amended by the Act 26 of 2018) \u2013 Date of reckoning \u2013 Whether the date of submission of resolution plan or the date of adjudication by the authority \u2013 Held: If there is a bar at the time of submission of resolution plan by a resolution applicant, it is obviously not maintainable \u2013 However, if the submission of the plan is maintainable at the time at which it is filed, and thereafter, by the operation of the law, a person becomes ineligible, which continues either till the time of approval by the CoC, or adjudication by the authority, then the subsequent amended provision would govern the question of eligibility of resolution applicant to submit a resolution plan \u2013 If there is ineligibility which in turn prohibits the other stakeholders to proceed further and the amendment being in the nature of providing a better process, and that too in the interest of the creditors and the debtor, the same is required to be followed as against the provision that stood at an earlier point of time \u2013 Thus, a mere filing of the submission of a resolution plan has got no rationale, as it does not create any right in favour of a facilitator nor it can be extinguished \u2013 It cannot be said that what is good today cannot be applied merely because an applicant was eligible to submit a resolution plan at an earlier point of time\u2013 It is only a part of procedural law. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.12(3) \u2013 Held: There is a marked difference between extension and exclusion \u2013 Exclusion would come into play when the decision is challenged before a higher forum \u2013 Extension is one which is to be exercised by the authority constituted."

        "HeadNote": " Constitution of India \u2013 Judicial Review \u2013 Foreign funded project \u2013 Bullet Train Project \u2013 Interference by High Court in Tender Process \u2013 When not justified \u2013 Appellant, a government company issued a tender notice calling for bids for works in relation to the project of construction of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (Project) \u2013 Bids submitted by the respondent along with four other bidders were declared unsuccessful at Technical Stage \u2013 High Court allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent and quashed the communications dated 27.04.2021 and 28.04.2021 and the notification dated 28.04.2021 by which the technical Bid submitted by the respondents was rejected on the ground that the same is nonresponsive \u2013 Whether w.r.t such a foreign funded project, the High Court was justified in interfering with the tender process in absence of any specific allegations of mala fides and/or favouritism \u2013 Held: High Court ought to have appreciated that the Bullet Train Project is a result of long-drawn deliberations between the Government of India and the Government of Japan \u2013 A loan agreement came to be executed between the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Hon\u2019ble the President of India \u2013 JICA agreed to fund approximately Rs.1 lakh crores for the project on the terms and conditions mentioned in the loan agreement and the other agreed terms including the terms and conditions of the Bid document finalized by the JICA/JICC (Japan International Consultants Consortium) \u2013 The Bidding Documents are based on JICA\u2019s Standard Bidding Documents as well as based on its procurement guidelines, which form an integral part of the loan agreement \u2013 Therefore, any decision contrary to the terms and conditions of the Bidding Document would be altering the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, which would not be permissible \u2013 JICA has a vital role to play in such contracts \u2013 The foreign funded investment such as the present investment in the form of concessional Official Development Assistance (ODA) loan by the JICA are made on the basis of non- negotiated terms and conditions where the sole discretion as to what will be the conditions of investment and on what terms the contractors would be chosen to implement the project vests with the investor- foreign developed nation \u2013 The ultimate decision vests on the concerned parties, who financed/invested in the project, i.e., in the present case JICA \u2013 The decision to hold that the Bid was not responsive was of JICC \u2013 Under the contractual mechanism,the appellant had no authority to deviate from the evaluation done by JICC \u2013 Appellant acted as per the decision of the JICC concurred by JICA \u2013 The JICC and JICA can be said to be the final authority and no contrary decision to the decision of the JICC/JICA could have been taken by the appellant, more particularly, with respect to the Bidding Process etc. \u2013 Further, the bidding procedure adopted was transparent, fair and does not suffer from any arbitrariness \u2013 As such there were no allegations of mala fides and/or favouritism either against the appellant or against JICC and/or JICA \u2013 High Court erred in interfering with the conscious decision taken by the JICA/JICC, followed by the appellant \u2013 It erred in holding that the Bid submitted by the respondent was in substantial compliance and in interfering with the tender process and with the decision of the JICC/JICA rejecting the Bid submitted by the original writ petitioner at technical stage \u2013 Impugned judgment passed by the High Court is quashed and set aside \u2013 Contracts. Contracts \u2013 Foreign Funded Contracts \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Judicial Review \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: Scope of judicial review in foreign funded contract should be far much less than the ordinary Government funded contracts funded from Consolidated Fund of India \u2013 The scope of judicial review in such foreign funded contracts/projects would be restricted and minimal \u2013 In such foreign funded contracts, the only ground for judicial review ought to be on a limited aspect, i.e., the action of the executing authority does not suffer from favouritism or nepotism and based on the grounds which have been concealed from the foreign financing authority, if disclosed, would have persuaded the financing authority to cancel the contract.

        "HeadNote": "Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 \u2013 s.18, Explanation to s.19, s.25(3) r/w s.17(1) and proviso to s.27(2) \u2013 Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) \u2013 The Act came into force with effect from 01.06.1999 \u2013 Under s.27 of the Act, unless there was a \u2018concluded contract\u2019 as on 01.06.1999, the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission was to regulate the tariff \u2013 Whether before the Act came into force, there was a concluded contract between the parties, and therefore such a contract could not be unsettled by the regulatory regime under the Act \u2013 Held: The parties contemplated a written Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) containing various details apart from the tariff rate and the tenure \u2013 The parties were not ad idem as regards the issues which were expressly left open for negotiations \u2013 The State Government (GoK) also contemplated \u2018finalising\u2019 a PPA \u2013 The word \u2018finalising\u2019 and the word \u2018PPA\u2019, both of which did not take place before 01.06.1999 resulted in a situation where a contract could not be said to be concluded even within the meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) of the Act \u2013 This is not even a case where parties were ad idem on all the essential aspects, which go into the formation of a complex contract as involved in the facts of this case \u2013 On facts, there was no concluded contract and what is more, a PPA was not a mere desire but an indispensable requirement to conclude the terms \u2013 It is clear as day light that all through the parties undoubtedly contemplated entering into a power purchase agreement \u2013 From the subject matter of the contract, the position of the parties, the implications of the working of the contract and more importantly, the intention of the parties, it was clear that there was a concluded contract upon negotiations and correspondence, culminating in the Government Order 12.05.1999 \u2013 Even the GO dated 12.05.1999 expressly contemplated only a permission by the GoK to the KEB to finalise \u201ca PPA\u201d for the purchase of surplus power \u2013 The word \u201cfinalise\u201d in the context of the PPA cannot be played down in the context of the previous correspondence at any rate \u2013 It was, in fact, also contemplated that the PPA which was to be finalised must after finalisation be submitted again to the government \u2013 GoK was thereafter to grant its approval \u2013 This cannot be overlooked. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s.10 \u2013 It is not essential to form a contract, that it should be in writing \u2013 Where a law stipulates that a contract be in writing in which case a contract must be reduced to writing. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.2 and 10 \u2013 Concluded contract \u2013 Held: In order that there must be a contract concluded, there must be a proposal made, which must be accepted \u2013 There must be consideration for the promise \u2013 The proposal must be accepted, which must be communicated \u2013 The acceptance must be unqualified \u2013 The parties can be said to have entered into a contract or a contract would be said to be concluded only when they are ad idem on all the essential terms of the contract \u2013 If the proposals containing the essential terms have been accepted, and the acceptance is communicated and, if the other conditions in s.2 are complied with, viz., that is there is consideration and the contract is enforceable in law, within the meaning of s.10, it would lead to the creation of a concluded contract. Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 \u2013 proviso to s.27(2) \u2013 Concluded contract within meaning of the proviso to s.27(2) \u2013 Held: The proviso to s.27(2) when it uses the words \u2018contracts concluded\u2019, does not use the words \u2018contracts concluded as regards tariffs\u2019 \u2013 There are various other aspects about which the parties must be ad idem \u2013 The rate, the term and quantum are integrally interconnected with other terms \u2013 There cannot be concluded contract without parties being ad idem about those terms. Karnataka Electricity Reforms Act, 1999 \u2013 s.41 \u2013 Appeals against order of the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission \u2013 Any person aggrieved by any decision or order of the Commission can file appeal to the High Court, on questions of law arising out of such order \u2013 Held: A Right of Appeal is a creature of a Statute \u2013 .The right can be qualified or conditioned \u2013 The ambit of the appellate power is to be discerned from the terms of the Statute \u2013 A \u2018question of law\u2019 is not the same as a \u2018substantial question of law\u2019 \u2013 However, when the Statute insists on a \u2018question of law\u2019 to maintain an appeal, the Appellate Body stands constrained to that extent \u2013 Appeal. Electricity Laws \u2013 Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission \u2013 The Commission is an Expert Body \u2013 Interference with its findings cannot be sustained, to begin with, if it is bereft of reasons \u2013 Findings of such a body must receive due deference \u2013 Perversity in the sense of findings, which are wholly without basis or material or which no person with the professed skills would arrive at, may merit interference \u2013 A finding, which ill squares with a clear statutory injunction, would leave the door ajar for overturning the finding."

Constitution of India: Legislative competence \u2013 Whether the Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (Management) Act, 2014 falls within the legislative competence of the Haryana State Legislature or it falls in Entry 44 of List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution \u2013 Held: There is no provision in the Punjab Reorganization Act, 1966 which confers legislative power upon the Parliament in respect of the subjects over which the State has legislative competence in terms of List II \u2013 Therefore, the transitional provisions i.e., the 1966 Act or the Inter-State Corporation Act 1957 do not impinge upon the legislative competence of the State legislature to enact a law on the subjects mentioned in the List II \u2013 Entry 32 deals with unincorporated trading, literary, scientific, religious and other societies and associations \u2013 In respect of such matters, the competent legislature is the State \u2013 In terms of Entry 44 of List I, the Parliament will have jurisdiction only if the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) under the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 continues to be an inter-State entity \u2013 The jurisdiction of the successor States either to repeal, modify or enact a new law has not been restricted by the 1966 Act \u2013 The SGPC became inter-State body corporate not because of Entry 44 List I but because of reorganisation of the territories of the erstwhile State of Punjab \u2013 Therefore, Entry 44 would have no applicability in respect of legislative competence of the State of Haryana to enact the 2014 Act \u2013 Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925 \u2013 Religious institutions \u2013 Gurdwara. Constitution of India: Art. 254(2) \u2013 Presidential assent \u2013 Whether required for Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (Management) Act, 2014 \u2013 Held: For entries in concurrent list, assent of the President would be necessary if there is an existing statute and the State law is contrary to some of the provisions of the Central law \u2013 Though the Haryana Committee constituted under the 2014 Act is in respect of religious purposes, but the prime intention is of an incorporation of juristic entity to manage the affairs of the Sikhs in the State \u2013 Incorporation of such juristic entity more appropriately falls within the domain of Entry 32 of List II and not within Entry 28 of List III of Seventh Schedule \u2013 Assent of the President is not required for the validity of 2014 Act. Constitution of India: Arts. 25 and 26 \u2013 Right to freedom of religion \u2013 Whether Haryana Sikh Gurdwara (Management) Act, 2014 violates fundamental rights of the petitioners under Arts. 25 and 26 of the Constitution so as to entitle the petitioners to invoke the jurisdiction under Art.32 of the Constitution \u2013 Held: 2014 Act is similar to the 1925 Act, inter alia having similar provisions of constituting a committee to manage the affairs under the Act \u2013 The affairs of the religious minority in the State i.e., Sikhs is left in the hands of the Sikhs alone in the same manner as was under the 1925 Act \u2013 Since, the affairs of the Sikh minority in the State are to be managed by the Sikhs alone, therefore, it cannot be said to be violative of any of the fundamental rights conferred under Arts. 25 and 26 of the Constitution \u2013 Writ petition is maintainable on the ground that the said writ petitions have been pending before this Court for almost 8 years wherein an interim order has been in operation throughout \u2013 Additionally, the questions, being purely legal, have been examined to give finality to the issues arising in the two matters."
