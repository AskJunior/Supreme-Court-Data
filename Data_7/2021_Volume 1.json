Judicial Review: Scope of \u2013 Held: Power of judicial review of the Constitutional Courts, is an evaluation of the decision-making process and not the merits of the decision itself \u2013 It is to ensure fairness in treatment and not to ensure fairness of conclusionConstitution of India: Arts.226, 136 \u2013 Power of judicial review in the matters of disciplinary inquiries \u2013 Constitutional Court while exercising its jurisdiction of judicial review under Art.226 or Art.136 of the Constitution would not interfere with the findings of fact arrived at in the departmental inquiry proceedings except in a case of malafides or perversity, i.e., where there is no evidence to support a finding or where a finding is such that no man acting reasonably and with objectivity could have arrived at that findings and so long as there is some evidence to support the conclusion arrived at by the departmental authority, the same has to be sustained. Service Law: Departmental enquiry \u2013 It is true that strict rules of evidence are not applicable to departmental enquiry proceedings \u2013 However, the only requirement of law is that the allegation against the delinquent must be established by such evidence acting upon which a reasonable person acting reasonably and with objectivity may arrive at a finding upholding the gravity of the charge against the delinquent employee. Bank/Banking: Bank service \u2013 Misappropriation of funds \u2013 Dismissal from service \u2013 In banking business absolute devotion, integrity and honesty is a sine qua non for every bank employee \u2013 It requires the employee to maintain good conduct and discipline and he deals with money of the depositors and the customers and if it is not observed, the confidence of the public/depositors would be impaired \u2013 For this additional reason, High Court erred in setting aside order of dismissal of respondent against whom findings of the guilt of grave delinquency were established."

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: ss.361 and 366 \u2013 Kidnapping \u2013 Victim- minor girl aged 16 years recovered from custody of appellant \u2013 Appellant admited to having established sexual intercourse and of having an intention to marry the victim \u2013 Conviction under ss.361 and 366 \u2013 Held: For establishing offence of kidnapping, there should be an act of enticing or taking, in addition to establishing the child\u2019s minority (being sixteen for boys and eighteen for girls) and care/keep of a lawful guardian \u2013 Such \u2018enticement\u2019 need not be direct or immediate in time and can also be through subtle actions like winning over the affection of a minor girl \u2013 In the instant case, besides the fact that the victim was recovered from custody of appellant, he also admitted to having established sexual intercourse and of having an intention to marry the prosecutrix \u2013 The testimonies of witnesses made out a clear case of enticement \u2013 The evidence further unequivocally suggested that the appellant induced the prosecutrix to reach at a designated place to accompany him \u2013 Appellant failed to propound how the elements of kidnapping were not made out \u2013 His core contention that in view of consensual affair between them and the prosecutrix joined his company voluntarily cannot be acceded to given the unambiguous language of the statute as the prosecutrix was admittedly below 18 years of age \u2013 A bare perusal of the relevant legal provisions, show that consent of the minor is immaterial for purposes of s.361 \u2013 A minor girl\u2019s infatuation with her alleged kidnapper cannot by itself be allowed as a defence, for the same would amount to surreptitiously undermining the protective essence of the offence of kidnapping \u2013 Similarly, s.366 postulates that once the prosecution leads evidence to show that the kidnapping was with the intention/knowledge to compel marriage of the girl or to force/induce her to have illicit intercourse, the enhanced punishment of 10 years as provided thereunder would stand attracted \u2013 It was not the appellant\u2019s case that he had no active role to play in the occurrence \u2013 Rather, the eye-witnesses testified to the contrary which illustrated how appellant had drawn the prosecutrix out of the custody of her parents \u2013 There is little to suggest that she was aware of the full purport of her actions or that she possessed the mental acuities and maturity to take care of herself \u2013 In addition to being young, she was not much educated \u2013 Courts below were right in observing that the consent of the minor would be no defence to a charge of kidnapping \u2013 No fault can thus be found with the conviction of the appellant under ss.361 and 366 of IPC. Sentence/Sentencing: There cannot be any mechanical reduction of sentence unless all relevant factors have been weighed and whereupon the Court finds it to be a case of gross injustice, hardship, or palpably capricious award of an unreasonable sentence \u2013 It would thus depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case whether a superior Court should interfere with, and resultantly enhance or reduce the sentence \u2013 In the instant case, it is apparent that no force was used in the act of kidnapping \u2013 There was no pre-planning, use of any weapon or any vulgar motive \u2013 Although not a determinative factor, the young age of the accused at the time of the incident cannot be overlooked \u2013 He was no older than about 18 or 19 years at the time of the offence and admittedly it was a case of a love affair \u2013 His actions at such a young and impressionable age, therefore, ought to be treated with hope for reform, and not punitively \u2013 Both the victim and the appellant are now in their forties; are productive members of society and have settled down in life with their respective spouses and families \u2013 It, therefore, might not further the ends of justice to relegate the appellant back to jail at this stage \u2013Given these multiple unique circumstances, the sentence of five years\u2019 rigorous imprisonment awarded by the courts below, is disproportionate to the facts of the this case \u2013 The concerns of both the society and the victim can be respected, and the twin principles of deterrence and correction would be served by reducing the appellant\u2019s sentence to the period of incarceration already undergone by him"

        "HeadNote": "Probation of Offenders Act, 1958: Object of legislation \u2013 Held: To give the benefit of release of offenders on probation of good conduct instead of sentencing them to imprisonment \u2013 Thus, increasing emphasis on the reformation and rehabilitation of offenders as useful and self-reliant members of society without subjecting them to deleterious effects of jail life is what is sought to be subserved. Probation of Offenders Act, 1958: s.6 \u2013 Appellants were convicted by trial court for offence under s.397 IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment of seven years each \u2013 High Court dismissed the appeal against the conviction by trial court \u2013 Appellants filed special leave petition and annexed compromise deed arrived at between the complainant and the appellants in terms whereof the complainant had stated that he did not want to pursue any action against the appellants and has no objection to their release on bail on acquittal \u2013 Appellants have already served about 50% of their sentence while in custody \u2013 The prosecution however objected that the minimum sentence provided by the statute under s.397 IPC is seven years and the same cannot be reduced below that period \u2013 On this submission, the appellants-convicts sought benefit under the Probation of Offenders Act \u2013 Held: Appellants were below 21 years of age as on the date of offence \u2013 The benefit of probation under the Act is not excluded by the provisions of the mandatory minimum sentence under s.397 of IPC, the offence in the present case \u2013 Appellants have not served out the minimum sentence of seven years though they have served about half the sentences \u2013 They were aged under 19 and 21 years of age as on the date of offence but not on the date of sentence \u2013 The redeeming feature in their case is that the person who suffered, appears to  have forgiven them, possibly with the passage of time \u2013 No adverse report has been brought to notice against them about their conduct in jail \u2013 Fit case to extend benefit of probation to the appellants under the Act in view of the provisions of s.4 of the Act on completion of half the sentence \u2013 Appellants are released on probation of good conduct under s.4 of the Act on their completion of half the sentence and on their entering into a bond with two sureties each to ensure that they will maintain peace and good behaviour for the remaining part of their sentence, failing which they can be called upon to serve that part of the sentence \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.397. Probation of Offenders Act, 1958: s.4 \u2013 Essential feature of \u2013 Held: \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d contained in s.4 permits, despite anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the court to release a person on bond, with or without sureties, for a period of three years instead of sentencing him in order to ensure that he keeps peace and good behaviour \u2013 In this regard, under sub-section (2), before making any order under sub-section (1), the court is required to take into consideration the report, if any, of the probation officer concerned in relation to the case. Probation of Offenders Act, 1958: s.6 \u2013 Determining factors while giving benefit under \u2013 Held: The relevant aspects while giving benefit under s.6 of the Act are: the nature of offence, the character of the offender, and the surrounding circumstances as recorded in the probation officer\u2019s report.  Probation of Offenders Act, 1958: s.4 and s.6 \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Held: s.4 is distinct from s.6 as it is discretionary in nature while s.6 provides that a court \u201cmust not\u201d sentence a person under the age of 21 years to imprisonment unless sufficient reasons for the same are recorded, based on due consideration of the probation officer\u2019s report. G Probation of Offenders Act, 1958: s.6 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: Appellants were under 21 years of age on the date of the offence and not on the date of conviction, s.6 would not come to their aid."

Environmental laws: Environmental rule of law \u2013 Essential features of \u2013 Held: It seeks to facilitate a multi-disciplinary analysis of the nature and consequences of carbon footprints and in doing so it brings a shared understanding between science, regulatory decisions and policy perspectives in the field of environmental protection \u2013 It recognises that the \u2018law\u2019 element in the environmentalrule of law does not make the concept peculiarly the preserve of lawyers and judges \u2013 On the contrary, it seeks to draw within the fold all stakeholders in formulating strategies to deal with current challenges posed by environmental degradation, climate change and the destruction of habitats \u2013 Environmental rule of law seeks a unified understanding of these concepts \u2013 There are significant linkages between concepts such as sustainable development, the polluter pays principle and the trust doctrine. Environmental rule of law \u2013 Violation of \u2013 In the case in hand, the exact effect of the construction of the Hotel-cum-Restaurant structure by the appellant and the second respondent on the ecology of the area cannot be determined in quantifiable terms \u2013 The parties engaged in the construction without complying with the plans drawn by the appellant\u2019s third-party consultants, which were agreed to by them in the RFP \u2013 The construction proceeded even when the TCP Department tried to halt it, refusing to approve its plans \u2013 Even the post facto refusal by the MOEF for changing the nature of the diverted forest land was not enough to stop the parties \u2013 Ultimately, when they were forced to halt the construction by the CEC, they proceeded with it under the guise of an order of this Court which permitted only legal construction \u2013 A combination of these circumstances highlighted not only conduct oblivious of the environmental consequences of their actions, but an active disdain for them in favour of commercial benefits \u2013 While the second respondent was a private entity, they were actively supported in these efforts by the appellant \u2013 Hence, their actions stood in violation of the environmental rule of law \u2013 The environmental rule of law surely means that construction of this sort cannot receive acceptance, no matter what its economic benefits may be. Jurisprudence: Rule of law and Rule by the law \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 In a constitutional framework which is intended to create, foster and protect a democracy committed to liberal values, the rule of law provides the cornerstone \u2013 The rule of law is to be distinguished from rule by the law \u2013 The former comprehends the setting up of a legal regime with clearly defined rules and principles of even application, a regime of law which maintains the fundamental postulates of liberty, equality and due process \u2013 The rule of law postulates a law which is answerable to constitutionalnorms \u2013 The law in that sense is accountable as much as it is capable of exacting compliance \u2013 Rule by the law on the other hand can mean rule by a despotic law \u2013 It is to maintain the just quality of the law and its observance of reason that rule of law precepts in constitutional democracies rest on constitutional foundations \u2013 A rule of law framework dwells on the institutions which provide the arc of governance \u2013 By focussing on the structural norms which guide institutional decision making, rule of law frameworks recognise the vital role played by institutions and the serious consequences of leaving undefined the norms and processes by which they are constituted, composed and governed \u2013 A modern rule of law framework is hence comprehensive in its sweep and ambit \u2013 It recognises that liberty and equality are the focal point of a just system of governance and without which human dignity can be subverted by administrative discretion and absolute power \u2013 Rule of law then dwells beyond a compendium which sanctifies rules of law \u2013 Its elements comprise of substantive principles, processual guarantees and institutional safeguards that are designed to ensure responsive, accountable and sensitive governance. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Whether the NGT could have adjudicated upon a violation of the TCP Act, which is not an Act present in Schedule I of the NGT Act \u2013 Held: The provisions of the TCP Act required the appellant and second respondent to take prior permission from the TCP Department before changing the nature of the land through their construction \u2013 Non-conformity with this stipulation led to a violation of their environmental obligations \u2013 In any case, this question is academic in the instant case because the NGT\u2019s impugned judgment grounds its decision in the appellant and second respondent\u2019s violation of s.2 of the Forest Act, which is an Act present within Schedule I of the NGT Act \u2013 Forest Act \u2013 s.2 \u2013 Himachal Pradesh Town and Country Planning Act, 1977."

Jurisdiction: Jurisdiction of the Court to pass interim orders pending decision on question of its\u2019 jurisdiction \u2013 Held: Even if objection is raised to the jurisdiction of a forum, it has jurisdiction to pass interim orders till it finally decides the issue of jurisdiction and such orders are binding on the parties till the issue of jurisdiction is decided \u2013 If the Court holds that it has no jurisdiction, it is open to it to modify the orders \u2013 However, while in force, the interim orders passed by such Court have to be obeyed and their violation can be punished even after the question of jurisdiction is decided against the plaintiff, provided violation is committed before the decision of the Court on the question of jurisdiction \u2013 Judgment /Order \u2013 Interim Order. Civil Contempt: Wilful disobedience or wilful breach \u2013 Court has to record a finding that such a disobedience was wilful & intentional \u2013 There must be a clear cut case of obstruction of justice by a party intentionally \u2013 Where the court is satisfied that such disobedience is the result of some compelling circumstances, under which it is not possible for the contemnor to comply with the same, the Court may not punish the alleged contemnor"

Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 It is well settled that in construing a statutory provision, words in the singular are to include the plural and vice versa, unless repugnant to the context in which the expression has been used, as provided in s.13(2) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and provisions identical thereto in State enactments pertaining to General Clauses."

Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 Art. 137 \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 ss. 7 and 9 \u2013 In B.K. Educational Services Private Ltd. v.

Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 Art. 137 \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s. 7 \u2013 Held: In Gaurav Hargovindbhai Dave v. Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Ltd. and Ors. (2019) 10 SCC 572, it was held that \u201can application\u201d which is filed u/s. 7, would fall only within the residuary Art. 137."

Interpretation of statutes: Purposive interpretation \u2013 It is well- settled that the Courts may, in order to avoid any difficulty or injustice resulting from inadvertent ambiguity in the language of a statute, mould the interpretation of the same so as to achieve the true purpose of the enactment \u2013 This may include expanding the scope of the relevant provisions to cover situations which are not strictly encapsulated in the language used therein."

        "HeadNote": "Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Importance/reliability of ossification test \u2013 When a person is around 18 years of age, the ossification test can be said to be relevant for determining the approximate age of a person in conflict with law \u2013 However, when a person is around 40-55 years of age, the structure of bones cannot be helpful in determining the age \u2013 When the ossification test cannot yield trustworthy and reliable results, such test cannot be made a basis to determine the age of the person concerned on the date of incident \u2013 Therefore, in the instant case, in the absence of any reliable trustworthy medical evidence to find out age of the appellant, the ossification test conducted in year 2020 when the appellant was 55 years of age cannot be conclusive to declare him as a juvenile on the date of the incident i.e. 20.07.1982. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Determination of age \u2013 As per the Scheme of the Act, when it is obvious to the Committee or the Board, based on the appearance of the person, that the said person is a child, the Board or Committee shall record observations stating the age of the Child as nearly as may be without waiting for further confirmation of the age \u2013 Therefore, the first attempt to determine the age is by assessing the physical appearance of the person when brought before the Board or the Committee \u2013 It is only in case of doubt, the process of age determination by seeking evidence becomes necessary \u2013 At that stage, when a person is around 18 years of age, the ossification test can be said to be relevant for determining the approximate age of a person in conflict with law. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Conviction of appellant under s.302 r/w s.34 IPC \u2013 Appellant raised plea of juvenility \u2013 In support thereof, he relied on an order passed by High Court in 1982 granting bail to him on the basis of report of radiologist that the age of appellant at the time of incident wasbetween 15-1/2-17-1/2 years \u2013 Plea of juvenility raised before this court on the basis of said order of High Court \u2013 Held: The medical report in support of the bail order is not available \u2013 Such order granting bail cannot be conclusive determination of age of the appellant \u2013 It was an interim order of bail pending trial but in the absence of a medical report, it cannot be conclusively held that the appellant was juvenile on the date of the incident \u2013 Apart from that an application was submitted by the appellant himself for obtaining an Arms Licence prior to the date of the incident \u2013 In such application, he had given his date of birth as 30.12.1961 which made him 21 years of age on the date of the incident i.e. 20.7.1982 \u2013 The Court is not precluded from taking into consideration any other relevant and trustworthy material to determine the age as all the three eventualities mentioned in sub-section (2) of s.94 of the Act are either not available or are not found to be reliable and trustworthy \u2013 Since there was such document signed by the appellant much before the date of occurrence, therefore, he cannot be treated to be juvenile on the date of incident. Juvenile Justice: Plea of juvenility \u2013 Held: Can be raised at any stage even after finality of the proceedings before Supreme Court. Penal Code, 1860: s.302 r/w s.34 \u2013 The oral evidence along with the statement of the doctor (PW-4) suggested that the injuries on the head of the deceased were caused by a blunt weapon \u2013 The blunt weapon as deposed by the eyewitness was the lathi in the hands of the appellant \u2013 Lathi may be common article with the villagers but the use of lathi as a weapon of offence is a finding of fact recorded by the Courts below \u2013 As per the postmortem report, the deceased suffered multiple injuries which showed attack by more than one person \u2013 The nature of injuries also showed that hard and blunt object as well as sharp edged weapons were used to inflict injuries \u2013 It was the appellant who was armed with Lathi whereas the other convicted accused was armed with Axe \u2013 The incised wound suffered by the deceased was possible with an Axe \u2013 As per the report, there were sufficient number of injuries caused by an Axe and Lathi on the person of the deceased \u2013 Trial court as well as the High Court had appreciated the entire evidence to return a finding of guilt against the appellant \u2013 No interference with the order of conviction.Witness: A part statement of a witness can be believed even though some part of the statement may not be relied upon by the court \u2013 The maxim Falsus in Uno, Falsus in Omnibus is not the rule applied by the courts in India. Witness: Number of witnesses, relevance \u2013 It is not necessary for the prosecution to examine all the witnesses who might have witnessed the occurrence \u2013 It is the quality of evidence which is relevant in criminal trial and not the quantity."

Appeal against acquittal: An appeal against acquittal has always been on an altogether different pedestal from an appeal against conviction \u2013 In an appeal against acquittal, where the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused is reinforced, the appellate court would interfere with the order of acquittal only when there is perversity \u2013 In this case, it cannot be said that the reasons given by the High Court to reverse the conviction of the accused were flimsy, untenable or bordering on perverse appreciation of evidence. Criminal law: Case based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn must fully be established and the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused \u2013 There has to be a chain of evidence so complete, as not to leave any reasonable doubt for any conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability, the act must have been done by the accused."

Union of India held that the Aadhaar Act was correctly certified as a \u2018Money Bill\u2019 u/Art.110 (1) \u2013 Held: (Per Majority) no case for review of Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5J) v. Union of India [2018] 8 SCR 1: (2019) 1 SCC 1, judgment and order dated 26.09.2018 is made out \u2013 The change in the law or subsequent decision/judgment of a coordinate or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review \u2013 (Per Minority: Dr. Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud) If these review petitions are to be dismissed and the larger Bench reference in Rojer Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd. [2019] 16 SCR 1: (2020) 6 SCC 1 were to disagree with the analysis of the majority opinion in Puttaswamy (Aadhaar- 5J.), it would have serious consequences-not just for judicial discipline, but also for the ends of justice \u2013 As such, the present batch of review petitions should be kept pending until the larger Bench decides the questions referred to it in Rojer Mathew. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 110 \u2013 Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016Held: Per Dr Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud: The correctness of Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5J.) on issues pertaining to, and arising from, the certification of a Bill as a \u2018Money Bill\u2019 by the Speaker of the House of People was doubted by a co-ordinate Constitution Bench in Rojer Mathew \u2013 With the doubt expressed by another Constitution Bench on the correctness of the very decision which is the subject matter of these review petitions, it is a constitutional error to hold at this stage that no ground exists to review the judgment"

        "HeadNote": "Partition: Suit for partition \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 Plaintiff and defendants Nos. 1 to 3 were co-sharer \u2013 Claim for partition was in respect of property of their step-mother \u2013 Defendant no.4 was brother of step mother \u2013 Allegations in the plaint was that defendant no.4 obtained her thumb impression on papers after her death \u2013 However, no specific reference was made of any agreement for sale or fabrication of particular document \u2013 Plea regarding execution of the agreement for sale by step mother and Will came up only in the written statement filed by defendant 4 \u2013 Record showed that only after such plea by defendant 4 in his written statement that the legatee under the Will and the vendee in the agreement were added as defendants 14 and 15 respectively \u2013 Plaintiff denied the execution of Will and agreement and submitted that defendants 14 and 15 did not have any right in the property and their claims were liable to be ignored, however, plaintiff did not seek any relief of declaration, whether against the Will or against the agreement \u2013 Plea about non-maintainability of suit for want for relief of declaration against the agreement for sale not sustainable \u2013 Held: A person having an agreement for sale in his favour does not get any right in the property, except the right of obtaining sale deed on that basis \u2013 The alleged agreement for sale did not invest the vendee with title to, or any interest in, the property in question; and the alleged agreement for sale did not invest the vendee with any such right that the plaintiff could not have maintained her claim for partition in respect of the properties left by her step mother without seeking declaration against the agreement \u2013 Transfer of Property Act, 1882 \u2013 s.54. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: Or.XXII rr.2, 4 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 r.2 of Or.XXII of the Code ordains the procedure where one of the several plaintiffs or defendants dies and right to sue survives tothe surviving plaintiff(s) alone, or against the surviving defendant(s) alone \u2013 The same procedure applies in appeal where one of the several appellants or respondents dies and right to sue survives to the surviving appellant(s) alone, or against the surviving respondent(s) alone \u2013 However, by virtue of r.4 read with r.11 of Or.XXII of the Code, in case of death of one of the several respondents, where right to sue does not survive against the surviving respondent or respondents as also in the case where the sole respondent dies and the right to sue survives, the contemplated procedure is that the legal representatives of the deceased respondent are to be substituted in his place; and if no application is made for such substitution within the time limited by law, the appeal abates as against the deceased respondent \u2013 In the instant case, it is not the case that no legal heirs were available for defendant 2 \u2013 It is also not the case where the estate of the deceased defendant 2 passed on to the remaining parties by survivorship or otherwise \u2013 Therefore, applicability of r.2 of Or.XXII is clearly ruled out \u2013 Admittedly, steps were not taken for substitution of the legal representatives of defendant 2 \u2013 Therefore, sub-rule (3) of r.4 of Or.XXII of the Code directly came into operation and the said appeal filed by defendants 16 to 18 abated against defendant 2. Deeds and documents: Intermixing of two documents \u2013 In the instant case, in the Will (Ex. B-9), apart from making bequest, allegedly the testator also directed her mother (legatee) to execute a registered sale deed in favour of defendant 15 after receiving the balance sale consideration from him as per the agreement executed in his favour and also directed to discharge the debts \u2013 The agreement mentioned in the Will was none other than Ex. B-10 \u2013 Looking to the nature, purport and contents of these documents, time gap between the two is not of much relevance when examining the questions about their validity and genuineness; and in any case, the sale agreement (Ex. B-10) did not remain an independent or stand-alone document once it was found that this document was indeed mentioned in the disputed Will and the obligations thereunder were purportedly passed on to the legatee \u2013 Moreover, the Will also required the legatee to pay the debts of the testator \u2013 The defendants also suggested the indebtedness of testator to be the reason for sale of the property in question \u2013 Putting all the things together,indebtedness of testator and her agreeing to sell the property to defendant 15 formed an integral part of the alleged Will \u2013 Therefore, the two documents could not have been segregated \u2013 Trial Court as also the High Court recorded concurrent findings that the document of Will (Ex. B-9) was a highly suspicious document and the propounders have failed to remove the suspicious circumstances \u2013 A submission was made before the High Court that when the Will (Ex. B-9) was found surrounded by suspicious circumstances, the agreement (Ex. B-10) must also be rejected as a necessary corollary \u2013 High Court rejected this contention with reference to the fact that the agreement (Ex. B-10) was prior in time and was an independent document which could be enforced as such \u2013 While examining preponderance of probabilities about existence of such an agreement for sale, the overall relationship of the parties, the beneficiaries of the alleged agreement and their conduct cannot be kept at bay \u2013 The alleged agreement is intertwined with the rejected Will because of the specific contents of the latter \u2013 Therefore, the repercussions of findings against genuineness of the Will are bound to impact the agreement too \u2013 The consideration of the High Court suffered from the fundamental error of approach."

        "HeadNote": "Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Claims and legal liabilities crystallise at the time of accident itself \u2013 Any changes post thereto, ought not to ordinarily affect pending proceedings \u2013 Just like how claimants cannot rely upon subsequent increases in minimum wages, the insurer too cannot seek benefit of the subsequent death of a dependent during the pendency of legal proceedings \u2013 Similarly, any concession in law made in this regard by either counsel would not bind the parties. B C D Concession in law: Permissibility, extent of \u2013 Held: Advocates cannot throw away legal rights or enter into arrangements contrary to law \u2013 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Assessment of income in the absence of evidence \u2013 Held: In the instant case, although it is correct that the claimants were unable to produce any document evidencing victim-husband\u2019s income, nor they established his employment as a teacher; but that would not justify adoption of the lowest-tier of minimum wage while computing his income \u2013 From the statement of witnesses, documentary evidence-on-record and circumstances of the accident, it is apparent that victim was comparatively more educationally qualified and skilled \u2013 Further, he maintained a reasonable standard of living for his family as evidenced by his use of a motorcycle for commuting \u2013 Preserving theexisting standard of living of a deceased\u2019s family is a fundamental endeavour of motor accident compensation law \u2013 Thus, the minimum wage of Rs 6197 as applicable to skilled workers applied in his case.   Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Future prospects \u2013 In case the deceased was self-employed or on a fixed salary, an addition of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years \u2013 An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation \u2013 The established income means the income minus the tax component \u2013 The argument that no future prospects ought to be allowed for those with notional income, is both incorrect in law and without merit considering the constant inflation-induced increase in wages. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Calculation of notional income for homemakers and the grant of future prospects with respect to them, for the purposes of grant of compensation \u2013 Determining factors, discussed.

Pratap Karan that the Government of Andhra Pradesh did not have title to the project land \u2013 During the years 2012 and 2013, Unitech called upon APIIC to execute the sale deed, handover the project site and ensure that the encumbrances on the project land are cleared in terms of Development Agreement so as to comply with its obligations \u2013 The State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised w.e.f. 02.06.2014 \u2013 Request was made to newly formed TSIIC (successor of APIIC) to clarify the status \u2013 On 02.04.2015, Unitech sought release of earnest money deposit of Rs.20 crores in light of full payment of consideration \u2013 On 09.10.2015, Supreme Court in Pratap Karan case upheld the judgment of the High Court \u2013 Thereafter, on 14.10.2015, Unitech requested APIIC and TSIIC, to refund all the amounts which were received in relation to the land together with interest and damages for the loss suffered by them \u2013 Writ petition under Art.226 was instituted before the High Court seeking a refund of Rs 165 crores together with interest at the SBI Prime Lending Rate (\u201cSBI- PLR\u201d) from the date of payments \u2013 A Single Judge of the High Court allowed Unitech\u2019s Writ Petition \u2013 Writ Appeal by TSIIC and the State of Telangana \u2013 The Division Bench of the High Court while upholding order of Single Judge on liability of TSIIC directed refund of the principal sum of Rs 165 crores with interest from 14.10.2015 at the SBI-PLR, as opposed to the dates of payment of installments, beginning from September 2007 \u2013 Appeal by Unitech \u2013 Held: Under the Development Agreement which was executed between APIIC and Unitech, APIIC was to transfer the land absolutely free from all encumbrances by executing a sale agreement \u2013 The terms of the agreement were to prevail in the event of any conflict with any other document which formed a part of the bidding process \u2013 Thus, the terms of the agreement were placed on the pedestal of the highest priority for interpretation, as compared to other documents, including the LoA \u2013 Under the terms of the Development Agreement, APIIC was obligated to sell and transfer the land together with its right, title and interest free from all encumbrances \u201cforthwith upon payment of the last installment of the total purchase price by the developer\u201d \u2013 The fulfillment of the terms of the agreement was postulated on the availability of the land \u2013 The failure of title in the erstwhile APIIC and the Government of Andhra Pradesh attained finality upon the decision of Supreme Court \u2013 The basic postulate on which the entire contract was founded stood nullified as a consequence of the failure of title \u2013 The agreement clearly provides that the ability of the Government of Andhra Pradesh/TSIIC to convey full title to the developer forms the basis of the contract \u2013 The failure of title entitled Unitech to claim a full refund together with compensatory payment, as contractually defined \u2013 Further, the Development Agreement provides that compensatory payment will be \u201cfrom the date on which the first payment of project price\u201d is made \u2013 The Division Bench was in error in curtailing the right of Unitech to claim a refund with effect from the dates on which the respective payments were made \u2013 Unitech cannot be penalized for wanting to continue with the agreement, as APIIC navigated disputes over its claim to the land \u2013 While Unitech was put to notice of the existence of a litigation, the Development Agreement which stipulated an encumbrance-free handover also specified that its covenants would supersede all other understandings and that its terms would rank as the first, in order of interpretive priority \u2013 The judgment of the Division Bench suffers from a clear and patent error in restricting the liability of paying interest w.e.f. 14.10.2015 \u2013 The liability must date back, in terms of the Development Agreement, from the date on which the respective payments were made by Unitech \u2013 Interest at the contractual SBI- PLR rate has to be paid to Unitech \u2013 However, considering the position of Unitech which knowingly entered into the Development Agreement with full knowledge of the pending litigation and with an intention to continue with the project after a delay of over seven years, up until a decision by this Court, the interest rate is payable to Unitech, without compounding. Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014: Apportionment of the liabilities between the instrumentalities of the State of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana \u2013 The land which is comprised in the project site falls exclusively within the Telangana region as specified in the demerger scheme \u2013 TSIIC shall refund the amounts due and payable to Unitech in terms of the present judgment \u2013 TSIIC would be at liberty to pursue its rights and remedies in accordance with law over its claim for apportionment. Stamp duty: Unstamped agreement \u2013 The Development Agreement, on the basis of which Unitech sought to avail its contractual remedy has not been registered or assessed to stamp duty \u2013 Under Article 3.1 of the Development Agreement, the obligation of paying registration fees and stamp duty is on Unitech \u2013 Stamp Act is a fiscal measure enacted to secure the revenue for the State, and not to arm the opponent with a weapon of technicality \u2013 Unitech\u2019s claim to compensatory payment cannot be defeated on the sole ground of the payment of stamp duty \u2013 Directions passed to impound the Development Agreement and present it to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority in the State of Telangana for assessment of stamp duty and to the competent authority for registration \u2013 The assessment shall be completed within thirty days \u2013 The appropriate stamp duty and registration charges shall be paid by TSIIC and be deducted from the refund due and payable to Unitech under the terms of this order. Constitution of India: Art.226 \u2013 Writ jurisdiction \u2013 The jurisdiction under Art.226 is a valuable constitutional safeguard against an arbitrary exercise of state power or a misuse of authority \u2013 In determining as to whether jurisdiction should be exercised in a contractual dispute, the Court must, undoubtedly eschew, disputed questions of fact which would depend upon an evidentiary determination requiring a trial \u2013 But equally, it is well-settled that the jurisdiction under Art.226 cannot be ousted only on the basis that the dispute pertains to the contractual arena \u2013 This is for the simple reason that the State and its instrumentalities are not exempt from the duty to act fairly merely because in their business dealings they have entered into the realm of contract \u2013 Similarly, the presence of an arbitration clause does oust the jurisdiction under Art.226 in all cases though, it still needs to be decided from case to case as to whether recourse to public law remedy can justifiably be invoked \u2013 Contract. Constitution of India: Art.14 \u2013 The State and its instrumentalities are duty bound to act fairly under Art.14 of the Constitution \u2013 They cannot, even in the domain of contract, claim an exemption from the public law duty to act fairly \u2013 The State and its instrumentalities do not shed either their character or their obligation to act fairly in their dealings with private parties in the realm of contract \u2013 Investors who respond to the representations held out by the State while investing in public projects are legitimately entitled to assert that the representations must be fulfilled and to enforce compliance with duties which have been contractually assumed."
