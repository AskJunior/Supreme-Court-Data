[Para 23(ii), (iii)]Himachal Pradesh Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1955 \u2013Himachal Pradesh Passengers and Goods (Amendment and Validation)Act of 1997 \u2013 The Division Bench of the High Court passed a judgmentdated 27.03.1997 and pointed out lacunae in the Act of 1955 \u2013 By way ofthe Amendment and Validation Act of 1997, amendments were broughtabout to the Preamble and various provisions of the Act of 1955 withretrospective eff ect, viz. date of enforcement of the Act of 1955 \u2013 Whena competent legislature retrospectively removes the substratum orfoundation of a judgment to make it ineff ective \u2013 Valid legislativeexercise or not:Held: A legislature cannot directly set aside a judicial decision\u2013 However, when a competent legislature retrospectively removes thesubstratum or foundation of a judgment to make the decision ineff ective, thesame is a valid legislative exercise provided it does not transgress on anyother constitutional limitation \u2013 Such a legislative device which removesthe vice in the previous legislation which has been declared unconstitutionalis not considered to be an encroachment on judicial power but an instanceof abrogation recognised under the Constitution of India \u2013 The variousdecisions of the Supreme Court show that it is open to the legislature toalter the law retrospectively, provided the alteration is made in such amanner that it would no more be possible for the Court to arrive at the sameverdict \u2013 In other words, the very premise of the earlier judgment should beremoved, thereby resulting in a fundamental change of the circumstancesupon which it was founded \u2013 It would be permissible for the legislature toremove a defect in an earlier legislation, as pointed out by a constitutionalcourt in exercise of its powers by way of judicial review \u2013 This defect canbe removed both prospectively and retrospectively by a legislative processand previous actions can also be validated. [Paras 11 and 12]Constitution of India \u2013 Alteration of law retrospectively \u2013Separation of powers between legislature, executive and the judiciary\u2013 Power of Judicial Review \u2013 Power of Legislature \u2013 Rule of Law:Held: The role of the judiciary in galvanising constitutional machinerycharacterised by institutional checks and balances, lies in recognising that while due deference must be shown to the powers and actions of the othertwo branches of the government, the power of judicial review may beexercised to restrain unconstitutional and arbitrary exercise of power by thelegislature and executive organs \u2013 The power of judicial review is a partof the basic feature of Constitution which is premised on the rule of law \u2013Unless a judgment has been set aside by a competent court in an appropriateproceeding, fi nality and binding nature of a judgment are essential facetsof the rule of law informing the power of judicial review \u2013 In that context,while it may be open to the legislature to alter the law retrospectively, soas to remove the basis of a judgment declaring such law to be invalid, it isessential that the alteration is made only so as to bring the law in line withthe decision of the Court \u2013 Simply setting at naught a decision of a courtwithout removing the defects pointed out in the said decision, would soundthe death knell for the rule of law \u2013 The rule of law would cease to haveany meaning if the legislature is at liberty to defy a judgment of a courtby simply passing a validating legislation, without removing the defectsforming the substratum of the judgment by use of a non-obstante clause asa technique to do so. [Para 13]Constitution of India \u2013 Legislative device of abrogation \u2013Retrospective amendments \u2013 Permissibility of:Held: The device of abrogation, by way of introducing retrospectiveamendments to remove the basis of a judgment, may be employed whena legislature is under the bonafi de belief that a defect that crept into thelegislation as it initially stood, may be remedied by abrogation \u2013 An act ofabrogation is permissible only in the interests of justice, eff ectiveness andgood governance, and not to serve the oblique agenda of defying a court\u2019sorder, or stripping it of its binding nature. [Para 14]Constitution of India \u2013 The power of abrogation is to be exercisedfollowing principles:Held: (i) There is no legal impediment to enacting a law to validate alegislation which has been held by a court to be invalid, provided, such a lawremoves the basis of the judgment of the court, by curing the defects of thelegislation as it stood before the amendment; (ii) The validating legislationmay be retrospective \u2013 It must have the eff ect that the judgment pointingout the defect would not have been passed, if the altered position as sought to be brought in by the validating statute existed before the court at thetime of rendering its judgment; (iii) Retrospective amendment should bereasonable and not arbitrary and must not be violative of any Constitutionallimitations; (iv) Setting at naught a decision of a court without removingthe defect pointed out in the said decision is opposed to the rule of law andthe scheme of separation of powers under the Constitution of India; (v)Abrogation is not a device to circumvent an unfavourable judicial decision\u2013 If enacted solely with the intention to defy a judicial pronouncement, anAmendment and Validation Act of 1997 may be declared as ultra-vires.[Para 15]Himachal Pradesh Passengers and Goods Taxation Act, 1955 \u2013Himachal Pradesh Passengers and Goods (Amendment and Validation)Act of 1997 \u2013 Import of the Act of 1955 Act as amended by theAmendment and Validation act of 1997:Held: The Preamble which provides that it has been enacted toprovide for levying a tax on passengers and goods carried by road in motorvehicles \u2013 Such a tax falls within the legislative fi eld governed by Entry56 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution \u2013 Simply for thereason that notices have been issued to the owners or assessment ordershave been passed against the owners of the vehicles, it cannot be said thatthe tax is levied on the motor vehicles \u2013 If the persons carried happen tobe employees of the owners of the buses, such employees should pay thetax \u2013 When the employer, i.e., the owner of the vehicle, does not collectthe tax from such employees, he should himself pay it, in discharge ofthe employer\u2019s statutory duty as an agent of the State to collect tax on thebasis of the amended provision \u2013 Whether to collect the tax payable fromthe passengers (the employees and their children) or discharge the liabilityitself is the prerogative of the appellants.

[Paras 13, 15, 16 and 17]Practice and Procedure \u2013 Acquittal \u2013 Interference by appellateCourt:Held: An appellate court, in the case of an acquittal, must bear inmind that there is a double presumption in favour of the accused \u2013 Whentwo views are possible, the one favouring the accused is to be leaned on \u2013Criminal Law.

[Para 16]Practice and Procedure \u2013 Inter-departmental communications \u2013Reliance upon:Held: Inter-departmental communications are in the process ofconsideration for appropriate decision and cannot be relied upon as a basisto claim any right \u2013 In the present case, it was rightly contended that theLegal Opinion by the Law Department remains internal advice, and advicealone, and the same would not create/confer any right in favour of R1 \u2013Elections \u2013 Administrative Law.

[Para 22]Elections \u2013 Power of Supreme court to bring back status quoante:Held: Plea of the Appellants that no relief be granted to R1 dueto the election process having reached the penultimate stage, rejected\u2013 Having chosen to not comply with successive orders of the HighCourt which were passed well in time, such as not to stall/delay thenotifi ed election schedule, the Appellants cannot be permitted to pleadthat interference by Supreme Court at this late juncture should notbe forthcoming \u2013 No litigant should have even an iota of doubt ormisimpression that just because of systemic delay or the matter notbeing taken up by the Courts resulting in effl ux of time the cause wouldbe defeated, and the Court would be rendered helpless to ensure justiceto the party concerned \u2013 This Court can even turn the clock back, if thesituation warrants such dire measures \u2013 Powers of this Court, if needbe, to even restore status quo ante are not in the realm of any doubt, asheld in Nabam Rebia and Bamang Felix v.

[Paras 31 and 32]Practice and Procedure \u2013 High Courts not deciding cases onthe ground that the leading judgment of Supreme Court on subjectconcerned is either referred to a larger Bench or a review petitionrelating thereto is pending \u2013 High Courts refusing deference tojudgments as a later Coordinate Bench has doubted its correctness\u2013 Law laid down:Held: High Courts will proceed to decide matters on the basis of thelaw as it stands \u2013 It is not open, unless specifi cally directed by SupremeCourt, to await an outcome of a reference or a review petition, as the casemay be \u2013 It is also not open to a High Court to refuse to follow a judgmentby stating that it has been doubted by a later Coordinate Bench \u2013 Further,in any case, when faced with confl icting judgments by Benches of equalstrength of Supreme Court, it is the earlier one which is to be followed bythe High Courts \u2013 Judicial Discipline. [Para 35]Judgments/Orders \u2013 Interpretation of:Held: By way of certain pronouncements, principles relating toelections to Parliament, State Assemblies and Municipalities have beenextended to other arenas as well \u2013 However, interpretation of judgmentsis always to be made with due regard to the facts and circumstances of thepeculiar case concerned \u2013 In the present case, having looked at Articles243-O, 243ZG and 329 it is concluded that no bar hit the High Court, evenon principle \u2013 Elections \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Articles 243-O, 243ZGand 329. [Para 36]Elections \u2013 Election process started \u2013 Interference byConstitutional Courts:Held: The self-imposed restraint by the Courts as a generalprinciple in election matters, to the extent that once a notificationis issued and the election process starts, the Constitutional Courts,under normal circumstances are loath to interfere, is not a contentiousissue \u2013 But where issues crop up, indicating unjust executive actionor an attempt to disturb a level-playing field between candidatesand/or political parties with no justifiable or intelligible basis, the Constitutional Courts are required, nay they are duty-bound, to stepin \u2013 Constitution of India. [Para 37]Elections \u2013 Authorities concerned using their powers relatingto elections arbitrarily \u2013 Misconceived notion that eventually, afterelections are over and when such decisions/actions are challenged, bysheer passage of time, irreversible consequences would have occurred,and no substantive relief could be fashioned \u2013 Taken note of:Held: Such conduct by authorities may seriously compel the Court tohave a comprehensive re-think, as to whether the self-imposed restrictionsmay need a more liberal interpretation, to ensure that justice is not only donebut also seen to be done, and done in time to nip in the bud any attemptedmisadventure. [Para 39]Elections \u2013 Importance of symbol in an electoral system, especiallyone allotted to a political party \u2013 Discussed."

Accused nos. 1, 5 and 13 were acquitted in appeal by the Supreme Court. (a) Whether conviction of appellant-accused no.6 justifi ed; (b) Whether conviction of accused no. 2, 3, 4 was justifi ed, when role ascribed to them was that they were part of mob.Evidence \u2013 Conviction of appellant-accused no.6 based on sole testimony of PW-2 \u2013 Propriety:Held: Considering the nature of the testimony of PW-2, it cannot be said that the evidence of PW-2 is wholly reliable \u2013 The identifi cation of the appellant for the fi rst time in the Court after a lapse of about two years becomes doubtful for more than one reason \u2013 Firstly, the appellant was not known to PW-2 \u2013 Secondly, the appellant was part of a large aggressive mob of 50 to 100 people which surrounded the auto-rickshaw \u2013 Thirdly, there was no identifi cation parade held \u2013 Fourthly, there was no time available to PW-2 to note the distinctive features of the appellant \u2013 Hence, it is very unsafe to record a conclusion based only on the testimony of the solitary witness that the guilt of the appellant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt \u2013 Even if the evidence of PW-2 is categorized as \u201cneither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable,\u201d the appellant cannot be convicted only based on the sole testimony of PW-2 unless there is a corroboration to the version of PW-2 either by direct or circumstantial evidence \u2013 Such a corroboration is completely absent in this case \u2013 Therefore, the conviction of the appellant cannot be sustained. [Para 8]Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Conviction of accused nos. 2, 3, 4 \u2013 Propriety:Held: The conviction of accused nos. 1, 5 and 13 was based only on the testimony of PW-25 and PW-26 \u2013 The Supreme Court had in its earlier decision rejected the testimony of PW-25 and PW-26 in its entirety \u2013 Assuming that PW-25 and PW-26 identifi ed accused nos.2, 3 and 4 by stating that they were members of the mob; once a Coordinate Bench of the Supreme Court discards their testimony in its entirety being unreliable, the benefi t of the said fi nding will have to be extended to the accused nos.2, 3, and 4 as they are similarly placed with accused nos.1,5 and 13 \u2013 Therefore, the conviction of accused nos.2, 3 and 4 set aside. [Paras 11, 12 and 14]Evidence \u2013 Similar or identical evidence of eyewitnesses against accused persons \u2013 Principle of parity:Held: When there is similar or identical evidence of eyewitnesses against two accused by ascribing them the same or similar role, the Court cannot convict one accused and acquit the other \u2013 In such a case, the cases of both the accused will be governed by the principle of parity \u2013 This principle means that the Criminal Court should decide like cases alike, and in such cases, the Court cannot make a distinction between the two accused, which will amount to discrimination. [Para 15]Constitution of India \u2013 Suo moto exercise of jurisdiction u/Art.136:Held: The testimony of PW-25 and PW-26 was rejected \u2013 Consequent to which, accused nos.1, 5 and 13 were acquitted \u2013 The case of accused nos. 3 and 4 stands on the same footing as accused nos. 1,5 and 13 \u2013 They must get the benefi t of parity \u2013 Accused nos.3 and 4 did not prefer any appeal \u2013 In the case of Pawan Kumar v. State of Haryana, Supreme Court dealt with similar contingency in some detail \u2013 The Court held that the jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of India can be invoked in favour of the party even suo moto when the Court is satisfi ed that compelling ground for its exercise exists \u2013 However, such suo moto power should be used very sparingly with caution and circumspection \u2013 The Court held that the power must be exercised in the rarest of the rare cases. [Para 16]Practice and Procedure:Held: Earlier special leave petition fi led by accused no.2 was summarily dismissed without recording any reasons \u2013 The law is well-settled that an order refusing special leave to appeal by a non-speaking order does not attract the doctrine of merger \u2013 The case of accused no 2 stands on the same footing as accused nos. 1,5 and 13 acquitted by this Court \u2013 The accused no.2 must get the benefi t of parity \u2013 Therefore, the order passed in the earlier special leave petition fi led by accused no.2 is recalled.

Service Law \u2013 Claim for absorption as an Assistant Teacher in the Higher Secondary section \u2013 Tenable or not:Held: The appellant was appointed as a substitute teacher in the payscale of a primary teacher \u2013 When he fi led the fi rst round of proceedings in O.A. No. 209 of 1991, no plea was raised that he worked as an Assistant Teacher in the Higher Secondary Section \u2013 Before the Tribunal, the argument was only about regularization \u2013 The Screening Committee having considered him, pursuant to the orders of the Supreme Court, has thought it fi t to absorb him only as a primary teacher; the Screening Committee itself was pursuant to the orders of the Supreme Court and based on the Master Circular of 29.01.1991 wherein the claims of the candidates like the appellant were examined; the records of his appointment as a substitute teacher admittedly showed that he was only appointed as a substitute primary teacher \u2013 Also, in the earlier round of proceedings culminating in the order of the Supreme Court dated 15.02.1996, this issue was never raised \u2013 His claim for absorption as an assistant teacher in the Higher Secondary Section is clearly barred by constructive res judicata \u2013 Thus, the appellant\u2019s claim for absorption as Assistant Teacher in the Higher Secondary Section is not tenable.

Jayasree Deb Roy (Dutta), by abundant caution, the Master Circular was referred to and the rights granted therein were reiterated expressly \u2013 The appellant being identically situated with the other absorbees in the order of 02.01.1998 could not have been discriminated and denied the benefit of his service from 04.03.1990 to the date of his absorption \u2013 The Tribunal and the High Court have grossly erred in denying the relief by wrongly understanding the orders of the Supreme Court and the legal position \u2013 Thus, the appellant should be extended the same benefits as were extended to others, who were granted continuity by the letter of 28.12.1998.

Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih:Held: It is the stand of the appellants \u2013 State of West Bengal, that they are owners of 20.87 acres of the land in question and to this extent, they have no diffi culty in executing the mining lease \u2013 This being the stated stand, which has also been affi rmed, there should be no diffi culty in granting of mining lease for the said area to the Respondent No. 1-M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih \u2013 So, it is directed that the government of West Bengal will execute a mining lease for 20.87 acres of land in favour of the Respondent No. 1 \u2013 The claim of the Respondent No. 1 towards the balance area for the grant of mining lease will be treated as rejected and dismissed. [Paras 20 and 22]Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013sub-section (1) to Section 10-A Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 \u2013 Object and purpose of amendment \u2013 Application of exceptions or the saving clauses in three kinds of situations:Held: The object and purpose of the Amendment Act, 2015 is to ensure that allocation of mineral resources is done through auctioning \u2013 This is the reason why sub-section (1) to Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957 mandates that all applications received prior to 12.01.2015 shall become ineligible \u2013 The exceptions or the saving clause applies to three kinds of situations specifi ed in sub-section (2) to Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957 \u2013 The fi rst category is where an application has been received u/s. 11-A of the MMDR Act,1957 \u2013 The second category is where a reconnaissance permit or a prospecting licence has been granted the permit holder or the licensee has the right to obtain a prospecting licence followed by a mining lease and the State Government is satisfi ed that the permit holder or the licensee has complied with the requirements specifi ed in sub-clauses (i) to (iv) of clause (b) of sub-section (2) to Section 10-A of the MMDR Act, 1957 \u2013 The reason for protecting this class of cases is on account of the fact that they had altered their position by spending money on reconnaissance operations or prospecting operations \u2013 Accordingly, the principle of legitimate expectation is applied \u2013 The third category is where the Central Government had already communicated their previous approval or the State Government had issue Letter of Intent for grant of mining lease before coming into force of the Amendment Act 2015 \u2013 The raison d\u00eatre, it is observed therein, is that certain rights had accrued to these applicants inasmuch as all necessary procedures and formalities had been complied with and only formal lease remains to be executed. [Para 14]Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015 \u2013 A Grant Order dated 16.07.2015 was issued by the Deputy Secretary, Commerce and Industries Department, West Bengal for Dolomite mining in favour of Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih in respect of 76 acres of land, subject to certain conditions \u2013 Whether approval of the Central Government required or not: Held: Though in the present case, post notifi cation No. S.O. 423(E) dated 10.02.2015, Dolomite was notifi ed as a minor mineral and hence, the approval of the Central Government was not required for the reason that the Grant Order dated 16.07.2015 was hedged with pre-conditions, including the requirement to submit consent letters of the owners of the land in question (Raiyats) before the execution of the lease deed, or there was to be a stipulation that a condition to this eff ect would be incorporated in the draft lease \u2013 Therefore, the Grant Order dated 16.07.2015 is provisional, and is subject to fulfi lment of the conditions therein. [Para 16]West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 \u2013 sub-section (10) to section 2 and sub-section (2A) to section 4 \u2013 Raiyat Land \u2013 Meaning \u2013 Rights of Raiyat in respect of land:Held: Raiyat land is to be used for cultivation, etc., and not for mining \u2013 Once the mining activity is undertaken, the Raiyats will not be able to use the land \u2013 In terms of sub-section (10) to Section 2 of the WBLR Act, 1955, a Raiyat means a person or an institution holding land for any purpose whatsoever \u2013 However, the rights of Raiyat in respect of the land in terms of sub-section (2A) to Section 4 of the WBLR Act, 1955 does not permit any other person to quarry sand from his holding, dig or use, or permit any person to dig or use, earth or clay of his holding for the manufacture of bricks or tiles except with previous permission in writing of the State Government \u2013 In case of breach of the condition, the prescribed authority may, after giving notice and opportunity to a Raiyat to show cause, can levy a monetary penalty. [Para 17]West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 \u2013 s. 4B \u2013 Preservation of character of land:Held: Section 4-B of the WBLR Act, 1955 stipulates that every Raiyat holding any land shall maintain and preserve such land in a manner that the area is not diminished or its character is not changed or the land is not converted for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was settled or previously held except with the previous permission of the Collector in writing. [Para 17]Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013 West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1955 \u2013 s. 14 Y \u2013 A Grant Order dated 16.07.2015 was issued by the Deputy Secretary, Commerce and Industries Department, West Bengal for Dolomite mining in favour of Respondent No. 1 - M/s. Chiranjilal (Mineral) Industries of Bagandih in respect of 76 acres of land, subject to certain conditions, including the requirement to submit consent letters of owners of the land in question (Raiyats) \u2013 Another stipulation mentioned therein was the need for permission u/s. 14-Y of the WBLR Act, 1955 for holding the required land and furnishing of Conversion Certifi cate for plots of land from the appropriate authority in terms of s.4-C of the WBLR Act, 1955:Held: The controversy relating to Section 4-C of the WBLR Act, 1955, cannot simply be decided on the basis of Memo No. V/RTI/775/15 dated 06.03.2017 issued by the Deputy District Land and Land Reforms Offi cer, Purulia, that as per the revenue records the land was recorded as \u2018Dungri\u2019 \u2013 The reason is that Raiyat land is not for mining \u2013 Thus, a contradiction arises, as the grant of Raiyat land and the classifi cation of the same land as \u2018Dungri\u2019 is contradictory \u2013 Further, whether the consent letter of the owners of the land in question (Raiyats) obtained by the Respondent No. 1still hold good, would be relevant as there could be a change of hands on account of transfer, inheritance, etc \u2013 Connected with this are the legal issues \u2013 First, whether the Respondent No. 1 had altered its position post the issue of the Grant Order dated 16.07.2015, but before enforcement of the Concession Rules, 2016, to get the benefi t of Rule 61 of the Concessions Rules, 2016? \u2013 It is necessary to ascertain the facts and then alone one can adjudicate and decide the question whether the Respondent No. 1 is entitled to the benefi t of the proviso to Rule 61 of the Concession Rules, 2016 \u2013 This has not been verifi ed and ascertained \u2013 An issue would arise on whether the application fi led by the Respondent No. 1 way back in 1998 would still hold good as at the time, when the application was fi led, approval of the Central Government was required \u2013 Another diffi culty is that WBMDTCL has not been impleaded as a party, though it was always contesting the claim made by the Respondent No. 1 \u2013 However, these issues are not being examined in the light of the directions issued \u2013 Further, that the remand order cannot be passed at this distinct point of time.

[Para 15.1]Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 s.80P(4):Held: Sub-section (4) of s.80P in the present form is in the nature of an exception which states that the provisions of s.80P shall apply in relation to any co-operative bank other than a primary agricultural credit society or a primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank \u2013 The expressions co-operative bank and primary agricultural credit society as well as primary co-operative agricultural and rural development bank are defi ned in the Explanation as co-operative bank and primary agricultural credit society having the meanings respectively assigned to them in Part V of the BR Act, 1949 \u2013 Banking Regulation Act, 1949. [Para 15.2]Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 ss.5(b), (c), 22, 56(o) \u2013 \u2018banking company\u2019 \u2013 \u2018banking\u2019:Held: Banking company in s.5(c) means any company which transacts the business of banking in India \u2013 \u201cBanking\u201d is defi ned in s.5(b) to mean the accepting, for the purpose of lending or investment, of deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or otherwise, and withdrawal by cheque, draft, order or otherwise \u2013 Therefore, a banking company must transact banking business vis-\u00e0-vis the public \u2013 Thus, in the fi rst place a co-operative society must be engaged in banking business as defi ned in s.5(b) \u2013 For that, s.22 speaks about licence to be obtained by a bank to do banking business which is modifi ed as per clause (o) of s.56 which states that no cooperative society shall carry on banking business in India unless it is a co-operative bank and holds a licence issued in that behalf by the Reserve Bank, subject to such conditions, if any, as the Reserve Bank may deem fi t to impose \u2013 Secondly, a co-operative society must obtain a licence u/s.22, only if it functions as a co-operative bank and not otherwise \u2013 Thus, a co-operative society including a co-operative credit society which is not a co-operative bank does not require a licence to function as such. [Para 15.4]Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 ss.5(b), 56(c)(i)(cci):Held: If a co-operative society is not conducting the business ofbanking as defi ned in clause (b) of s.5, BR Act, 1949, it would not be a co-operative bank and not so within the meanings of a state co-operative bank, a central co-operative bank or a primary co-operative bank in terms of s.56(c)(i)(cci) \u2013 Whereas a co-operative bank is in the nature of a banking company which transacts the business of banking as defi ned in clause (b) of s.5 of the BR Act, 1949 \u2013 National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Act, 1981 \u2013 ss.2(d), (u), (v)-(x). [Para 15.8]Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 s.80P(4) \u2013 Object and purpose \u2013 Discussed. Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 s.56 \u2013 Object: Held: Having regard to the Explanation to sub-section (4) of s.80P, it is necessary to consider Chapter V of the BR Act, 1949 which states that the said Act shall apply to co-operative societies subject to modifi cations made thereunder \u2013 s.56 begins with a non-obstante clause which states that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions of the said Act, shall apply to, or in relation to, co-operative societies as they apply to, or in relation to, banking companies subject to certain modifi cations \u2013 The object of s.56 is to provide a deeming fi ction by equating a co-operative society to a banking company if it is a co-operative bank within the meaning of the said provision \u2013 This is because Chapter V of the BR Act, 1949, deals with application of the Chapter to co-operative societies which are co-operative banks within the meaning of the said chapter \u2013 For the purpose of these cases, what is relevant is that throughout the BR Act, 1949, unless the context otherwise requires, references to a \u201cbanking company\u201d or \u201cthe company\u201d or \u201csuch company\u201d shall be construed as references to a co-operative bank \u2013 Therefore, while considering the meaning of a co-operative bank inherently, such a cooperative society must be a banking company then only it would be construed as a co-operative bank requiring a licence u/s.22 of BR Act, 1949 in order to function as such a bank \u2013 Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 s.80P(4). [Paras 15.4 and 15.9]Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 s.56 \u2013 \u2018co-operative bank\u2019 \u2013 National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Act, 1981 \u2013 s.2(u) \u2013 Banking Regulation Act, 1949 \u2013 ss.2(c), and 22:Held: When the defi nition of \u201cco-operative bank\u201d in s.56 of BR Act, 1949 is viewed in terms of s.2(u) of the NABARD Act, 1981, it is clear that only a state co-operative bank would be within the scope and meaning of a banking company u/s.2(c) of the BR Act, 1949 on obtaining licence u/s.22 of the said Act.

[Paras 26 and 31]Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s. 307 r/w. s.34 IPC \u2013 Conviction under:Held: Evidence is that the appellants were with the main accused, exhorting him not to spare rival faction\u2019s supporters, and pointing at targets \u2013 Though, evidence might not be specifi c as to who in particular was targeted at the behest of the appellants but the very fact that indiscriminate fi ring continued for long, say 20-25 minutes and the appellants were found present and exhorting main accused to fi re, it could be said with certainty that the appellants had knowledge that the act which the main accused was exhorted to commit was so imminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death of a person (Section 300 (Fourthly) of the I.P.C along with illustration (d) thereto) \u2013 Therefore, the gunshots fi red by the main accused at several by-standers/supporters of rival faction, if not all, could be said to be a criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all \u2013 The appellants are liable to be convicted for the off ence punishable u/s. 307 with the aid of s.34 of the IPC [Paras 32 and 33]Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s. 34 \u2013 Common intention \u2013 Necessity:Held: To fasten liability with the aid of s.34 of the IPC what must necessarily be proved is a common intention to commit the crime actually committed and each accused person can be convicted of that crime, only if it is in furtherance of common intention of all \u2013 Common intention pre-supposes a prior concert, though pre-concert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary as common intention to bring about a particular result may develop on the spot \u2013 The question whether there was any common intention or not depends upon the inference to be drawn from the proven facts and circumstances of each case \u2013 The totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had a common intention to commit an off ence with which they could be convicted. [Para 29]Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 \u2013 Effect of not putting the incriminating circumstance of exhortation to the appellants while recording their statements u/s. 313 of the Cr.PC, 1973:Held: The legal position that emerges, inter-alia, is that to enable an accused to explain the circumstances appearing in the evidence against him, all the incriminating circumstances appearing against him in the evidence must be put to him \u2013 But where there has been a failure in putting those circumstances to the accused, the same would not ipso facto vitiate the trial unless it is shown that its non-compliance has prejudiced the accused \u2013 Where there is a delay in raising the plea, or the plea is raised for the fi rst time in this Court, it could be assumed that no prejudice had been felt by the accused \u2013 In the instant case, appellants were aware of the prosecution case against them as they were apprised of the FIR lodged by PW-2 which delineated their role as the ones who exhorted the main accused to fi re gunshots \u2013 Taking the above into account as also that the appellants were throughout represented by their counsel and had cross-examined the prosecution witnesses, yet they raised no such plea, either before the trial court or the High Court, it can safely be assumed that the appellants had suff ered no prejudice on that count.

[Para 28]Remission \u2013 Remission policy \u2013 Application of: Held: Remission policy prevailing on the date of conviction, is to be applied in a given case, and if a more liberal policy exists on the day of consideration, then the latter would apply.

Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Appellant-accused had attacked the victim\u0002deceased with sharp-edged weapon causing his death \u2013 Appellant pleaded insanity: Held: During preliminary examination, CW-1-doctor categorically deposed that going by the case history of the accused prepared by the Hospital, appellant had earlier been treated for acute and transient psychotic disorder \u2013 As per the opinion of this witness, the appellant\u0002accused seemed to have major depressive disorder with psychotic feature \u2013 On examination, the appellant-accused was found to have partially impaired judgment due to perceptive auditory hallucinations \u2013 The medicines prescribed were for the accused\u2019s psychiatric ailments and the ailment was relapse able and there is every chance of attack anytime \u2013 Apart from the above medical evidence, the abnormal/insane behaviour of the appellant-accused at the time of the assault \u2013 In her cross-examination, PW-13 admits that accused-appellant even told her that he did not know as to what he had done to his grandfather/deceased \u2013 The other villagers who reached at the spot soon after the incident have stated that when they arrived at the spot the appellant-accused was present and was not trying to fl ee from there \u2013 This behaviour of the appellant-accused was not of a normal person \u2013 Also, when the appellant-accused was arrested, PW- 14 medically examined him and found that he appeared to be clinically under the infl uence of some psychotropic substance \u2013 It is also to be seen that after the appellant-accused attacked the deceased by a sharp-edged weapon which was later snatched by PW-1, he was trying to take out the windpipe from the neck of the deceased which was already cut \u2013 This action of the appellant-accused was weird and abnormal \u2013 This is clearly indicative of the fact that he was suff ering from insanity at the time of incident \u2013 Therefore, the High Court erred in setting aside the judgment of acquittal rendered by the Trial Court. [Paras 16, 17 and 18] Appeal \u2013 Appellate Court \u2013 Reversal of acquittal: Held: It is settled that the judgment of acquittal can be reversed by the Appellate Court only when there is perversity and not by taking a diff erent view on reappreciation of evidence \u2013 If the conclusion of the Trial Court is plausible one, merely because another view is possible on reappreciation of evidence, the Appellate Court should not disturb the fi ndings of acquittal and substitute its own fi ndings to convict the accused.

Income Tax \u2013 DTAA and Omani Tax Laws \u2013 Benefit to the assessee under: Held: A clarification letter dated 11.12.2000 (interpreting the provisions contained in Article 8 and Article 8 (bis) of the Omani Tax Laws) addressed by the Secretary General for Taxation, Sultanate of Oman, Ministry of Finance was issued which stated the dividend distributed by all companies, including the tax-exempt companies would be exempt from payment of income tax in the hands of the recipients \u2013 By extending the facility of exemption, the Government of Oman intended to achieve its object of promoting development within Oman by attracting investments \u2013 Since the assessee has invested in the project by setting up a permanent establishment in Oman, as the JV is registered as a separate company under the Omani laws, it is aiding to promote economic development within Oman and achieve the object of Article 8 (bis) \u2013 A plain reading of Article 8 and Article 8 (bis) would manifest that under Article 8, dividend is taxable, whereas, Article 8(bis) exempts dividend received by a company from its ownership  of shares, portions, or shareholding in the share capital in any other company \u2013 Thus, Article 8(bis) exempts dividend tax received by the assessee from its PE in Oman and by virtue of Article 25, the assessee is entitled to the same tax treatment in India as it received in Oman \u2013 Insofar as the argument concerning the assessee not having PE in Oman is concerned, it is apparent that the assessee\u2019s establishment in Oman has been treated as PE from the very inception up to the year 2011 \u2013 There is no reason as to why all of a sudden, the assessee\u2019s establishment in Oman would not be treated as PE when for about 10 years it was so treated, and tax exemption was granted basing upon the provisions contained in Article 25 read with Article 8 (bis) of the Omani Tax Laws \u2013 Thus, appellant has not been able to demonstrate as to why the provisions contained in Article 25 of DTAA and Article 8 (bis) of the Omani Tax Laws would not be applicable.

        "HeadNote": "Issue for consideration: Whether the arrest of the appellants u/s. 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 was valid; whether there was proper compliance with s.19(1) of the Act of 2002 and as to whether the Vacation Judge/Additional Sessions Judge correctly considered that issue while passing the remand orders; what is the importance of informing the arrested person of the grounds for his/her arrest. Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Compliance of s.19 of the Act \u2013 Proper or not: Held: The remand order dated 15.06.2023 passed by the Vacation Judge/Additional Sessions Judge reflects total failure on his part in discharging his duty as per the expected standard \u2013 The Judge did not even record a fi nding that he perused the grounds of arrest to ascertain whether the ED had recorded reasons to believe that the appellants were guilty of an off ence under the Act of 2002 and that there was proper compliance with the mandate of s.19 of the Act of 2002 \u2013 He merely stated that, keeping in view the seriousness of the off ences and the stage of the investigation, he was convinced that custodial interrogation of the accused persons was required in the present case and remanded them to the custody of the ED \u2013 Analyzing the arrest of the appellants, neither of the appellants was shown as accused in the fi rst ECIR registered by the ED \u2013 Both the appellants secured interim protection by way of anticipatory bail from the High Court \u2013 However, both the appellants were summoned on 14.06.2023 for interrogation in connection with the fi rst ECIR and summons were served on 13.06.2023 \u2013 Signifi cantly, second ECIR was recorded on 13.06.2023 in connection with FIR No.0006 which was registered on 17.04.2023 \u2013 Therein also, neither of the appellants were shown as accused and only one \u2018RB\u2019 was shown as accused \u2013 Both appellants had presented themselves at the ED\u2019s offi ce \u2013 Thereafter, both appellants were arrested in connection with the second ECIR, were in exercise of power u/s. 19(1) of the Act of 2002 \u2013 It was alleged that both appellants failed to respond to the questions put by ED \u2013 Mere non-cooperation of a witness in response to the summons issued u/s. 50 of the Act of 2002 would not be enough to render him/her liable to be arrested u/s. 19 \u2013 In any event, it is not open to the ED to expect an admission of guilt from the person summoned for interrogation and assert that anything short of such admission would be an \u2018evasive reply\u2019 \u2013 Also, it is the admitted position is that the ED\u2019s Investigating Offi cer merely read out or permitted reading of the grounds of arrest of the appellants and left it at that, which is also disputed by the appellants \u2013 As this form of communication is not found to be adequate to fulfi l compliance with the mandate of Art. 22(1) of the Constitution and s.19(1) of the Act of 2002 \u2013 Thus, there is no hesitation in holding that their arrest was not in keeping with the provisions of s.19(1) of the Act of 2002. [Paras 18, 19, 25, 35] Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 22 \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Informing the arrested person of the grounds for his/her arrest \u2013 Importance of: Held: Article 22(1) of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest \u2013 It may be noted that s.45 of the Act of 2002 enables the person arrested u/s. 19 thereof to seek release on bail but it postulates that unless the twin conditions prescribed thereunder are satisfi ed, such a person would not be entitled to grant of bail \u2013 The twin conditions set out in the provision are that, fi rstly, the Court must be satisfi ed, after giving an opportunity to the public prosecutor to oppose the application for release, that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the arrested person is not guilty of the off ence and, secondly, that he is not likely to commit any off ence while on bail \u2013 To meet this requirement, it would be essential for the arrested person to be aware of the grounds on which the authorized offi cer arrested him/her u/s.19 and the basis for the offi cer\u2019s \u2018reason to believe\u2019 that he/she is guilty of an off ence punishable under the Act of 2002 \u2013 It is only if the arrested person has knowledge of these facts that he/she would be in a position to plead and prove before the Special Court that there are grounds to believe that he/she is not guilty of such off ence, so as to avail the relief of bail \u2013 Therefore, communication of the grounds of arrest, as mandated by Art. 22(1) of the Constitution and s.19 of the Act of 2002, is meant to serve this higher purpose and must be given due importance. [Para 29] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Furnishing the written grounds of arrest to arrested person: Held: There is no valid reason as to why a copy of such written grounds of arrest should not be furnished to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception \u2013 There are two primary reasons as to why this would be the advisable course of action to be followed as a matter of principle \u2013 Firstly, in the event such grounds of arrest are orally read out to the arrested person or read by such person with nothing further and this fact is disputed in a given case, it may boil down to the word of the arrested person against the word of the authorized offi cer as to whether or not there is due and proper compliance in this regard \u2013 Such a precarious situation is easily avoided and the consequence thereof can be obviated very simply by furnishing the written grounds of arrest, as recorded by the authorized offi cer in terms of s.19(1) of the Act of 2002, to the arrested person under due acknowledgment, instead of leaving it to the debatable ipse dixit of the authorized offi cer \u2013 Secondly, conveyance of this information is not only to apprise the arrested person of why he/she is being arrested but also to enable such person to seek legal counsel and, thereafter, present a case before the Court u/s. 45 to seek release on bail, if he/she so chooses. [Paras 32, 33] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Non-compliance of mandate under Art.22 of Constitution and s.19 of the 2002 Act \u2013 Arbitrary exercise of power by ED: Held: In the case on hand, the admitted position is that the ED\u2019s Investigating Offi cer merely read out or permitted reading of the grounds of arrest of the appellants and left it at that, which is also disputed by the appellants \u2013 As this form of communication is not found to be adequate to fulfi l compliance with the mandate of Art. 22(1) of the Constitution and s.19(1) of the Act of 2002, there is no hesitation in holding that their arrest was not in keeping with the provisions of s.19(1) of the Act of 2002 \u2013 Further, the clandestine conduct of the ED in proceeding against the appellants, by recording the second ECIR immediately after they secured interim protection in relation to the fi rst ECIR, does not commend acceptance as it reeks of arbitrary exercise of power \u2013 In eff ect, the arrest of the appellants and, in consequence, their remand to the custody of the ED and, thereafter, to judicial custody, cannot be sustained.

Service Law \u2013 Departmental proceedings pending criminal trial arising from the same transactions, if to be stayed \u2013 Acquittal in one of the proceedings if entails an acquittal in the other: Held: Clause 4 of the MoS does not envisage a complete standstill of departmental proceedings as a result of the pendency of criminal proceedings \u2013 It may be desirable or, in certain circumstances, advisable for disciplinary proceedings to be stayed when criminal proceedings are ongoing however, stay is not \"a matter of course\" and is only to be given after consideration of all factors, for and against \u2013 Departmental proceedings cannot be unduly and unjustly delayed \u2013 It is only after the completion of the entire process of disciplinary proceedings that the respondent relying upon clause 4 of the MoS fi led writ petition challenging the action, which was a belated attempt only to forestall its implementation \u2013 Further, completion of trial must be construed as completion \u201cwithin the reasonable time frame\u201d and the clause cannot come to the aid of the employee \u201cmore so\u201d, for \u201cprolongation on the trial\u201d \u2013 In the instant case, the completion of the trial concerning the crime registered in the year 1996 is nowhere nearing completion \u2013 On facts, no plea of MoS was ever taken \u2013 No specifi c plea of postponement of disciplinary proceedings awaiting conclusion of a criminal trial was made \u2013 Neither was it the case that the trial to which the respondent was subjected to begin within one year of the commission of the off ence nor does the record speak to this eff ect \u2013 It is not mandatory to stay the disciplinary proceedings particularly when they were initiated after the prescribed period of one year \u2013 The restriction within clause 4 is not complete and is to be applied on facts \u2013 Furthermore, the nature of proceedings being wholly separate and distinct, acquittal in criminal proceedings does not entitle the delinquent employee for any benefi t in the latter or automatic discharge in departmental proceedings and would also not tantamount to closure or culmination of proceedings in favour of the delinquent employee \u2013 Impugned judgment set aside \u2013 Respondent\u2019s dismissal from service restored.

[Paras 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14] Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Dowry death \u2013 High Court partly allowed the appeal fi led by the accused persons; accused no.1, father of the appellant herein was acquitted of the charge u/s. 304-B of the IPC, however, the conviction and sentence qua appellant was upheld \u2013 Propriety: Held: Dying declaration of deceased was not free from doubt \u2013 The most glaring aspect that is required to be considered is that the High Court itself has disbelieved the dying declaration insofar as father-in-law of the deceased is concerned \u2013 It is diffi cult to understand that how the same dying declaration could have been made basis for conviction of the appellant when the same was disbelieved insofar as another accused is concerned \u2013 PW-9-investigating offi cer had stated in his deposition that he had come to the conclusion that the present case was not a case u/s. 307 of IPC or s.498-A of IPC but a case u/s. 309 of IPC \u2013 He had further stated that during investigation, it was revealed that the deceased was short-tempered and that accused no.1 (father of appellant) was not there in the village on the fateful day \u2013 Insofar as harassment with regard to non-fulfi llment of demand of dowry is concerned, except the vague allegation, there is nothing in their evidence to support the prosecution case \u2013 PW-6-Sarpanch of the village stated that he was informed by PW-4, father of the deceased that in-laws of the deceased were harassing her and therefore they should go to village, however, nothing was said regarding any harassment on account of non-fulfi llment of demand of dowry \u2013 There is no evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was harassed on account of non-fulfi llment of demand of dowry \u2013 Therefore, no case u/s. 304-B of IPC is made out by the prosecution.

Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.302, s.498A \u2013 Prosecution case was that victim died due to poisoning \u2013 At the time of death only her appellant-husband was present \u2013 Poison was found in the examination of viscera of the deceased \u2013 Appellant-husband had not informed family of victim after her death \u2013 Earlier, victim-deceased had written letters to her family informing them regarding harassment from her appellant-husband and appellant-mother-in-law for dowry: Held: The cause of death was due to poisoning \u2013 The poison detected in the viscera was aluminium phosphide, which is used a fumigant to control the insects and rodents \u2013 Defense of the convicts to say that the presence of aluminium phosphide in the viscera could be due to the medicines which the deceased used to take for her heart ailment cannot be accepted \u2013 No evidence led by the appellant-husband that he had taken victim to the hospital in Delhi \u2013 The dubious conduct of the convict-husband of not informing the family members about the death of their daughter \u2013 In the case on hand it has been established or rather proved to the satisfaction of the court that the deceased was in company of her husband i.e., the appellant-convict at a point of time when something went wrong with her health and therefore, in such circumstances the appellant-convict alone knew what happened to her until she was with him \u2013 Appellant-convict (husband) has not explained in any manner as to what had actually happened to his wife more particularly when it is not in dispute that the appellant-convict was in company of his wife i.e., deceased \u2013 Although, the appellant-convict tried to project a picture that no sooner the deceased fell sick than he immediately took her to the Hospital at Delhi \u2013 If it is his case, that his wife was declared dead on being brought at the hospital then it is diffi cult to believe that the hospital authorities allowed the appellant to carry the dead body back home without completing the legal formalities \u2013 The circumstances in the instant case constitute more than a prima facie case to enable the prosecution to invoke s.106 of the Evidence Act and shift the burden on the accused husband to explain what had actually happened on the date his wife died \u2013 Section 106 does not cast any burden upon an accused in a criminal trial, but that, where the accused throws no light at all upon the facts which ought to be especially within his knowledge, and which could support any theory of hypothesis compatible with his innocence, the Court can also consider his failure to adduce any explanation, in consonance with the principle of the passage in Deonandan Mishra \u2013 The courts would deal with such cases in a more realistic manner and not allow the criminals to escape on account of procedural technicalities, perfunctory investigation or insignifi cant lacunas in the evidence \u2013 In result, both the appeals fail. [Paras 29,52,53,56,61 and 62] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.106 \u2013 Applicability \u2013 Meaning of word \u201cespecially\u201d: Held: s.106 of the Evidence Act provides that when any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him \u2013 The word \u201cespecially\u201d means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within the knowledge of the accused \u2013 The ordinary rule that applies to the criminal trials that the onus lies on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused is not in any way modifi ed by the rule of facts embodied in s.106 of the Evidence Act \u2013 s.106 of the Evidence Act is an exception to s.101 of the Evidence Act. [Para 34] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.106 does not absolve the prosecution from duty of proving crime: Held: Section 106 cannot be invoked to make up the inability of the prosecution to produce evidence of circumstances pointing to the guilt of the accused \u2013 This section cannot be used to support a conviction unless the prosecution has discharged the onus by proving all the elements necessary to establish the off ence \u2013 It does not absolve the prosecution from the duty of proving that a crime was committed even though it is a matter specifi cally within the knowledge of the accused and it does not throw the burden of the accused to show that no crime was committed. [Para 42] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.106 \u2013 Distinction exists between the burden of proof and the burden of going forward with the evidence: Held: Generally, the burden of proof upon any affi rmative proposition necessary to be established as the foundation of an issue does not shift, but the burden of evidence or the burden of explanation may shift from one side to the other according to the testimony \u2013 Thus, if the prosecution has off ered evidence which if believed by the court would convince them of the accused's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is in a position where he should go forward with counter-vailing evidence if he has such evidence \u2013 When facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, the burden is on him to present evidence of such facts, whether the proposition is an affi rmative or negative one \u2013 He is not required to do so even though a prima facie case has been established, for the court must still fi nd that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before it can convict \u2013 However, the accused's failure to present evidence on his behalf may be regarded by the court as confi rming the conclusion indicated by the evidence presented by the prosecution or as confi rming presumptions which might have been rebutted. [Para 46] Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.106 \u2013 \u201cPrima facie\u201d in context of s.106: Held: Section 106 of the Evidence Act would apply to cases where the prosecution could be said to have succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference can be drawn regarding death.

Constitution of India \u2013 Writ of Habeus Corpus \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Respondent-Authority invoked s.19 of the PMLA, 2002 and appellant was arrested on 14.06.2023 \u2013 Writ of Habeus corpus fi led \u2013 Meanwhile, respondent fi led an application before the Principal Sessions Judge seeking judicial custody for 15 days \u2013 Order of remand passed: Held: A writ of Habeas Corpus shall only be issued when the detention is illegal \u2013 As a matter of rule, an order of remand by a judicial offi cer, culminating into a judicial function cannot be challenged by way of a writ of Habeas Corpus, while it is open to the person aggrieved to seek other statutory remedies \u2013 When an arrestee is forwarded to the jurisdictional Magistrate under Section 19(3) of the PMLA, 2002 no writ of Habeus Corpus  would lie \u2013 Any plea of illegal arrest is to be made before such Magistrate since custody becomes judicial \u2013 An order of remand has to be challenged only before a higher forum as provided under the CrPC, 1973 when it depicts a due application of mind both on merit and compliance of Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 read with Section 19 of the PMLA 2002 \u2013 In the instant case, when writ of Habeus Corpus was taken up for hearing on a mentioning, the appellant was duly produced before the Principal Sessions Judge in compliance with Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 \u2013 The custody thus becomes judicial as he was duly forwarded by the respondents \u2013 Therefore, even on the date of hearing before the High Court there was no cause for fi ling the Writ Petition \u2013 Added to that, an order of remand was passed on 14.06.2023 itself \u2013 The two remand orders passed by the Court, depicted a clear application of mind \u2013 Despite additional grounds having been raised, they being an afterthought, there is no hesitation in holding that the only remedy open to the appellant is to approach the appropriate Court under the Statute \u2013 Also, as the arrest and custody were already upheld by way of rejection of the bail application \u2013 Therefore, even on that ground it is held that a writ of Habeas Corpus is not maintainable. [Paras 29, 81 and 88] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Application of s.41A CrPC to an arrest made under the PMLA 2002: Held: An Authorized Offi cer under the PMLA, 2002 is not duty bound to follow the rigor of Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 as against the binding conditions under Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 \u2013 As there is already an exhaustive procedure contemplated under the PMLA, 2002 containing suffi cient safeguards in favour of the person arrested, Section 41A of the CrPC, 1973 has no application at all. [Para 35] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 To eff ect an arrest under the Act: Held: To eff ect an arrest, an offi cer authorised has to assess and evaluate the materials in his possession \u2013 Through such materials, he is expected to form a reason to believe that a person has been guilty of an off ence punishable under the PMLA, 2002 \u2013 Thereafter, he is at liberty to arrest, while performing his mandatory duty of recording the reasons \u2013 The said exercise has to be followed by way of an information being served on the arrestee of the grounds of arrest \u2013 Any non-compliance of the mandate of Section 19(1) of the PMLA, 2002 would vitiate the very arrest itself \u2013 Under sub-section (2), the Authorised Offi cer shall immediately, after the arrest, forward a copy of the order as mandated under sub-section (1) together with the materials in his custody, forming the basis of his belief, to the Adjudicating Authority, in a sealed envelope \u2013 Thereafter, the arrestee has to be taken to the Special Court, or the Judicial Magistrate or the Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, having the jurisdiction within 24 hours of such arrest. [Paras 39 and 40] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Non-compliance of s.19 of the Act: Held: S.62 of the PMLA, 2002 is a reiteration of the mandatory compliance of Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 \u2013 It is in the nature of a warning to an offi cer concerned to strictly comply with the mandate of Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 in letter and spirit failing which he would be visited with the consequences \u2013 It is his bounden duty to record the reasons for his belief in coming to conclusion that a person has been guilty and therefore, to be arrested \u2013 Any non-compliance of the mandate of Section 19 of the PMLA, 2002 would enure to the benefi t of the person arrested \u2013 For such non-compliance, the Competent Court shall have the power to initiate action under Section 62 of the PMLA, 2002. [Paras 42 and 88] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013The PMLA, 2002 shall have precedence: Held: A conjoint reading of Section 65 of the PMLA, 2002 along with Sections 4 and 5 of the CrPC, 1973 leaves no room for doubt on the precedence of the former over the latter when it comes to investigation. [Para 45] Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Inquiry and investigation: Held: For an inquiry and investigation there can be same materials, while there is no bar for reliance on additional ones \u2013 They can travel in the same channel, but their destinations are diff erent \u2013 One material can be used for both purposes, along with numerous others \u2013 So long as they travel together, there is not much of a diff erence between an inquiry and investigation \u2013 When they take separate routes, an inquiry ends before the Adjudicating Authority, while the other leads to a Special Court in the form of a complaint. [Para 46] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Detention and custody: Held: Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 authorises the detention of the accused in custody by an order of the Magistrate \u2013 It does consciously treat a detention diff erent from custody \u2013 Custody will be either to the court or an investigating agency \u2013 Detention is normally made only by an investigating agency prior to the production before the Magistrate \u2013 A custody from being judicial may turn into police through an order passed by the Magistrate \u2013 Detention may at best be a facet of custody \u2013 However, they are not synonymous with each other \u2013 When detention is authorised, it would become custody. [Para 57] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013 Interplay between s.19 of PMLA, 2002 and s.167 of the CrPC: Held: A Magistrate has a distinct role to play when a remand is made of an accused person to an authority under the PMLA, 2002 \u2013 It is his bounden duty to see to it that s.19 of the PMLA, 2002 is duly complied with and any failure would entitle the arrestee to get released \u2013 The Magistrate shall also peruse the order passed by the authority u/s. 19(1) of the PMLA, 2002 \u2013 S.167 of the CrPC, 1973 is also meant to give eff ect to s.19 of the PMLA, 2002 and therefore it is for the Magistrate to satisfy himself of its due compliance \u2013 The interplay between Section 19(1) of the PMLA, 2002 and Section 167 of the CrPC, 1973, would facilitate the application of the latter after the conclusion of the former \u2013 One cannot say that Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 is applicable to an authority when it comes to arrest but not to custody. [Paras 68 and 69] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.167 \u2013 Curtailment of 15 days of police custody by any extraneous circumstances: Held: Curtailment of 15 days of police custody by any extraneous circumstances, act of God, an order of Court not being the handy work of investigating agency would not act as a restriction. [Para 88] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Sub-section (2) of s.167 \u2013 Words \u201csuch custody\u201d: Held: The words \u201csuch custody\u201d occurring in Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 would include not only a police custody but also that of other investigating agencies \u2013 The word \u201ccustody\u201d under Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 shall mean actual custody. [Para 88] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Sub-section (2) of s.167 \u2013 Reference to the words \u201ca term not exceeding 15 days in the whole\u201d: Held: Sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the CrPC, 1973 further makes a reference to the words \u201ca term not exceeding 15 days in the whole\u201d\u2013 The term has been introduced on purpose keeping in view the proviso which gives an outer limit for the conclusion of the investigation \u2013 Similarly, the words \u201cnot exceeding 15 days in the whole\u201d should be understood in the very same manner \u2013 The word \u201cwhole\u201d means \u201ctotal, not divided, lacking no part, entire, full, and complete\u201d \u2013 The maximum period of 15 days of police custody is meant to be applied to the entire period of investigation \u2013 60 or 90 days, as a whole. [Paras 56 and 88] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Does s.167(2) CrPC restrict a police custody only to the fi rst 15 days of remand \u2013 Matter referred to Larger Bench: Held: The Registry is directed to place the matter before Hon\u2019ble the Chief Justice of India for appropriate orders to decide the larger issue of the actual import of Section 167(2) of the CrPC, 1973 as to whether the 15 days period of custody in favour of the police should be only within the fi rst 15 days of remand or spanning over the entire period of investigation \u2013 60 or 90 days, as the case may be, as a whole.

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.197 \u2013 When not attracted: Held: Although a person working in a Nationalised Bank is a public servant, yet the provisions of s.197 would not be attracted at all as s.197 is attracted only in cases where the public servant is such who is not removable from his service save by or with the sanction of the Government \u2013 Appellant, an Assistant General Manager, State Bank of India, Overseas Bank is not holding a post where he could not be removed from service except by or with the sanction of the Government \u2013 Thus, even if it is alleged that he is a public servant, still the provisions of s.197 are not attracted \u2013 Protection of s.197(1) is available only to such public servants whose appointing authority is the Central Government or the State Government and not to every public servant \u2013 Banking sector being governed by the RBI and considered as a limb of the State u/Art.12 and also by virtue of s.46A, Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the appellant is deemed to be a \u201cpublic servant\u201d under the PCAct, 1988 however, the same cannot be extended to the IPC \u2013 Further,sanction contemplated u/s.197, CrPC concerns a public servant who \u201cis accused of any off ence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his offi cial duty\u201d whereas, the off ences contemplated in the PC Act, 1988 cannot be treated as acts either directly or even purportedly done in the discharge of his offi cial duties \u2013 Off ences under the IPC and the PC Act, 1988 are diff erent and distinct \u2013 A distinction is to be drawn between an order of sanction required for prosecuting a person for commission of an off ence under the IPC and the PC Act, 1988 \u2013 Thus, although, the appellant was discharged from the off ences punishable under the PC Act, 1988 yet for the IPC off ences, he can be proceeded further in accordance with law. [Paras 41, 45, 49, 53-55 and 58] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 \u2013 s.19 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.197 \u2013 Statutory requirements \u2013 Diff erence between: Held: In the prosecution for the off ences exclusively under the PC Act, 1988, sanction is mandatory qua the public servant \u2013 In cases under the general penal law against the public servant, the necessity (or otherwise) of sanction u/s.197, CrPC depends on the factual aspects \u2013 The test in the latter case is of the \u201cnexus\u201d between the act of commission or omission and the offi cial duty of the public servant. [Para 59] Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.216 \u2013 Importance given to sanction \u2013 Discussed. [Para 44] Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 \u2013 s.19 \u2013 Sanction under, if declined on the ground that prosecution against the accused could be frivolous or vexatious, its eff ect on the trial of the IPC off ences: Held: This question is not being gone into in the present matter as sanction initially was not declined on the ground that the prosecution against the appellant was frivolous or vexatious but on the ground that what was alleged were mere procedural irregularities in discharge of essential duties \u2013 Whether such procedural irregularities constitute any off ence under the IPC or not will be looked into by the trial court \u2013 The issue highlighted may be examined by Supreme Court in some other litigation at an appropriate time. [Para 60] Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018sanction\u2019 in s.197, CrPC \u2013 Meaning: Held: In s.197, CrPC, the word \u2018sanction\u2019 has been used as a verb and, therefore, it will mean to assent, to concur or approval.

Consumer Protection \u2013 Marine Hull Insurance Policy \u2013 Non\u0002reporting of the damage/defects to the Classifi cation Society before issue of the certifi cate, class Certifi cate if rendered invalid though issued earlier \u2013 Whether the owner is to inform this aspect or whether the verifi cation by the insurer is warranted \u2013 Warranty class, if violated: Held: In the instant case, prior to the instant policy(covering the period between 09.11.2006 to 08.11.2007), the vessel was covered under a policy for the period 09.11.2005 to 08.11.2006 \u2013 During the subsistence of the earlier insurance policy, there was a damage to the engine crank shaft and connecting rods and on the recommendation for replacement, the insurer-respondent had reimbursed the amount for that purpose \u2013 Though the immediate voyage with repairs were brought to the knowledge of the insurer, the replacement was to be made in due course \u2013 No material brought on record by the appellant to indicate that the damage to the engine crank shaft which was required to be replaced and on account of which payment was obtained, was replaced or if it had not been replaced, whether it was reported to American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) so that the Classifi cation Society would have thereafter assessed as to whether even in that circumstance where the replacement had not been made, whether the repairs carried out were suffi cient to certify the seaworthiness of the vessel \u2013 On being aware, an informed decision was to be taken to issue the Class Certifi cate \u2013 Entire onus cannot be on the insurer to check as to whether subsequently the engine had been replaced by utilising the amount received \u2013 In such situation when the replacement, in fact was not made, the onus was entirely on the appellant to bring it to the notice of the Classifi cation Society and in that circumstance when the Class Certifi cate was issued, the warranty class had in fact been violated by the appellant and the exclusion as indicated would apply and make it invalid \u2013 Appellant failed to establish that the warranty class had not been breached by them and in that context the seaworthiness or otherwise at the point of accident is not of relevance \u2013 Impugned order passed by NCDRC does not call for interference \u2013 Marine Insurance Act, 1963. [Paras 18 and 24] Marine Insurance Act, 1963 \u2013 ss.35, 37, 41(5) and 55 \u2013 Warranties requirement \u2013 Rules for Building and Classing: Held: If the requirement is not complied with, then the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of breach of warranty but without prejudice to any liability incurred before that date. In a time policy, there is no implied warranty that the ship shall be seaworthy at any stage but where with the privity of the assured, the ship is sent to sea in an unseaworthy state, the insurer is not liable for any loss attributable to unseaworthiness \u2013 In view of the warranty requirement, the assured is expected to bring to the notice of the Classifi cation Society the shortcomings or the defects if any, before the issue of such Class Certifi cate since the insurance coverage to be provided by the insurer is based on such Class Certifi cate which is assumed to have been issued by the Classifi cation Society after keeping in view all aspects including the defects if any brought to their notice. [Para 16] Consumer Protection \u2013 Marine Hull Insurance Policy \u2013 Surveyor recommended rejection of the claim of the appellant \u2013 Plea of the appellant that the word of the surveyor is not fi nal: Held: Such plea would not assist the appellant \u2013 The surveyor recommended rejection of the claim mainly on the reason that the earlier defect with reference to seaworthiness was not brought to the notice of the Classifi cation Society \u2013 It is in that regard the surveyor referred to the inquiries made by him from the Classifi cation Society and indicated that the persons representing the Classifi cation Society stated that the said defi ciencies were not brought to their knowledge \u2013 Though it was contended that such indication in the surveyor\u2019s report being hearsay cannot be relied upon, in the absence of any material on behalf of the appellant to indicate that they had intimated the Classifi cation Society, there was no obligation in terms of the legal position for the insurance company to make such inquiry \u2013 Therefore, the inquiry made by the surveyor was an additional factor which was not rebutted or controverted with any other evidence by the appellant. [Para 20] Consumer Protection \u2013 Marine Hull Insurance Policy was subject to the vessel possessing a Class Warranty \u2013 Knowledge on the part of the insurer that there was breach of warranty, if amounts to a waiver: Held: Mere knowledge on the part of the insurer that there was a breach of warranty would not amount to a waiver in the absence of an express representation to that eff ect \u2013 Though during the subsistence of the insurance policy for the earlier term there was a claim lodged towards damage to the main engine of the port and crank shaft, based on the recommendation of the surveyor substantial amount had been paid, on account, to the appellant since such advancement of the amount was towards the replacement of the engine crank shaft \u2013 Except for the knowledge of the insurer that in view of the waiting period prescribed by the manufacturers for supply of the engine crank shaft for replacement, repairs were carried out and a voyage would be undertaken for urgent delivery of the cargo during the subsistence of the earlier policy period, there is nothing on record to indicate that prior to the issue of the instant insurance policy for the period 09.11.2006 to 08.11.2007 or during subsistence the replacement of the engine had been waived \u2013 Thus, when the respondent insurance company relied upon the Class Certifi cation to issue the policy there was no express or implied waiver \u2013 Appellant has not established that the defects were brought to the notice of the Classifi cation Society and thereafter the certifi cate was obtained \u2013 Thus, when it is subsequently noticed that these defects were not intimated and the warranty class had not been complied, the Classifi cation Certifi cate would automatically become invalid \u2013 In fact, the fact that the replacement of the engine crank shaft had not been made came to the knowledge of the insurer only when the fi nal surveyor report was submitted on 19.02.2007 after the policy had already been issued on 09.11.2006 and the accident had occurred on 03.12.2006 \u2013 As such there was no waiver on the part of the respondent insurer in this case.

Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 s. 2(24) \u2013 Deposit of surplus funds by the Clubs by way of bank deposits in various banks \u2013 Interest earned on the fi xed deposits, if liable to be taxed in the hands of the clubs: Held: Interest income earned on fi xed deposits made in the banks by the assessee Clubs has to be treated like any other income from other sources within the meaning of s. 2(24) and the principle of mutuality would not apply \u2013 Conversely, if any income is earned by the Clubs through its assets and resources, from persons who are not members of the Clubs, such income would also not be covered under the principle of mutuality and would be liable to be taxed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. [Para 43 (ii), (v), (vi)] Income Tax Act, 1961 \u2013 *Bangalore Club vs. Commissioner of Income Tax\u2019s case wherein it was held that the amount of interest earned by the assessee club from the banks would not fall within the ambit of the mutuality principle and would be exigible to income tax in the hands of the assessee \u2013 Reconsideration of, in view of the earlier order of this Court in **Cawnpore Club\u2019s case: Held: Reasoning given by the Coordinate Bench of this Court in *Bangalore Club\u2019s case is just and proper \u2013 It would not call for reconsideration even when viewed in light of the previous Order of this Court in **Cawnpore Club\u2019s case \u2013 Judgment in *Bangalore Club is not per incuriam although, the earlier Order passed by a Coordinate Bench of this Court in the case of **Cawnpore Club was not noticed in *Bangalore Club \u2013 Principle of mutuality would not apply to interest income earned on fi xed deposits made by the appellant Clubs in the banks irrespective whether the banks are corporate members of the club or not \u2013 Said judgment in *Bangalore Club\u2019s case holds the fi eld. [Para 5, 26-28, 39, 41 and 43 (ii), (iii), (vii)] Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 141 \u2013 Declaration of law \u2013 Binding eff ect of \u2013 **Commissioner of Income Tax vs. M/s Cawnpore Club Ltd.\u2019s case, if a binding precedent: Held: Order of this Court in **Cawnpore Club\u2019s case cannot be treated as a precedent within the meaning of Art. 141 as the said order does not declare any law \u2013 Appeals fi led by the revenue as against **Cawnpore Club were disposed of without going into the larger question as to whether **Cawnpore Club could be taxed on the interest income earned on fi xed deposits made by it in the banks, or whether the principle of mutuality would apply to the said income \u2013 There is no ratio decidendi emanating from the said order which would be a binding precedent for subsequent cases \u2013 **Cawnpore Club\u2019s case ought not to have been taken note of and considered by a Co-ordinate Bench of this Court while deciding the case of *Bangalore Club \u2013 Order passed in **Cawnpore Club binds only the parties in those appeals and cannot be understood as a precedent for subsequent cases. [Para 11, 26, 27 and 43 (i)] Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 141 \u2013 Declaration of law \u2013 Binding eff ect of \u2013 Judgment of the Karnataka High Court in ***Canara Bank\u2019s case, if a binding precedent \u2013 Held: Judgment of the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in ***Canara Bank must be restricted to apply to the facts of the said case alone though the special leave petition fi led against the said judgment was dismissed by this Court \u2013 It cannot be a precedent for subsequent cases \u2013 Judgment of another Division Bench of the said High Court in the case of *Bangalore Club was not brought to the notice of the Division Bench, which rendered the judgment in the case of ***Canara Bank \u2013 It is the judgment of the Division Bench of the said High Court in *Bangalore Club that has been sustained by a Coordinate Bench of this Court by a detailed reasoning. [Para 28 and 43 (iv)] Doctrines/ Principles \u2013 Principle of mutuality in the context of Income Tax Laws: Held: Principle of mutuality is rooted in common sense \u2013 A person cannot make a profi t from herself \u2013 This implies that a person cannot earn profi t from an association that he shares a common identity with \u2013 Essence of the principle lies in the commonality of the contributors and the participants who are also benefi ciaries \u2013 There has to be a complete identity between the contributors and the participants \u2013 Thus, it follows, that any surplus in the common fund shall not constitute income but will only be an increase in the common fund meant to meet sudden eventualities. [Para 8.1] Doctrines/ Principles \u2013 Principle of mutuality \u2013 Evolution of, in India \u2013 Discussed. [Paras 8.5 to 8.9.11] Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Principle of mutuality \u2013 Applicability of, with regard to the interest income earned on fi xed deposits made in banks/fi nancial institutions by the appellant Clubs, in the backdrop of the dictum of this Court in the case of Bangalore Club \u2013 Triple test for applying the principle of mutuality \u2013 Explained and reiterated. [Paras 31-37] Ratio decidendi \u2013 Importance and explanation of: Held: Ratio decidendi of a judgment is the reason assigned in support of the conclusion \u2013 It can be discerned only upon reading of a judgment in its entirety and the same has to be culled out thereafter \u2013 Ratio of the case has to be deduced from the facts of the case and the particular provision of law interpreted or applied by the court and the decision has to be read in the context of the particular statutory provisions involved in the matter \u2013 Ratio or the basis of reasons and principles underlying a decision is distinct from the ultimate relief granted or manner of disposal adopted in a given case \u2013 Thus, the ratio decidendi of a judgment is binding as a precedent and not the fi nal order in the judgment. [Para 13, 17 and 18] Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 141 \u2013 Binding precedent \u2013 Principle and purpose: Held: In terms of Art. 141, the ratio of the judgment is the binding precedent \u2013 Ratio decidendi of a judgment is the reason assigned in support of the conclusion \u2013 Legal principle underlying the decision would be binding as a precedent for a subsequent case \u2013 Thus, while applying a decision to a later case, the court dealing with it has to carefully ascertain the principle laid down in the previous decision \u2013 Decision in a case takes its fl avour from the facts of the case and the question of law involved and decided \u2013 However, a decision which is not express and is neither founded on any reason nor proceeds on a consideration of the issue cannot be deemed to be law declared, so as to have a binding eff ect as is contemplated u/Art. 141 \u2013 Decision applicable only to the facts of the case cannot be treated as a binding precedent \u2013 An order made merely to dispose of the case cannot have the value or eff ect of a binding precedent \u2013 Doctrine of binding precedent helps in promoting certainty and consistency in judicial decisions and enables an organic development of the law besides providing assurance to individuals as to the consequences of transactions forming part of daily affairs. [Para 16, 18, 19 and 22] Judicial discipline \u2013 Facet of: Held: Art. 141 states that all the courts in India, are bound to follow the decisions of the Supreme Court \u2013 This principle is an aspect of judicial discipline \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 141. [Para 16] Obiter dictum \u2013 Meaning and purpose: Held: Obiter dictum is an observation by a court on a legal question which may not be necessary for the decision pronounced by the court \u2013 However, the obiter dictum of the Supreme Court is binding u/Art. 141 to the extent of the observations on points raised and decided by the Court in a case \u2013 Though the obiter dictum of the Supreme Court is binding on all courts, it has only persuasive authority as far as the Supreme Court itself is concerned. [Para 20] Judgment/order \u2013 Interpretation of: Held: Words used in a judgment are not to be interpreted as those of a statute \u2013 Words used in a judgment should be rendered and understood contextually and are not intended to be taken literally \u2013 Decision is not an authority for what can be read into it by implication or by assigning an assumed intention of the judges and inferring from it a proposition of law which the judges have not specifi cally or expressly laid down in the pronouncement \u2013 Decision is an authority for what is specifi cally decided and not what can logically be deduced therefrom.

Customs Act, 1962 \u2013 Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 ss.529A, 530(1) \u2013 Customs duty \u2018due and payable\u2019 \u2013 \u2018relevant date\u2019 \u2013 Preferential payments u/clause (a) to s.530(1) \u2013 Customs Act if negates or overrides the statutory preference in terms of s.529A, Companies Act \u2013 Prior secured creditors if entitled to enforce their charge, notwithstanding the government dues payable under the Customs Act: Held: Upon import of the goods, the Company had entered the goods for home consumption u/s.46, Customs Act \u2013 However, the goods were stored in a private bonded warehouse, in the terms of s.68, Customs Act \u2013 Goods were not released on non-payment of customs duty etc. and, thereupon, show cause notices were issued and two adjudication orders dated 15.09.2000 and 10.10.2000 were passed \u2013 The debt had become \u2018due\u2019 in terms of the aforesaid two adjudication orders and \u2018payable\u2019 immediately \u2013 Thus, the customs duty became \u2018due and payable\u2019 prior to twelve months next to the \u2018relevant date\u2019; the \u2018relevant date\u2019 being the date of winding up of the Company on 01.12.2003 \u2013 The amount \u2018due and payable\u2019 in terms of the two adjudication orders would, thus, not fall in the category of preferential payments u/clause(a) to s.530(1), Companies Act \u2013 Provisions in the Customs Act do not, in any manner, negate or override the statutory preference in terms of s.529A, Companies Act, which treats the secured creditors and the workmen\u2019s dues as overriding preferential creditors; and the government dues limited to debts \u2018due and payable\u2019 in the twelve months next before the relevant date, which are to be treated as preferential payments u/s.530, Companies Act, but are ranked below overriding preferential payments and have to be paid after the payment has been made in terms of s.529 and 529A, Companies Act \u2013 Therefore, the prior secured creditors are entitled to enforce their charge, notwithstanding the government dues payable under the Customs Act \u2013 Impugned judgment set aside \u2013 Company Application fi led by the Offi cial Liquidator allowed \u2013 Sale proceeds deposited in Supreme Court and converted into fi xed deposit receipts, along with the interest accrued thereon, be paid to the Offi cial Liquidator to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of ss.529A and 530, Companies Act \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Article 372(1). [Paras 22, 23, 26 and 28] Customs Act, 1962 \u2013 s.142A \u2013 Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 ss.529A, 530: Held: Provision of s.142A, insofar as it protects the rights of overriding preferential creditors governed and covered by s.529A, Companies Act, is clarifi catory and declaratory in nature, and does not lay down a new dictum or confer any new right as far as the present case is concerned \u2013 However, the enactment of s.142A of the Customs Act does confer or create a fi rst charge on the dues \u2018payable\u2019 under the Customs Act, notwithstanding provisions under any Central Act, but not in cases covered u/s.529A of the Companies Act, RDDBFI Act, SARFAESI Act and the IBC \u2013 s.142A, Customs Act, post its enactment, would dilute the impact of s.530 of the Companies Act, which had restricted preferential treatment to government taxes \u2018due and payable\u2019 limited to twelve months prior to the \u2018relevant date\u2019, without preferential right for taxes that had become \u2018due and payable\u2019 in the earlier period. [Para 25] Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 ss.529A, 530 \u2013 Non-obstante nature of s.529A: Held: In view of the non-obstante nature of s.529A of the Companies Act, notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of the Companies Act or any other law for the time being in force on 24.05.1985, on winding up of a company, the debt due to the workmen and the debt due to secured creditors as specifi ed, rank pari passu and are to be paid in the manner prescribed therein in priority to all other debts \u2013 Provisions of s.529A of the Companies Act prevail over s.530 of the Companies Act \u2013 s.529A of the Companies Act, a non-obstante provision, is to be given primacy in case of confl ict, and consequently, in case of disharmony, this section will override the discordant provisions of the Companies Act and all other enactments in force and the debts are to be paid in terms of s.529A. [Paras 8, 10 and 11] Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 s.530(1)(a) \u2013 debts \u2018due\u2019 in the fi rst portion of clause (a) to s.530(1) and the words \u2018become due and payable within the twelve months next before that date\u2019 in the latter portion \u2013 Interpretation: Held: The words debt \u2018due\u2019 occurring in the fi rst part and the words debt \u2018due and payable\u2019 in the latter part of s.530(1)(a) of the Companies Act are diff erent expressions meant to convey diff erent and not the same meaning \u2013 Therefore, for a government debt to be covered under clause (a) to s.530(1), it must not only be a debt \u2018due\u2019, but it must also be a debt \u2018due and payable\u2019 within twelve months next before the relevant date \u2013 The requirements of the latter portion of clause (a) to s.530(1) are dual and cumulative, which is debt \u2018due and payable\u2019, and not one that is \u2018due\u2019 \u2013 The debt \u2018due\u2019 must have become payable at any time within twelve months next before the relevant date \u2013 The debt \u2018due and payable\u2019 prior to twelve months next to the relevant date is not a preferential debt in terms of s.530(1)(a) \u2013 Such debt will rank pari passu with ordinary or unsecured creditors, without any preferential treatment. [Paras 18] Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 s.530(8)(c) - \u2018relevant date\u2019: Held: As per sub-clause (i) to clause (c) to sub-Section (8) to s.530, the \u2018relevant date\u2019 in case where a company has been ordered to be wound up compulsorily, shall be the date of appointment or fi rst appointment of a provisional liquidator, or if no such appointment is made, the date of the winding up order, unless the company had commenced to be wound up voluntarily before that date \u2013 The present case is one of compulsory winding up and, therefore, the \u2018relevant date\u2019, in the absence of appointment of a provisional liquidator, would be the date on which the winding up order was passed against the Company, 01.12.2003.

Constitution of India \u2013 Article 141 \u2013 Decision in Pawan Gupta challenged by appellant by fi ling appeals before Supreme Court which were dismissed without any reasons being recorded \u2013 Review petitions there against were also dismissed \u2013 Article 141, if attracted: Held: Dismissal of the appeal in the case of Pawan Gupta without any reasons being recorded would not attract Article 141 as no law was declared by the Supreme Court, which will have a binding eff ect on all courts and tribunals in India \u2013 There is a clear distinction between the binding law of precedents in terms of Article 141 and the doctrine of merger and res judicata \u2013 Order passed by this Court dismissing the appeal in the case of Pawan Gupta would operate as res judicata in the said case but does not lay down a binding precedent applicable to other cases \u2013 It would not operate as res judicata in the case of the respondents against the appellant as they were not parties to the said case, and the proceedings initiated by Pawan Gupta were fact specifi c and not in a representative capacity \u2013 Thus, the order of this Court in Pawan Gupta cannot be read as a precedent and applied to the cases in hand \u2013 Precedents cannot decide questions of fact \u2013 In Pawan Gupta there was no material on record placed by the appellant showing the actual increase in the sale area \u2013 However, the appellant in the instant case had produced the Architect\u2019s certifi cates and reports to show that there was an actual increase in the sale area, justifying its demand for the extra payment and which documents were not contradicted by the respondents nor had they disputed the contents thereof \u2013 The decision in the case of Pawan Gupta was based on evidence adduced by the appellant-builder/developer, which was not found to be suffi cient and cogent to justify and substantiate the demand raised in view of the increased sale area \u2013 National Commission was therefore required to consider and examine the contentions of the appellant and not overrule the same on the grounds of the principle of res judicata and on the rule of binding precedent, which do not apply \u2013 Impugned judgment set aside \u2013 Matter remanded back in terms of the observations and directions given \u2013 Doctrine of merger \u2013 Res judicata \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Order XLI, r.27 \u2013 Consumer Protection. [Paras 31, 32, 35, 36 and 38] Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \u2013 s.69 \u2013 Limitation \u2013 \u2018Cause of action\u2019: Held: \u2018Cause of action\u2019 being the foundation of the claim refers to the entire set or bundle of facts necessary and material to prove in order to get a judgment \u2013 It refers to a defi nite point of time when the requisite ingredients constituting that \u2018cause of action\u2019 are complete \u2013 The \u2018cause of action\u2019 is complete when they provide the aggrieved party with the right to invoke jurisdiction of the court/forum \u2013 The test is to determine when the aggrieved person could have fi rst maintained action for a successful result \u2013 In the present case, communication/letter dtd. 27.04.2017 by the appellant was not the starting point of the \u2018cause of action\u2019 \u2013 It was an assertion, albeit without any specifi c details or particulars \u2013 The \u2018cause of action\u2019 arose when the appellant insisted and compelled the respondents/allottees to make payment, but did not furnish the details and particulars to enable the respondents/allottees to ascertain the actual allocated sale area \u2013 In the context of the present case, it is an accepted position that the sale deeds were executed with the respondents between the period from 13.04.2018 to as late as 09.01.2020 \u2013 Thus, the complaints fi led by the respondents cannot be dismissed on the ground of being barred by limitation u/s.69. [Para 14] Doctrine of merger \u2013 Logic behind: Held: The logic behind the doctrine of merger is that there cannot be more than one decree or operative orders governing the same subject matter at a given point of time \u2013 When a decree or order passed by an inferior court, tribunal or authority is subjected to a remedy available under law before a superior forum, then the decree or order under challenge continues to be eff ective and binding; nevertheless, its fi nality is put in jeopardy \u2013 Once the superior court disposes the dispute before it in any manner, either by affi rming the decree or order, by setting aside or modifying the same, it is the decree of the superior court, tribunal or authority, which is the fi nal binding and operative decree \u2013 The decree and order of the inferior court, tribunal or authority gets merged into the order passed by the superior forum \u2013 However, this doctrine is not of universal or unlimited application \u2013 The nature of jurisdiction exercised by the superior court and the content or subject matter of challenge laid or could have been laid will have to be kept in view \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Article 136. [Para 32] Consumer Protection \u2013 Acquiescence \u2013 Estoppel \u2013 Subsequent purchaser \u2013 Plea raised by the appellant on acquiescence and estoppel, as the respondents-allottees/subsequent buyers are seeking a refund of the amount paid without any demur or protest about four years after the payments were made \u2013 It was also argued that it is not even the case of the respondents that original allottees had made payments under some threat, coercion or duress: Held: As held in Laureate Buildwell Private Limited v. Charanjeet Singh the nature and extent of relief, to which the subsequent purchaser can be entitled is fact and situation dependent \u2013 It cannot be argued that a subsequent purchaser, who steps into the shoes of the original allottee of a housing project in which the builder has not honoured its commitment to deliver the fl at within the stipulated time, should not expect even reasonable time for the performance of builder\u2019s obligation \u2013 Such an argument, if accepted, would lead to a situation where a large number, possibly thousands of fl at buyers, waiting for their promised fl ats or residences would be left without any relief \u2013 Such a conclusion would be arbitrary \u2013 In these cases, it would be fair to assume that the subsequent purchaser had knowledge of the delay, but such knowledge cannot be extended to accept the submission that such delay shall continue indefi nitely based upon an a priori assumption \u2013 The equities have to be properly moulded \u2013 As these aspects and questions are essentially factual, albeit have not been ascertained and addressed in the present case, an order of remand to the National Commission is passed to examine the issue in light of the dictum laid down by this Court.
