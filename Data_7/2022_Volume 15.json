SEBI (Debenture Trustees) Regulations 1993 \u2013 Companies Act 1956 \u2013 S. 391 (s. 230 Analogous provision, Present law) \u2013 Company Act 2013 \u2013 SS. 1(4), 430 \u2013Retroactive application of SEBI Circular 13 October 2020 \u2013 Held: In the instant case, RCFL issued the debentures and defaulted on the payments to the debenture holders prior to the issuance of the SEBI Circular \u2013 However, as of 13 October 2020 (the date on which the SEBI Circular came into force), a compromise or agreement on the restructuring of the debt owed by RCFL did not exist \u2013 The debenture holders were not vested with any rights with respect to the resolution of RCFL\u2018s debt \u2013 The existence of the debt and the subsequent default by RCFL was the status of events, which existed prior to 13 October 2020 \u2013 Once it came into force, the SEBI Circular applied to the manner of resolution of debt, as specified therein "

Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 : ss.2(a), 3 \u2013 Appointment of Inquiry Commission under \u2013 Held: Commission under the Act shall be appointed either by the Executive or by the Legislature but not by the Judiciary in terms of the provisions of Inquiry Act \u2013 On facts, appointment of the Court Commissioner was though to substitute the Commissioner appointed under the Inquiry Act, but under the Inquiry Act, the Court could not appoint a Commissioner \u2013 Such power is conferred only on the executive and the legislature \u2013 Thus, the jurisdiction exercised in appointing Justice S.B.

(for Uday Umesh Lalit, CJI and himself)) : The Draft Rules framed, therefore, were a product of a thorough consultative exercise undertaken to remedy asymmetries caused by the lack of uniformity in Rules across States, which could hamper appreciation of evidence, and in turn delay proceedings, especially at the appellate stage \u2013 Some High Courts or governments of the States/ Union Territories have failed to comply with Supreme Court\u2019s order and are delayed in adopting the Draft Rules or amending the concerned police/practice manuals, cannot prejudice the right of an accused to receive the list of the statements \u2013 To say that the judgment in Manoj in relation to this, and the right of the accused to receive the list of documents, material, etc. would only apply after the Draft Rules are adopted would lead to an anomalous situation where the right of the accused in one State, prejudicially differs from that afforded to an accused, in another."

Constitution of India \u2013 Article 20 \u2013Code of CriminalProcedure, 1973 \u2013s.300 \u2013 Allegations against the respondent No.2-accused were of offence u/s.376 as allegedly committed in Delhi and u/ss.504 and 506 IPC where the respondent no.2 allegedly hurled abuses and extended threats which the appellant received over telephone at her village in Chamoli, Uttarakhand \u2013 Sessions Judge, Chamoli while discharging the respondent no.2 of the offence u/s.376 on the ground of lack of territorial jurisdiction transferred the matter to the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class, Gairsain, District Chamoli for trial of the respondent No. 2 in relation to the remaining offences u/ss.504 and 506 IPC wherein respondent no.2 was acquitted \u2013 Held: Respondent No.2 having gone through the trial in relation to offences u/ss.504 and 506 IPC and having been acquitted, cannot be subjected to another trial for the same charges on the same facts \u2013 Any such process would be in blatant disregard of the settled principles which disapprove double jeopardy and are precisely contained in Article 20(2), Constitution of India as also s.300, CrPC \u2013Protection u/clause (2) of Article 20 of the Constitution of India is clear and unambiguous.

Public interest litigation: Practice of filing frivolous petitions \u2013 Deprecated \u2013 Frivolous petitions are nothing but abuse of process of law \u2013 They encroach upon a valuable judicial time which could be otherwise utilized for considering genuine issues \u2013 It is high time that such so-called public interest litigations are nipped in the bud so that the developmental activities in the larger public interest are not stalled."

Delhi Land Reforms Act, 1954 \u2013 Hindu Succession Act, 1956 \u2013 State enactment relating to Agricultural land tenures, a special law \u2013 Held: The argument relating to 1956 Act being a special law and 1954 being a general law is completely misconceived as any State enactment relating to Agricultural land tenures is a special law."

(Concurring): A decision delivered by a Bench of largest strength is binding on any subsequent Bench of lesser or coequal strength \u2013 It is the strength of the Bench and not number of Judges who have taken a particular view which is said to be relevant \u2013 A Bench of lesser quorum cannot disagree or dissent from the view of law taken by a Bench of larger quorum \u2013 Thus, the numerical strength of the Judges taking a particular view is not relevant, but the Bench strength is determinative of the binding nature of the Judgment."

Collector-cum-District Manager, made imputations only against the respondent No. 3, who was a class IV employee of the Corporation but was purportedly posted as an in-charge Assistant Godown Manager by the appellant, who was, at the relevant time, holding the position of the District Manager \u2013 Suffice it to observe for the present purpose that when all the relevant aspects were duly projected before the High Court in the petition filed by the respondent No. 3, the High Court could not have simply ignored the same only for the reasons that the informant omitted to state them while lodging the FIR, and/or the investigating officer overlooked them while submitting the result of 34 investigation, and/or the Magistrate did not pay requisite attention to them while taking cognizance \u2013 Instant case is a case of exceptional and special features where the High Court was justified in ordering further investigation, particularly qua the role of the appellant \u2013 Thus, the principal part of the order impugned, directing further investigation, calls for no interference \u2013 However, High Court was not justified in making such observations, comments, and remarks, which leave little scope for an independent investigation and which carry all the potential to cause prejudice to the appellant.

SARFAESI Act : ss.13(2) and (4) \u2013 Failure of Borrower to repay loan as per payment schedule \u2013 Loans declared NPA \u2013 Notice issued by Bank under s.13(2) calling upon Borrower to discharge its liability \u2013 However, Borrower neither made any payment nor responded by way of reply \u2013 Thereafter, Borrower wrote letter in which while accepting defaults and non payment enlisted reasons for not being able to adhere to payment schedule and requested to grant further moratorium \u2013 Bank granted further moratorium and deferred action under SARFAESI Act to enable Borrower to submit detailed project/viability report \u2013 Borrower failed to fulfill promise made \u2013 Post this default also there were negotiations with assurances and promises by the Borrower \u2013 Displaying forbearance, the Bank granted indulgence as action under the SARFAESI Act was deferred for nearly one year \u2013 Thereafter Bank issued notice under s.13(4) and took symbolic possession of subject property \u2013 After several attempts to auction the property, fourth attempt was successful and property was sold and sale certificate issued \u2013 Before auction, Borrower was given notice of auction \u2013 Thereafter borrower filed petition before DRT challenging the enforcement proceedings in respect of the subject property including all steps taken right from issue of notice under s.13(2) of the SARFAESI Act \u2013 DRT dismissed borrower \u2019s application \u2013 Borrower preferred writ petition \u2013 Meanwhile auction purchaser sold the property to second purchaser \u2013 High Court held that the Borrower can challenge the possession notice, taking of symbolic possession notice, taking of physical possession, sale notice and sale certificate as they all form part of the same cause of action \u2013 High Court concluded that compliance with s.13(3A) being mandatory, Bank had failed to respond with reasons to the representations made by the Borrower \u2013 Instant appeal filed by second purchaser \u2013 Held : It is correct that waiver being an intentional relinquishment is not to be inferred by mere failure to take action, but the instant case is of repeated positive acts post the notices under ss.13(2) and (4) of the SARFAESI Act \u2013 Not only did the Borrower not question or object to the action of the Bank, but it by express and deliberate conduct had asked the Bank to compromise its position and alter the contractual terms \u2013 The Borrower wrote repeated request letters for restructuring of loans, which prayers were considered by the Bank by giving indulgence, time and opportunities \u2013 The Borrower, aware and conscious of its rights, chose to abandon the statutory claim and took its chance and even procured favourable decisions \u2013 Borrower\u2019s conduct had put the Bank in a position where they have lost time, and suffered on account of delay and laches, which aspects are material \u2013 Action on the subject property was delayed by more than a year as at the behest of the Borrower, the Bank gave them a long rope to regularise the account \u2013 To ignore the conduct of the Borrower would not be reasonable to the Bank once third party rights have been created \u2013 In this background, the principle of equitable estoppel as a rule of evidence bars the Borrower from complaining of violation \u2013 The Borrower challenged the actions taken by the Bank after the Subject Property had changed hands and third party interests had been created \u2013 Thus, the Borrower waived and is estopped from challenging violation of s.13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act.  Judgment/Order: Remedy/relief \u2013 Grant of, scope \u2013 Held: Power of the courts/judicial authorities to mould relief \u2013 While holding that the general approach is that the claimant who succeeds in establishing the unlawfulness of administrative action is entitled to grant of remedial order, the general proposition does not undermine the discretion which the courts or judicial authorities have in assessing \u201cwhat is fair and just to do in the particular case to withhold the remedy altogether or to mould the remedy by grant of a declaration rather than a more coercive quashing, prohibiting or mandatory order or injunction which may have been sought\u201d \u2013 Relief may be granted in respect of one aspect and not others \u2013 The general approach, therefore, is that a complainant who succeeds in establishing unlawfulness of an action is entitled to a remedial order, but the court has discretion in the sense of determining what is fair and just to do in a particular case."
