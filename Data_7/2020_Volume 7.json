Judicial Review: Legislative enactment \u2013 Constitutionality \u2013 Determination of \u2013 Held: In exercise of judicial review, the Court starts with a basic presumption in favour of constitutionality \u2013 While testing the constitutional validity of a provision, the Court is to inspect the existence of enacting power, and once such power is found to be present, the next examination is to ascertain whether the enacted provision impinges upon any right enshrined in Part III of the Constitution \u2013 While adjudicating constitutionality of a duly enacted provision, Court cannot venture into hypothetical spheres \u2013 Unfounded limitation cannot be read into the process of judicial review \u2013 The process of testing constitutional validity is not to sneak into the prudence or proprieties of the legislature in enacting the impugned provision, nor to examine the culpable conduct of the legislature as an appellate authority over the legislature \u2013 The role of the Court is restricted to the finding of a constitutional infirmity in the provision, as it is placed before the Court. Fiscal statutes \u2013 Judicial review of \u2013 The approach of Constitutional Courts ought to be different while dealing with fiscal statutes \u2013 The general principles of exclusion and inclusion do not apply to taxing statutes with the same vigour unless the law reeks of constitutional infirmities \u2013 A larger discretion is given to the legislature in taxing statutes than in other spheres. Legislation: A law when declared to be invalid, by Court, legislature is free to diagnose such law and alter the invalid elements thereof \u2013 In doing so, the legislature is not declaring the opinion of the Court to be invalid. Interpretation of Statutes: Non-obstante clause \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Held: A non- obstante clause assumes an over-riding character against any other provision of general application. Objects and reasons of the statute \u2013 As an aid to interpretation of statute \u2013 Nature of \u2013 When the Court examines the validity of a provision, its primary concern is literal text of the provision \u2013 This constitutes first test of interpretation \u2013 Interpretation of statute cannot be unrelated to the nature of the statute \u2013 Objects and reasons of the Statute are the external aids to the interpretation and can be looked into for a limited purpose in the process of interpretation, especially when the Court is sitting over the interpretation of an ambiguous provision \u2013 The Court is not bound by such external elements \u2013 Therefore, the presence or absence of objects and reasons have no impact upon the constitutional validity of a provision as long as the literal features of a provision enable the Court to comprehend its true meaning with sufficient clarity "

Revision: Revisional power \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: While exercising Revisional power, what is required to be seen is whether the order   under challenge is in violation of any statutory provision or a binding precedent or suffers from misreading of the evidence or omission to consider relevant clinching evidence or where the inference drawn from the facts proved is such that no person could arrive. Constitution of India: Art. 227 \u2013 Jurisdiction under \u2013 Nature and Scope of \u2013 Held: Though the powers u/Art. 227 are wide, they must be exercised sparingly and only to keep subordinate Courts and Tribunals within the bounds of their authority and not to correct mere errors \u2013 In the guise of exercising jurisdiction u/Art. 227, the High Court cannot convert itself into a court of appeal.

Nariman, J. (for himself, S. Ravindra Bhat and V. Ramasubramanian, JJ.) Special provisions of ss.65A and 65B are a complete Code in themselves when it comes to admissibility of evidence of information contained in electronic records \u2013 A written certificate u/s.65B(4) is a sine qua non for admissibility of such evidence \u2013 Oral evidence in place of such certificate cannot suffice as s.65B(4) is mandatory \u2013 However, on facts, the respondents having done everything possible to obtain the necessary certificate are relieved of the mandatory obligation \u2013 Moreover, apart from electronic record, other evidence was also relied upon by High Court to arrive at the same conclusion \u2013 Impugned judgment not faulted \u2013 Further, certificate u/s.65B(4) is unnecessary if the original document itself is produced \u2013 Anvar P.V., as clarified, is the law on s.65B \u2013 Shafhi Mohammad and the judgment dtd. 03.04.18 reported as [2018] 3 SCR 1096 are overruled \u2013 Per V.

Contract \u2013 Bailor and bailee relationship \u2013 Farmers\u2019 goods stored in a cold store was destroyed by fire \u2013 Cold store had got it insured from the insurance company \u2013 Insurance company contended that since the cold store held the goods in trust, they were not liable \u2013 Held: Rejected \u2013 Farmers paid consideration to the cold store and, therefore, the goods were not held in trust per se \u2013 Possession of the farm produce was handed over by the bailor, i.e. farmer to the cold store i.e. the bailee, in terms of the contract \u2013 This is not a case envisaged under Exclusion Clause 5 of the insurance policy \u2013 Goods were neither held on commission \u2013 Insurance. Doctrines/Principles\u2013 Principle of uberrima fides \u2013 When not applicable \u2013 Discussed. Consumer Protection \u2013 Insurance policy \u2013 Non-disclosure of material facts \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: To make a contract void the non- disclosure should be of some very material fact \u2013 Misrepresentation or misdescription only makes the policy voidable \u2013If the insurance company while accepting the proposal form does not ask the insured to clarify any ambiguities then after accepting the premium it cannot urge that a wrong declaration was made by the insured.

No. 11/2008 before the DRT \u2013 Thereafter, took symbolic possession of the secured assets \u2013 The guarantor filed a petition challenging the possession notice by the bank, which came to be rejected by the DRT \u2013 The secured assets were auctioned and a sale certificate in respect of the secured assets was issued to the appellant \u2013 Before the auction was finalised, the bank had moved an application before the DRT for return of the original documents to hand over the same to the auction purchaser upon issue of sale certificate \u2013 That application was rejected by the DRT on the ground that the issue was raised by the guarantor that there was no valid mortgage as the same was created by incompetent persons and the said issue was still to be examined by DRT in O.A. No. 11/2008 \u2013 However, the DRAT reversed the decision of DRT and directed return of original documents \u2013 Aggrieved, guarantor filed writ petition before the High Court and the order passed by the DRT was restored \u2013 Before the Supreme Court, in addition to the validity of mortgage, it was also contended that the sale certificate issued by the Bank refers to a land bearing Paimash no. 722/4 and the ancestors of respondent nos. 11 & 12 were owners of the said land \u2013 Thus, the said land could not have been made subject matter of mortgage in favour of the bank, as the guarantor had no title over it \u2013 Held: The guarantor has successively raised the issue regarding the validity of subject mortgage in different proceedings unsuccessfully \u2013 The concerned forum/Court unambiguously rejected the same \u2013 More importantly, the guarantor through its director had offered to pay the entire outstanding dues and also admitted on affidavit the factum of existence of subject mortgage in favour of the bank \u2013 Now, the guarantor cannot be permitted to resile from the admission of its liability \u2013 Notably, the auction sale stands concluded in favour of the appellant \u2013 Resultantly, the Bank is under legal obligation to handover the title deeds or the original documents \u2013 As far as the land bearing Paimash no.722/4 is concerned, the sale certificate, as issued by the Bank, does make reference to land bearing survey No. 282, which inter-alia, consists of old Paimash no. 722/4 \u2013 Therefore, to the said extent of land referred to in the decree passed by the District Court in favour of the respondent no. 11, despite the issuance of sale certificate, the title document in respect of old Paimash No. 722/4 ought not to be released until the final decision in O.A.No. 11/2008 is made by DRT \u2013 Therefore, the operative order of the DRAT is modified to the effect that application filed by the bank is partly allowed by ordering return of the original documents, except in respect of the land bearing Paimash No. 722/4 \u2013 Therefore, the impugned decision of the High Court is reversed.

Income Tax Act, 1961: s.147, first proviso \u2013 Limitation \u2013 Invocation of extended period \u2013 Allegation of non-disclosure of material facts \u2013 Allegation that the assessee was guilty of creating network of shell companies with a view to transfer its untaxed income in India to entities abroad and then bring it back to India thereby avoiding taxation \u2013 Revenue placed reliance on certain complaints made by the minority shareholders and it was alleged that those complaints revealed that assessee was indulging in round tripping of its funds \u2013 Held: These complaints did not see light of the day either before the High Court or before this Court and, therefore, it was unfair to the assessee if they were relied upon \u2013 Revenue can take the benefit of the extended period of limitation of 6 years for initiating proceedings under the first proviso s.147 of the Act, only if revenue can show that the assessee had failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment \u2013 Assessee had disclosed all the facts it was bound to disclose \u2013 If the revenue wanted to investigate the matter further at that stage it could have easily directed the assessee to furnish more facts \u2013 Assessee made a disclosure about having agreed to stand guarantee for the transaction by NNPLC and it had also disclosed the factum of the issuance of convertible bonds and their redemption \u2013 The income, if any, arose because of the redemption at a discounted price \u2013 This was an event which took place subsequent to the assessment year in question though it may be income for the assessment year \u2013 All relevant facts were duly within the knowledge of the assessing officer \u2013 Assessing officer knew who were the entities who had subscribed to other convertible bonds and in other proceedings relating to the subsidiaries the same assessing officer had knowledge of addresses and the consideration paid by each of the bondholders \u2013 The fact that step-up coupon bonds for US$ 100 million were issued by NNPLC was disclosed; who were the entities which subscribed to the bonds was disclosed; and the fact that the bonds were discounted at a lower rate was also disclosed before the assessment was finalised \u2013 This transaction was accepted by the assessing officer and it was clearly held that the assessee was only liable to receive guarantee fees on the same which was added to its income \u2013 It cannot be said that the assessee had withheld any material information from the revenue. Income Tax Act, 1961: s.147, second proviso \u2013 Plea of revenue that in terms of second proviso to s.147 r/w s.149(1)(c), limitation period would be 16 years since assessee has derived income from foreign entity \u2013 Held: The notice issued to assessee was silent with regard to second proviso \u2013 In the notice, there was no mention of any foreign entity \u2013 There was only mention of s.148 \u2013 There was nothing to indicate that revenue was intending to apply the extended period of 16 years \u2013 It was only after assessee filed its reply to the reasons given, that in the order of rejection for the first time, reference was made to the second proviso by the revenue \u2013 This is not fair or proper procedure \u2013 Assessee could not be taken by surprise at the stage of rejection of its objections or at the stage of proceedings before the High Court that the notice is to be treated as a notice invoking provisions of the second proviso of s.147 of the Act \u2013 Accordingly, the notice and the supporting reasons did not invoke provisions of the second proviso of s.147 of the Act and, therefore, at this stage the revenue cannot be permitted to take benefit of the second proviso.

Adverse Possession: Suit for declaration of ownership and for possession of the suit premises \u2013 Alleging that the suit premises was let out to the defendant \u2013 Written statement denying the tenancy and claiming absolute ownership \u2013 Trial Court dismissed the suit \u2013 First Appellate Court partly decreed the suit holding that the plaintiff was entitled to ownership of half portion of the suit property which his father had purchased and not the other portion which was purchased by father of the defendant \u2013 However, First Appellate Court denied decree of possession to the plaintiff on the ground that the plaintiff failed to prove the tenancy and that the defendant was in occupation of the premises for a long time \u2013 Second appeal by both the parties \u2013 High Court dismissed the appeal of defendant and allowing the appeal of the plaintiff granted him relief of recovery of possession \u2013 Appeal to Supreme Court \u2013 Held: A person in possession, in the assumed character of owner has a perfectly good title against all but the rightful owner \u2013 But if the rightful owner does not assert his right of possession, within limitation period, his right is extinguished forever, and the possessory owner acquires an absolute title \u2013 The conclusion of the First Appellate Court did not warrant interference \u2013 High Court could not have reversed the finding of First Appellate Court and allowed relief of recovery of possession when the defendant was in complete possession of the suit premises, as owner with absolute rights for over 28 years. Maxims: \u2018Possession follows title\u2019 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: The maxim is limited in its application to property \u2013 The presumption that possession must be deemed to follow title, arises only where there is no definite proof of possession by anyone else \u2013 A person claiming decree of possession needs to establish his entitlement to get such possession and also establish that his claim is not barred by law of limitation.

        "HeadNote": "  Architects Act, 1972 \u2013 s. 37 \u2013 Prohibition against use of title \u2013 The High Court held that s.37 of the Architects Act does not create a bar on individuals not registered with the Council of Architecture from carrying out the duties and functions of an Architect \u2013 On appeal, held: A plain reading of s.37 clearly supports the proposition that the Architects Act prohibits individuals not registered with the Council of Architecture from using the title and style of \u2018Architect\u2019 and does not prohibit unregistered individuals from practicing the activities undertaken by Architects such as the design, supervision and construction of buildings \u2013 The legislature stated in the \u2018Statement of objects and reasons\u2019 that with the passing of the legislation, it shall be unlawful for an unregistered individual to \u2018designate himself \u2019 as an Architect \u2013 Further, it is expressly stated that the legislation protects the \u2018title\u2019 of Architect but does not grant registered Architects an exclusive right to undertake the design, supervision and construction of buildings \u2013 Thus, it is evident that legislature did not intend to create a prohibition on the practice of architecture and associated activities by unregistered individuals \u2013 However, by virtue of the Architects Act, anybody engaging the services of an individual calling themselves an \u2018Architect\u2019 is assured that such an individual possesses statutorily recognised educational qualifications and is competent to complete the task at hand \u2013 It is in this manner that the legislature protects the common person from untrained individuals \u2013 Thus, the decision of the High Court holding that s.37 of the Architects Act does not prohibit individuals not registered under the Architects Act from undertaking the practice of architecture is affirmed. Architects Act, 1972 \u2013 Whether a Government Post titled or styled using the term \u2018Architect\u2019 can be held by individuals not registered with the Council of Architecture \u2013 The High Court held that the \u2018mere nomenclature\u2019 of a particular post will not violate the prohibition on the use of \u2018title and style\u2019 of architect u/s. 37 \u2013 On appeal, held: s.37 prohibits unregistered individuals from designating themselves or referring to themselves as \u2018Architects\u2019 \u2013 If a Government Post is titled \u2018Architect\u2019 or \u2018Associate Architect\u2019, such a person certainly uses the title and style of \u2018Architect\u2019 and consequently there is a reasonable assumption that such a person is registered under the Architects Act and holds a degree in architecture recognised by the Act \u2013 To promote an individual who does not possess a degree in architecture recognised by the Act to a post titled \u2018Architect\u2019, \u2018Associate Architect\u2019 or of a similar style using the title or style of \u2018Architect\u2019 would effectively violate the prohibition on the use of title contained in s. 37 of the Architects Act \u2013 The text of s.37 makes no distinction between government employees and private individuals \u2013 Thus, authorities cannot promote or recruit individuals who do not hold a degree in architecture recognised by the Architects Act to a post that uses the title or style of \u2018Architect\u2019 \u2013 The view of the High Court is disapproved. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 The first and best method of determining the intention of the legislature is the very words chosen by the legislature to have the force of law \u2013 In other words, the intention of the legislature is best evidenced by the text of the statute itself \u2013 However, where a plain reading of the text of the statute leads to an absurd or unreasonable meaning, the text of the statute must be construed in light of the object and purpose with which the legislature enacted the statute as a whole. Delegated Legislation \u2013 Primary Legislation \u2013 It is well established that delegated legislation is susceptible to invalidity on the grounds of being ultra vires its parent legislation but also ultra vires other primary legislation \u2013 Where the provisions of a primary legislation (The Architect Act, 1972) are contradictory to the provisions of a delegated legislation (The Promotion Policy 2005), the provisions of the primary legislation must prevail.

Interpretation of Statutes: Word \u2018shall\u2019 \u2013 Connotation of \u2013 Held: The use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in a statute, does not necessarily mean that in every case it is mandatory that unless the words of the statute are literally followed, the proceeding or the outcome of the proceeding, would be invalid \u2013 It is also not always correct to say that if the word \u201cmay\u201d has been used, the statute is only permissive or directory in the sense that non-compliance with those provisions will not render the proceeding invalid and that when a statute uses the word \u201cshall\u201d, prima facie, it is mandatory, but the Court may ascertain the real intention of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute \u2013 Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 \u2013 s.14.

Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 \u2013 The Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court, 1975 \u2013 Two letters dated 20.3.2019 and 19.3.2019 signed by alleged contemnor nos. 1 and 2 were circulated \u2013 The tenor of the letters was highly disrespectful, and scandalous and scurrilous allegations were levelled against the two Judges of the Supreme Court \u2013 A Bench issued notice to the contemnors and directed that the matter be placed before the Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate bench to hear and decide the contempt case \u2013 The alleged contemnors filed applications for discharge of notices issued to them \u2013 The main ground for discharge was that the notice sent was not in accordance with the provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 \u2013 Held: The Supreme Court has its own Rules, i.e. The Rules to Regulate Proceedings for Contempt of the Supreme Court, 1975 and Form I lays down the manner in which notice is to be issued \u2013 The only requirement of the Rules and the Form is that the brief nature of the contempt is to be stated in the Form \u2013 There is no requirement of giving all the documents with the Form \u2013 A perusal of the order whereby contempt proceedings were initiated clearly shows that the grounds for initiating contempt were reflected in the order itself \u2013 Therefore, the notice was legal and valid. Contempt of Court \u2013 Supreme Court \u2013 Challenge to suo motu proceedings \u2013 Two letters dated 20.03.2019 and 19.03.2019 admittedly signed by contemnor Nos. 1 & 2 were circulated \u2013 The tenor of the letters was highly disrespectful, and scandalous and scurrilous allegations were levelled against the two Judges of the Supreme Court \u2013 A Bench of Supreme Court issued notice to the contemnors \u2013 The contemnors contended that the proceedings are not suo motu proceedings and, therefore, should not have been entertained without the consent of the Attorney-General or Solicitor- General \u2013 Held: Contempt is basically a matter between the Court and the contemnor \u2013 Any person can inform the Court of the contempt committed \u2013 If he is to be arrayed as a party then the contempt will be in his name but when the Court does not array him as a party, the Court can on the basis of the information itself take suo motu of the contempt \u2013 In the present case, the Court on the basis of the information itself took suo motu note of the contempt and the matter was then placed before the Hon\u2019ble the Chief Justice for listing it before the appropriate Bench \u2013 The matter listed was a suo motu contempt petition right from the beginning. Contempt of Court \u2013 Supreme Court \u2013 Suo motu proceedings \u2013 Judge in their own cause \u2013 Two letters dated 20.03.2019 and 19.03.2019 admittedly signed by contemnor Nos. 1 & 2 were circulated \u2013 The tenor of the letters was highly disrespectful, and scandalous and scurrilous allegations were levelled against the two Judges of the Supreme Court \u2013 A Bench of Supreme Court issued notice to the contemnors \u2013 The Bench also directed that the matter be placed before the Chief Justice of India to constitute an appropriate Bench to hear and decide the contempt case \u2013 The contemnors contended that the Bench could not have issued the notice without the matter being placed before it and further that this amounted to them acting as judges in their own cause \u2013 Held: The Bench was already dealing with Suo Motu Contempt Petition (Crl.) No. 1 of 2019 \u2013 The said letters were placed before the Bench \u2013 After issuing notice, the bench directed that the matter be placed before Hon\u2019ble Chief Justice for placing before the appropriate Bench \u2013 This is valid and proper procedure and the Bench did not act as Judge in their own cause \u2013 Only notice was issued and thereafter the matter was assigned to another Bench. Constitution of India \u2013 Freedom to criticise the judgments of the Court \u2013 Held: Any citizen of the Country can criticise the judgments delivered by any Court including the Supreme Court \u2013 However, no party has the right to attribute motives to a Judge or to question the bonafides of the Judge or to raise questions with regard to the competence of the Judge \u2013 Judges are part and parcel of the justice delivery system. Contempt of Court \u2013 Supreme Court \u2013 Suo motu proceedings \u2013 Two letters were circulated \u2013 The tenor of two letters dated 20.03.2019 and 19.03.2019 admittedly signed by contemnor Nos. 1 & 2 was highly disrespectful, and scandalous and scurrilous allegations were levelled against the two Judges of the Supreme Court \u2013 The notice was issued to all the four alleged contemnors \u2013 The contemnor no. 4 filed an application for discharge and his application was allowed \u2013 Held: The first letter dated 20.03.2019 by contemnor No. 1 is basically in relation to the order dated 12.03.2019 in Suo Motu Contempt Petition (Crl.) No.1 of 2019, in which contemnor No. 4 was held guilty of contempt and notice was issued to contemnor No. 4 for hearing him on issue of punishment \u2013 In the meantime, both the contemnors No. 1 and 2 sent these letters praying that action be taken against the members of the Bench of the Supreme Court \u2013 The contemnor no. 3 indicated in his discharge application that the letters sent by contemnors no. 1 and 2 were sent with the knowledge and consent of contemnor no. 3 \u2013 Also, the contemnor no. 3, while arguing the matter was supporting each and everything said in letters by contemnors no. 1 and 2 \u2013 Therefore, all three alleged contemnor nos. 1, 2 and 3 were working in tandem and making scurrilous and scandalous allegations against the members of the Bench of Supreme Court, probably with intention that the members would thereafter not take action against contemnor no. 4 in Suo Motu Contempt Petition (Crl.) No.1 of 2019 \u2013 Thus, all three alleged contemnors no. 1, 2 and 3 are guilty of contempt. "
