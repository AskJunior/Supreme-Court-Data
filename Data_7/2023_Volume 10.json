Act, 1961 \u2013 Further, there is no justification shown and/ordemonstrated to exclude \u201ca Sikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008\u201d from the exempted category \u2013 Thediscrimination is based on gender which is wholly violative of Arts.14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution \u2013 To deny the benefit of exemptionu/s. 10(26AAA) of the Income Tax Act to \u201ca Sikkimese woman, whomarries a non-Sikkimese af ter 01.04.2008\u201d is arbitrary,discriminatory and violative of Art. 14 \u2013 Therefore the Proviso tos.10(26AAA) insofar as it excludes from the exempted category \u201caSikkimese woman, who marries a non-Sikkimese after 01.04.2008\u201dhas to be struck down \u2013 Held (per B.V. Nagarathna, J.): Under the1961 Regulation, for women marriage has been the basis ofacquiring the status of having a domicile in Sikkim and being aSikkim Subject or losing domicile or status as a Sikkim Subject \u2013Marriage of a Sikkimese woman is also the basis for discriminationagainst her whereas there is no such discrimination vis-\u00e0-vis aSikkimese man marrying a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese womanon or after 1st April, 2008 \u2013 When the Explanation to s.10(26AAA)refers to an \u201cindividual\u201d, it includes both Sikkimese men and women,in fact, all genders \u2013 Therefore, it cannot have a restrictive or myopicreference to only Sikkimese men and exclude those Sikkimese women\u2013 In the instant case, the proviso is overriding the provision as wellas the Explanation in respect of those categories of marriedSikkimese women \u2013 The proviso is inherent ly arbitrary anddiscriminatory against a particular category of Sikkimese women \u2013Hence, al l Sikkimese women are entitled to the benefit ofs.10(26AAA) as per the Explanation thereto irrespective of whetherthey marry a Sikkimese or a non-Sikkimese \u2013 The proviso toClause(26AAA) of s. 10 of the I.T. Act, 1961 is struck down as being in violation of Arts. 14 and 15 \u2013 The object and purpose of theexemption is only to exempt the settlers in Sikkim or personsdomiciled in Sikkim in terms of the 1961 Regulation or theGovernment Orders \u2013 All individuals domiciled in Sikkim till 26thApril, 1975 and who have since become citizens of India are entitledto exemption from payment of income tax \u2013 Only such individualsare entitled to the exemption who fall within the three clauses of theExplanation \u2013 All other citizens of India who do not fall within theambit of the Explanation and who have been domiciled in SikkimState subsequent to 26th April, 1975 would not have the benefit ofexemption \u2013 This would be discriminatory insofar as those settlersin Sikkim are concerned who have been domiciled in Sikkimsubsequent to promulgation of 1961 Regulation and till 26th April,1975 \u2013 Such individuals are old settlers who have become citizensof India from 26th April, 1975 but who were domiciled in Sikkimprior to the said date \u2013 These old settlers are also entitled to theexemption under s.10 (26AAA) \u2013 Hence, directions in that regardhave to be issued to fill the Legislative vacuum and amendment tothe Explanation is necessary \u2013 Directions issued to eliminate thediscrimination and to save the Explanation from being renderedunconstitutional \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 14, 15, 21 and 142.Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Internal Aid \u2013 Proviso \u2013 Functionof \u2013 Held: The normal function of a proviso is to except somethingout of the provision or to qualify something enacted therein which,but for the proviso, would be within the purview of the provision \u2013A proviso is added to an enactment to qualify or create an exceptionto what is in the enactment \u2013 A proviso cannot be construed asnullifying the provision or as taking away completely a rightconferred by the enactment \u2013 If it does so and is discriminatorythen it falls foul of the equality clauses of the Constitution of India."

Incumbents in the office of the Directorof CBI /Director of Enforcement \u2013 Extension of tenure \u2013 Validity ofCentral Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Act, 2021 (whereby twonew provisos were inserted to s.25(d) of the Central VigilanceCommission Act), the Delhi Special Police Establishment(Amendment) Act, 2021 (whereby two new provisos were inserted tos.4B(1) of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946) andthe Fundamental (Amendment) Rules, 2021 (whereby the fifth provisoto F.R. 56(d) was substituted by a new proviso) \u2013 Challenge to \u2013Held: The argument that the impugned Amendments grant arbitrarypower to the Government to extend the tenure of the Director ofED/CBI and has the effect of wiping out the insulation of theseoffices from extraneous pressures, is not tenable \u2013 It is not at thesweet-will of the Government that the extensions can be granted tothe incumbents in the office of the Director of CBI /Director ofEnforcement \u2013 What has been directed by this Court in the case ofVineet Narain and in subsequent judgments relied on by thepetitioners is that such Director should have a minimum tenure oftwo years irrespective of their date of superannuation \u2013 By theimpugned Amendments, the said period is not tinkered with \u2013 Whathas been done is only a power is given to extend their period for aperiod of one year at a time, subject to a maximum number of threesuch extensions \u2013 However, this has to be done only when theCommittee which is constituted to recommend their appointment findsit necessary, in public interest, to grant such extension \u2013 It is furtherrequired to record the reasons in writing for the said purpose \u2013When a Committee can be trusted with regard to recommending theirinitial appointment, there is no reason as to why such Committeescannot be trusted to consider as to whether the extension is required to be given in public interest or not \u2013 Challenge to validity of CentralVigilance Commission (Amendment) Act, 2021, the Delhi SpecialPolice Establishment (Amendment) Act, 2021, and the Fundamental(Amendment) Rules, 2021 not tenable.Mandamus \u2013 Nullification of, by enactment \u2013 Issue of legislativeoverride \u2013 Intrusion into judicial power by the legislature \u2013Incumbents in the office of the Director of CBI /Director ofEnforcement \u2013 Extension of tenure \u2013 Whether the impugned ordersdated 17th November, 2021 and 17th November 2022, which grantedextensions to the tenure of respondent no.2-Director of Enforcementfor a period of one year each, were not valid in light of the specificmandamus issued by this Court in the earlier case of Common Cause(2021) that no further extension shall be granted to respondent no.2\u2013 Held: Effect of the judgments of this court can be nullified by alegislative act removing the basis of the judgment \u2013 Such law canbe retrospective \u2013 However, retrospective amendment should bereasonable and not arbitrary and must not be violative of thefundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution \u2013 Defectpointed out should be cured such that the basis of the judgmentpointing out the defect is removed \u2013 Nullification of mandamus byan enactment, however, would be impermissible legislative exercise\u2013 Transgression of constitutional limitations and intrusion into thejudicial power by the legislature is violative of the principle ofseparation of powers, the rule of law and of Art.14 of the Constitution\u2013 In the case of Common Cause (2021), this Court had specificallyissued a mandamus that no further extension shall be granted torespondent no.2 \u2013 The Union of India and respondent No.2 wereboth parties in the proceedings before this Court in Common Cause(2021) \u2013 The mandamus issued to be parties was binding on them \u2013Therefore, respondent No.1 could not have issued orders dated 17thNovember 2021 and 17th November 2022 (granting extensions tothe tenure of respondent No.2 for a period of one year each) inbreach of the mandamus issued by this Court in Common Cause(2021) \u2013 The impugned orders dated 17th November 2021 and 17thNovember 2022 are accordingly illegal \u2013 However, on facts, in thelarger public interest, respondent No.2 permitted to continue in officetill 31st July, 2023 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14 \u2013 Service Law.Judicial review \u2013 Scope of, in examining legislative functionsof the Legislature \u2013 Role of the judiciary \u2013 Held: Judicial review is a powerful weapon to restrain unconstitutional exercise of powerby the legislature and executive \u2013 The role of the Court is limited toexamine as to whether the Legislature or the Executive has actedwithin the powers and functions assigned under the Constitution \u2013However, while doing so, the Court must remain within its selfimposedlimits.Judicial review \u2013 Of Legislative enactment \u2013 Scope \u2013 Held:Statute enacted by Parliament or a State Legislature cannot bedeclared unconstitutional lightly \u2013 Unless there is flagrant violationof the constitutional provisions, the law made by Parliament or aState Legislature cannot be declared bad \u2013 Legislative enactmentcan be struck down only on two grounds \u2013 Firstly, that the appropriatelegislature does not have the competence to make the law; andsecondly, that it takes away or abridges any of the fundamentalrights enumerated in Part III of the Constitution or any otherconstitutional provisions \u2013 No enactment can be struck down byjust saying that it is arbitrary or unreasonable \u2013 Some or the otherconstitutional infirmity has to be found before invalidating an Act \u2013Parliament and the legislatures, composed as they are of therepresentatives of the people, are supposed to know and be awareof the needs of the people and what is good and bad for them \u2013 Thecourt cannot sit in judgment over their wisdom \u2013 Constitution ofIndia \u2013 Part III."

The Union Ministry of Information andBroadcasting (MIB) revoked the permission which it had grantedto Madhyamam Broadcasting Limited to uplink and downlink a newsand current affairs television channel called \u201cMedia One\u201d \u2013 MIBrevoked the permission that was granted to uplink and downlink\u2018Media One\u2019 because of the denial of a security clearance \u2013Appellants initiated proceedings under Article 226 of theConstitution before the High Court for challenging the action ofthe first respondent \u2013 A Single Judge dismissed the petitions \u2013 Writappeal was dismissed by the Division Bench of the High Court \u2013The High Court relied on material which was disclosed solely to theCourt in a sealed cover by the second respondent, the Union Ministryof Home Affairs \u2013 Held: The challenge to the order of the MIB andjudgment of the High Court on procedural grounds is allowed \u2013The core of the principles of natural justice breathes reasonablenessinto procedure \u2013 The burden is on the claimant to prove that theprocedure followed infringes upon the core of proceduralguarantees \u2013 The appellants have proved that MBL\u2019s right to a fairhearing has been infringed by the unreasoned order of the MIB,and the non-disclosure of relevant material to the appellants, andits disclosure solely to the court \u2013 The burden then shifts on therespondents to prove that the procedure that was followed wasreasonable and in compliance with the requirements of Articles 14and 21 of the Constitution \u2013 Though confidentiality and nationalsecurity are legitimate aims for the purpose of limiting proceduralguarantees, the state has been unable to prove that theseconsiderations arise in the present factual scenario \u2013 A blanket immunity from disclosure of all investigative reports cannot begranted \u2013 The validity of the claim of involvement of national securityconsiderations must be assessed on the test of (i) whether there ismaterial to conclude that the non-disclosure of information is in theinterest of national security; and (ii) whether a reasonable prudentperson would draw the same inference from the material on record\u2013Even assuming that non-disclosure is in the interest of confidentialityand national security, the means adopted by the respondents do notsatisfy the other prongs of the proportionality standard \u2013 The nondisclosureof a summary of the reasons for the denial of securityclearance to MBL, which constitutes the core irreducible minimumof procedural guarantees, does not satisfy the suitability prong \u2013The challenge to the order of MIB is allowed on substantive grounds\u2013 The non-renewal of permission to operate a media channel is arestriction on the freedom of the press which can only be reasonablyrestricted on the grounds stipulated in Article 19(2) of theConstitution \u2013 The reasons for denying a security clearance to MBL,that is, its alleged anti-establishment stance and the alleged link ofthe shareholders to JEI-H, are not legitimate purposes for therestriction of the right of freedom of speech protected under Article19(1)(a) of the Constitution \u2013 In any event, there was no material todemonstrate any link of the shareholders, as was alleged.National Security \u2013 Concerns of \u2013 Held: Do not permit anabsolute abrogation of the principles of natural justice \u2013 The mereinvolvement of issues concerning national security would notpreclude the state\u2019s duty to act fairly \u2013 However, the principle ofnatural justice may be excluded when on the facts of the case,national security concerns outweigh the duty of fairness \u2013 Thus,national security is one of the few grounds on which the right to areasonable procedural guarantee may be restricted \u2013 If the Statediscards its duty to act fairly, then it must be justified before thecourt on the facts of the case \u2013 Firstly, the State must satisfy theCourt that national security concerns are involved \u2013 Secondly, theState must satisfy the court that an abrogation of the principle(s) ofnatural justice is justified \u2013 These two standards that have emergedfrom the jurisprudence abroad resemble the proportionality standard\u2013 The first test resembles the legitimate aim prong, and the second test of justification resembles the necessity and the balancing prongs\u2013 It is not sufficient for the State to identify its purpose in broadconceptual terms such as national security and public order \u2013 Rather,it is imperative for the State to prove through the submission ofcogent material that non-disclosure is in the interest of nationalsecurity \u2013 It is the Court\u2019s duty to assess if there is sufficient materialfor forming such an opinion \u2013 A claim cannot be made out of thinair without material backing for such a conclusion \u2013 The Courtmust determine if the State makes the claim in a bona fide manner \u2013The Court must assess the validity of the claim of purpose bydetermining (i) whether there is material to conclude that the nondisclosureof the information is in the interest of national security;and (ii) whether a reasonable prudent person would arrive at thesame conclusion based on the material \u2013 The court allows duedeference to the State to form its opinion but reviews the opinion onlimited grounds of whether there is nexus between the material andthe conclusion \u2013 The Court cannot second-guess the judgment ofthe State that the purpose identified would violate India\u2019s nationalsecurity \u2013 It is the executive wing and not the judicial wing that hasthe knowledge of India\u2019s geo-political relationships to assess if anaction is in the interest of India\u2019s national security \u2013 Natural Justice.Investigative agencies \u2013 Reports of \u2013 Held: The reports ofthe intelligence agencies are not merely fact-finding reports \u2013 Toargue that reports of the intelligence agencies may containconfidential information is one thing but to argue that the all suchreports are confidential is another \u2013 Such an argument is misplacedand cannot be accepted on the touchstone of constitutional values\u2013 The reports by investigative agencies impact decisions on the life,liberty, and profession of individuals and entities, and to give suchreports absolute immunity from disclosure is antithetical to atransparent and accountable system \u2013 A blanket immunity fromdisclosure of all investigative reports cannot be granted.Practice and Procedure \u2013 Disclosure of Relevant Material \u2013Open Justice \u2013 Sealed cover procedure \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Less RestrictiveMeans \u2013 Public interest immunity claim \u2013 Suggestive Course of Action\u2013 Held: Sealed cover procedures violate both principles of naturaljustice and open justice \u2013 When relevant material is disclosed in asealed cover, there are two injuries that are perpetuated \u2013 First, the documents are not available to the affected party \u2013 Second, thedocuments are relied upon by the opposite party (which is mostoften the State) in the course of the arguments, and the court arrivesat a finding by relying on the material \u2013 In such a case, the affectedparty does not have any recourse to legal remedies because it wouldbe unable to (dis)prove any inferences from the material before theadjudicating authority \u2013 This form of adjudication perpetuates aculture of secrecy and opaqueness, and places the judgment beyondthe reach of challenge \u2013 The affected party would be unable to\u201ccontradict errors, identify omissions, challenge the credibility ofinformants or refute false allegations\u201d \u2013 The right to seek judicialreview which has now been read into Arts. 14 and 21 is restricted \u2013A corresponding effect of the sealed cover procedure is a nonreasonedorder \u2013 If the purpose could be realised effectively bypublic interest immunity proceedings or any other less restrictivemeans, then the sealed cover procedure should not be adopted \u2013The court should undertake an analysis of the possible proceduralmodalities that could be used to realise the purpose, and the meansthat are less restrictive of the procedural guarantees must be adopted\u2013 The courts could take the course of redacting confidential portionsof the document and providing a summary of the contents of thedocument to fairly exclude materials after a successful public interestimmunity claim.Practice and Procedure \u2013 Difference between sealed coverprocedure and public interest immunity claims \u2013 Held: One crucialdifference between the sealed cover procedure and public interestimmunity claims is that in the former, the court relies on the materialthat is disclosed in a sealed cover in the course of the proceedings,as opposed to the latter where the documents are completely removedfrom the proceedings and both the parties and the adjudicator cannotrely on such material \u2013 The courts assess the validity of publicinterest immunity claims, which address the same harms as the sealedcover procedure, based on the structured proportionality standard\u2013 The power of courts to secure material in a sealed cover whencontradistinguished with the scope of assessment of public interestimmunity claims is rather unguided and ad-hoc \u2013 The standard ofreview that is used by the courts in public interest immunity claimsand the lack of such a standard in sealed cover proceedings to protect procedural safeguards indicates that public interest immunityclaims constitute less restrictive means \u2013 Additionally, while publicinterest immunity claims conceivably impact the principles of naturaljustice, sealed cover proceedings infringe the principles naturaljustice and open justice.Practice and Procedure \u2013 Public interest immunity claim \u2013Held: While Public interest immunity claim is a less restrictive means,the dilution of procedural guarantees while hearing the claim cannotbe ignored by the Court \u2013 The court has a duty to consider factorssuch as the relevance of the material to the case of the applicantwhile undertaking the proportionality standard to test the publicinterest immunity claim.Media \u2013 Press \u2013 Role and independence of \u2013 Held: Anindependent press is vital for the robust functioning of a democraticrepublic \u2013 Its role in a democratic society is crucial for it shines alight on the functioning of the state \u2013 The press has a duty to speaktruth to power, and present citizens with hard facts enabling them tomake choices that propel democracy in the right direction \u2013 Therestriction on the freedom of the press compels citizens to think alongthe same tangent \u2013 A homogenised view on issues that range fromsocio-economic polity to political ideologies would pose gravedangers to democracy \u2013 On facts, the critical views of the Channel,Media-One on policies of the government cannot be termed, \u2018antiestablishment\u2019\u2013 The use of such a terminology in itself, representsan expectation that the press must support the establishment \u2013 Theaction of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB)by denying a security clearance to a media channel on the basis ofthe views which the channel is constitutionally entitled to holdproduces a chilling effect on free speech, and in particular on pressfreedom \u2013 Criticism of governmental policy can by no stretch ofimagination be brought within the fold of any of the groundsstipulated in Article 19(2) \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19(2).Policy \u2013 Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting(MIB) \u2013 Policy Guidelines for Uplinking of Television Channelsfrom India \u2013 Paragraph 10.4 of the Uplinking Guidelines asmodified by the \u2018permission letter\u2019 indicates that the Union Ministryof Home Affairs (MHA) could deny security clearance on thegrounds of national security and public order \u2013 Thus, according to the Uplinking and Downlinking guidelines, security clearance fromMHA is one of the conditions that is required to be fulfilled forrenewal of permission for Uplinking and Downlinking of newschannels.Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Natural Justice \u2013 Requirement ofreasoned order \u2013 Held: The principles of natural justice ensurethat justice is not only done but it is seen to be done as well \u2013 Areasoned order is one of the fundamental requirements of fairadministration \u2013 A non-reasoned order perpetuates the nonapplicationof judicial mind in assessing the veracity of the inputs\u2013 The nexus of the reasons to the order cannot be adjudicated uponif the reasons are not disclosed.Words and Phrases \u2013 Expression \u201cnational security\u201d \u2013Meaning of \u2013 Held: The expression national security does not havea fixed meaning \u2013 While courts have attempted to conceptuallydistinguish national security from public order, it is impossible (andperhaps unwise) to lay down a text-book definition of the expressionwhich can help the courts decide if the factual situation is coveredwithin the meaning of the phrase \u2013 The phrase derives its meaningfrom the context

Bhima-Koregaon violence \u2013 FIR \u2013 Scopeof the investigation was expanded \u2013 Searches were conducted atthe residences/workplaces of the appellants and they were arrested\u2013 Case of the NIA is that various letters and other materials recoveredfrom the arrested co-accused persons showed appellants\u2019involvement with the CPI (Maoist), an organization placed in theFirst Schedule to the 1967 Act as a terrorist organization \u2013 It isalleged that the appellants played an active role in recruitment ofand training for cadres of the said organization and that one of theappellant also had role in managing finances thereof \u2013 Bail plea ofthe appellants dismissed by High Court \u2013 Held: Contents of theletters through which the appellants are sought to be implicated arein the nature of hearsay evidence, recovered from co-accused \u2013 Nocovert or overt terrorist act was attributed to the appellants in theseletters or any other material \u2013 The letters were not recovered fromthe appellants \u2013 Hence, these communications or content thereofhave weak probative value or quality \u2013 No credible case ofconspiracy to commit offences enumerated under Chapter IV andVI \u2013 Mere participation in seminars by itself cannot constitute anoffence under the bail-restricting Sections of the 1967 Act \u2013 Nomaterial was demonstrated that the appellants are members of theterrorist organization \u2013 The funds, dealing with which was attributedto one of the appellant cannot be connected to any terrorist act \u2013No reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation againstthe appellant of committing or conspiring to commit terrorist act isprima facie true \u2013 Juxtaposing the appellants\u2019 case founded onArticles 14 and 21 with the allegations and considering the factthat almost five years have lapsed since they were taken into custody,the appellants have made out a case for granting bail \u2013 Impugned judgments set aside \u2013 Appellants be released on bail, on such termsand conditions the Special Court may consider fit \u2013 Conditions tobe imposed, enumerated \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 ss. 121, 121A, 124A,153A, 505(1)(b), 117, 120B r/w 34 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 21 \u2013 National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 \u2013 Bail.Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 \u2013 s.15(1)(a)-(c) \u2013When not attracted \u2013 Held: In none of the materials which havebeen referred to by the prosecution, the acts specified to in subclause(a) of s.15(1) can be attributed to the appellants \u2013 Nor thereis any allegation against them which would attract sub-clause (c)of s.15(1) \u2013 Further, mere holding of certain literatures throughwhich violent acts may be propagated would not ipso facto attractthe provisions of s.15(1)(b) \u2013 Thus, prima facie, there is no caseagainst the appellants u/s.15(1) (b).Unlawful Activit ies (Prevention) Act, 1967 \u2013 s.20 \u2013Interpretation given to s.20 by Bombay High Court in Dr. AnandTeltumbde vs. National Investigation Agency and Another case fortesting as to who would be a member of terrorist gang or

Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 \u2013 s.2(k), 2(m), 15\u2013 Held: \u201cTerrorist act\u201d as defined u/s.2(k) carries the meaningassigned to it in s.15 \u2013 This Section also stipulates that theexpressions \u201cterrorism\u201d and \u201cterrorist\u201d shall be construedaccordingly \u2013 This implies construction of these two expressions inthe same way as has been done in s.15 \u2013 \u201cterrorist organisation\u201dhas been independently defined in s.2(m) \u2013 But so far as the word\u201cterrorist\u201d is concerned, in this Section also, the interpretationthereof would be relatable to the same expression as used in s.15 \u2013An expression used in different parts of a statute shall ordinarilyconvey the same meaning unless contrary intention appears fromdifferent parts of the same enactment itself \u2013 No such contraryintention is found in the 1967 Act \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes.Bail \u2013 Duty of the Court \u2013 Held: There is a duty of the Courtto form an opinion on perusal of the case diary or the report madeu/s.173, CrPC that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusations against such persons are prima facie true whileconsidering the prayer for bail, to reject prayers for bail of theappellants \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.173 \u2013 CriminalLaw.Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 \u2013 ss.38, 20 \u2013Offence relating to membership of a terrorist organisation \u2013 Held:To bring within the scope of s.38, it would not be sufficient todemonstrate that one is an associate or someone who professes tobe associated with a terrorist organisation \u2013 But there must beintention to further the activities of such organisation on the partof the person implicated under such provision \u2013 The same line ofreasoning in respect of membership of a terrorist organisation u/s.20, ought to apply in respect of an alleged offender implicated ins.38 \u2013 There must be evidence of there being intention to be involvedin a terrorist act \u2013 So far as the appellants are concerned, at thisstage there is no such evidence which can be relied on.Bail \u2013 Prima facie \u201ctest\u201d \u2013 Held: It would not satisfy the primafacie \u201ctest\u201d unless there is at least surface-analysis of probativevalue of the evidence, at the stage of examining the question ofgranting bail and the quality or probative value satisfies the Courtof its worth \u2013 Criminal Law.Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 \u2013 ss.38, 39, 43D(5) \u2013 \u201cintention to further activities\u201d \u2013 Held: The interpretationgiven to the phrase \u201cintention to further activities\u201d of terroristorganisation could also apply in the same way in relation to s.39 \u2013In the present case,

sections \u2013 Jurisdiction of Constitutional Court \u2013 Held: Abail restricting clause cannot denude the jurisdiction of a Constitutional Court in testing if continued detention in a givencase would breach the concept of liberty enshrined in Article 21,would apply in a case where such a bail-restricting clause is beinginvoked on the basis of materials with prima facie low-probativevalue or quality \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Article 21 \u2013 CriminalLaw.Criminal Law \u2013 Stringent provisions of a statute \u2013Interpretation of \u2013 Held: When the statutes have stringent provisions,the duty of the Court would be more onerous \u2013 Graver the offence,greater should be the care taken to see that the offence would fallwithin the four corners of the Act \u2013 Unlawful

Kerala State ElectricityBoard, Supreme Court examined such circumstances and held thatthe creation of a charge need not necessarily be based on an expressprovision of the 2003 Act or plenary legislation, but could be createdby properly framed regulations authorized under the parent statute\u2013 Thus, in the present case, PVVNL rightly argued that by virtue ofClause 4.3(f)(iv) of the Supply Code, read with the stipulations inthe agreement between the parties, a charge was created on theassets of the corporate debtor \u2013 Order of the NCLT also revealsthat this position was accepted \u2013 This is evident from the order ofthe NCLAT which clarified that PVVNL also came under thedefinition of \u2018secured operational creditor\u2019 as per law \u2013 This findingwas affirmed by the impugned order \u2013 Therefore, the conclusionthat PVVNL is a secured creditor cannot be disputed \u2013 Electricity.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 ss.52, 53(1)(e), (f)\u2013 Government debts, operational debts vis-\u00e0-vis dues owed to unsecured financial creditors\u2013Rationale for placing securedcreditors who relinquish their security, higher in priority\u2013 Held:The priority of claims, indicated in the hierarchy of preferences,under the waterfall mechanism accords government debts [clause(e)] and operational debts [clause (f)] lower priority than duesowed to unsecured financial creditors \u2013 Further, debts owed to asecured creditor, whenever such secured creditor \u201chas relinquishedsecurity in the manner set out in s. 52\u201d receive a fairly high priority(immediately after insolvency resolution process costs) \u2013 When thesecured creditor does not relinquish security, the priority of claim islower [s.53(1)(e)(ii)] in respect of \u201cany amount unpaid followingthe enforcement of security interest\u201d \u2013 Amounts due to thegovernment (i.e., payable into the Consolidated Fund of India orConsolidated Fund of a State) are ranked in the same manner asthose of secured creditors who do not relinquish their security interest[s.53(1)(e)(ii)]\u2013 Aforesaid rationale discussed.Electricity Act, 2003 \u2013 ss.50, 56, 181(2)(x) \u2013 Uttar PradeshElectricity Supply Code, 2005 \u2013 Clause 4.3 (f) (iv), Clause 6.15 \u2013Recovery mechanism under\u2013 Discussed\u2013 Uttar Pradesh GovernmentElectrical Undertakings (Dues Recovery) Act, 1958.Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.53(1)(f) \u2013Constitution of India \u2013 Article 265 \u2013 \u201cgovernment dues\u201d \u2013 Held:Dues payable or requiring to be credited to the Treasury, such astax, tariffs, etc. which broadly fall within the ambit of Article 265are \u2018government dues\u2019 and therefore covered by s.53(1)(f) \u2013 Whereas,dues payable to statutory corporations which do not fall within thedescription \u201camounts due to the central or state government\u201d forinstance amounts payable to corporations created by statutes whichhave distinct juristic entity but whose dues do not constitutegovernment dues payable or those payable into the respectiveConsolidated Funds stand on a different footing.Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 ss.77, 78, 3(31) \u2013 Plea of the liquidatorthat without registration of charge u/s.77, the same wasunenforceable under liquidation proceedings \u2013 Held: s.78 enactsthat when a company whose property is subject to charge, fails toregister it, the charge holder (or the person entitled to the chargeover the company\u2019s assets) can seek its registration \u2013 s.3(31) defines\u201csecurity interest\u201d in the widest terms \u2013 Liquidator cannot urge this aspect at this stage, because of the concurrent findings of the NCLTand the NCLAT that PVVNL is a secured creditor \u2013 Further, on facts,it is not appropriate to rule on the submissions of the liquidator vis\u00e0-vis the fact of non-registration of charges u/s.77.Interpretation of Statutes \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,2016 \u2013 Gujarat Value Added Tax Act, 2003\u2013Held: When anenactment uses two different expressions, they cannot be construedas having the same meaning \u2013 Reliance on Rainbow Papers case isof no avail to the appellant and that judgment is to be confined toits own facts."
