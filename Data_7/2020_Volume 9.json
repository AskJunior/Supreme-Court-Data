and such recommendations ofthe committee were accepted by the Full Court of the High Court \u2013In the given fact situation and the methodology of gradualimplementation adopted by the High Court, the suggestion on thepart of the appellant that there had been any so-called retrospectiveoperation of revised criteria was totally bereft of substance \u2013 Inview of the duties and responsibilities attached with the higher postsof District and Sessions Judge and Principal Judge, Family Court,the High Court cannot be faulted in providing for a reasonablemethod of assessment of the requisite merit in the manner that acandidate in the zone of consideration ought to be possessingminimum five \u201cvery good\u201d ACRs in the preceding five years fromthe base year \u2013 In fact, the criteria so adopted had been the identicalone as provided for the members of IAS in the equivalent pay scales\u2013 High Court did not change the eligibility criteria for appointmentto the post of District and Session Judge or Principal Judge, FamilyCourt but merely evolved a selection criteria for evaluation of eligiblecandidates \u2013 There was no denial of a pre-existing right of theappellant, who entered the zone of consideration only in the year2014-15 whereas, the criteria in question was implemented forappointments made from the year 2012.Delhi Higher Judicial Service Rules, 1970: r.27 \u2013 Whetherthe appellant was denied fair and reasonable consideration of hercase for promotion to the posts of District and Sessions Judge/Principal judge, Family Court by operation of criteria laid down inthe impugned resolutions \u2013 Held: Appellant was a member of DHJS\u2013 By virtue of r.27, she would be deemed to be having constructiveknowledge that the criteria to be adopted for upward progressionwould be that as applicable for the equivalent posts in IAS \u2013 Whenit had consistently been provided that for promotion to the scale ofRs. 18,400-22,400 and above, the prescribed benchmark of \u201cverygood\u201d ought to be met in all ACRs of five years under consideration;and when the higher posts of District and Sessions Judge andPrincipal Judge, Family Court do carry much higher scales of pay,neither the High Court could be faulted in applying the samebenchmark for such higher posts in DHJS nor the appellant couldfeign ignorance about the same \u2013 Apart from that in the 1970 Rules,the entry level promotion to the post in DHJS is on the basis ofmerit-cum-seniority or merit \u2013 In the light of such requirements, anyupward progression in DHJS could only be on the higherrequirements of merit and in any case, such requirements cannot belesser than the requirements at entry level \u2013 Appellant was consciousof the fact that for upward movement in DHJS, merit would acquireprimacy; and that seniority alone was not going to be decisive forpromotion to the higher posts of District and Sessions Judge andthe Principal Judge, Family Court \u2013 Appellant was also consciousof the position that while making any such promotion, the assessmentwould be based on the competitive merit of the candidates in thezone of consideration; and if any candidate in such zone ofconsideration was possessed of better merit than herself, he wouldbe preferred for promotion \u2013 Thus, appellant was not denied fairand reasonable consideration of her case for promotion to the postsof District and Sessions Judge/ Principal Judge, Family Court byoperation of the criteria laid down in the impugned resolutions.Judicial Officer \u2013 ACR grading \u2013 Whether the appellantsuffered any prejudice in the matter of ACR grading \u2013 It is not indispute that the appellant was informed of every grading made inher ACR \u2013 She was awarded \u2018B+\u2019 (good) in the years 2010, 2011,2012 and 2013; and \u2018A\u2019 (very good) in the year 2014 \u2013 Materialplaced on record showed that the appellant never challenged hergradings for any year except that for the year 2011 when sherequested for upgradation of her ACR grading from \u2018B\u2019 to \u2018B+\u2019 or\u2018A\u2019; and the High Court, acceding to her request, upgraded herACR to \u2018B+\u2019 \u2013 Impugned resolution dated 27.01.2011 came to beadopted after due consideration of the representations made to theHigh Court and in conformity with the criteria provided by theGovernment of India for the posts equivalent in scale to that ofDistrict Judges \u2013 However, the criteria of having \u2018A\u2019 (very good)grading in the preceding five years was implemented in a phasedmanner \u2013 Appellant, not being oblivious of the position that for anyupward progression in DHJS, comparative merit would be a keyfactor, chose to remain contented with her grading at \u2018B+\u2019 in therelevant years and did not question the same at the appropriatetime and in appropriate manner \u2013 That being the position, theappellant cannot be acceded the right to contend now and at thisstage that the ACR gradings have operated adverse to her \u2013 Whileraising grievance with regard to the impact and effect of ACRgradings, the appellant appears to have missed out the fundamentalfactor that for the promotions in question, an individual\u2019s minimummerit, by itself, was not going to be decisive; but the relevant factorwas going to be comparative merit of the persons in the zone ofconsideration \u2013 That being the position, when the persons in zoneof consideration possessing \u2018A\u2019 (very good) grading have beenpromoted in preference to her, the appellant cannot raise a grievanceabout her gradings after such promotions \u2013 Appellant was not ableto establish that she had suffered any prejudice in the matter ofACR gradings."

Banerjee& Ors. v. H.D. Dubey & Ors., wherein the matter was remandedback to the trial Magistrate to inquire into the question whether thenomination forms nominating appellant and one another personwere received and acknowledged by the Local (Health) Authority \u2013In terms of the said directions, the trial Court passed an orderabsolving the directors of the Company and prosecution was orderedto continue against the appellant/nominated officer \u2013 Thereafter,the trial Court in 2015, convicted the appellant under variousprovisions of the 1954 Act \u2013 There was no order passed by the trialCourt to convict the Company of any offence \u2013 In an appeal, theAdditional Sessions Judge affirmed the conviction of the appellant\u2013 However, the High Court in its order noticed that if the Companyis acquitted of the charges, the said benefit will also directly go tothe appellant \u2013 Thus, the conviction and sentence passed againstthe appellant, being a nominated person of the Company was setaside and the matter was remitted back to the trial Court for passingthe fresh judgment \u2013 Before the Supreme Court, the appellant soughtbenefit under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 which cameafter the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 was repealed \u2013Held: In the 2006 Act, the repeal and saving clause contained ins.97(1)(iii) and (iv) specifically provides that repeal of the Act shallnot affect any investigation or remedy in respect of any such penalty,forfeiture or punishment and the punishment may be imposed, \u201casif the 2006 Act had not been passed\u201d \u2013 Thus, in view of s.97 of the2006 Act, as also u/s.6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, theproceedings would continue under the 1954 Act \u2013 No benefit canbe taken under the 2006 Act as the prosecution and punishmentunder the 1954 Act is protected \u2013 As far as the course adopted bythe High Court to remand the matter to the trial Court is concerned,there is no material distinction between s.141 of the NegotiableInstruments Act, 1882 and s.17 of the 1954 Act which makes thecompanies as well as the nominated person to be held guilty of theoffences and/or liable to be proceeded and punished accordingly \u2013Clauses (a) and (b) of s.17 are not in alternative but in conjoint \u2013Therefore, in the absence of the Company, the nominated personcannot be convicted or vice-versa \u2013 Since the Company was notconvicted by the trial Court, the finding of the High Court to revisitthe judgment will be unfair to the appellant/nominated person whohas been facing trial for more than last 30 years \u2013 The failure ofthe trial Court to convict the Company renders the entire convictionof the nominated person as unsustainable \u2013 Thus, the order passedby the High Court is set aside."

AConstitution of India: Power of Governor to take decisionsas to whether the resignations tendered by Members were genuineor a Member of the House has incurred a disqualification \u2013 Held:The Governor does not decide whether the resignations that weresubmitted by the Members were genuine and voluntary \u2013 That issquarely a matter which lies within the domain of the Speaker \u2013Similarly, whether a Member of the House has incurred adisqualification under the Tenth Schedule is a matter where theSpeaker is the designated authority \u2013 It is trite law that neither theGovernor, nor for that matter this court, has the power to impingeupon the authority of the Speaker to take a decision on these issues. BConstitution of India: Holding of a trust vote \u2013 The holdingof a trust vote operates in a distinct field from the issue as to whetherone or more individual members of the Legislative Assembly haveembarked upon a voluntary act of resignation or have incurred thewrath of the Tenth Schedule \u2013 Holding a trust vote is necessary toascertain whether the Council of Ministers headed by the ChiefMinister has the confidence of the House \u2013 The continuous existenceof that confidence is crucial to the legitimacy and hence survival ofthe government \u2013 Particularly where the Members resigned in anexpression of a lack of faith in the existing government, theconvening of a floor test is the surest method of assessing the impactof the resignations on the collective will of the House \u2013 Thus, theconvening of a trust vote is of crucial importance to affirm thefundamental values of the Constitution namely, abiding by the ruleswhich govern a parliamentary democracy \u2013 Holding of a trust votedoes not short-circuit the jurisdiction of the Speaker on a matter ofresignation and disqualification \u2013 The court cannot issue a directionmandating that a trust vote cannot be convened if any one or moreMembers do not remain present in the House \u2013 Whether or not toremain present is for the individual Members to decide and theywould, necessarily be accountable for the decisions which they take,both to their political party and to their constituents."

VIII(b) of theCovenant preserved the administrative right of the ruler ofTravancore in respect of the Sree Padmanabhswamy temple \u2013 TheConstitution of India made certain provisions with regard to privypurse payable to the rulers in terms of any Covenant entered intoby the ruler of the State \u2013 Soon after the coming into force of theConstitution, the Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious InstitutionsAct, 1950 was enacted and Chapter III of Part-I of the samecomprising of Sections 18 to 23 deals specifically with SriPadmnabhaswamy temple \u2013 Then came the Constitution (Twenty SixthAmendment) Act, 1971 which deleted Arts. 291 and 362 and insertedArt. 363A which now expressly stipulates, inter-alia, that any personwho was recognised as ruler or successor, and all rights, liabilitiesand obligation in respect of Privy purses stand extinguished \u2013 On19.07.1991, the ruler who had executed the Covenant passed away\u2013 Since then, the appellant no. 1, younger brother of the deceasedruler had been exercising all the functions as \u2018Ruler of Travancore\u2019with respect to the affairs of the temple \u2013 A writ petition was filed bya advocate before the High Court to issue a writ of quo warrantodirecting appellant no. 2, the Executing Officer (appointed by theruler of Travancore as per covenant) to show the authority underwhich he was holding the post of Executing Officer of the temple \u2013Thereafter, another writ petition was filed by the appellants referringto the relevant Articles of the Covenant \u2013 Also, there were civil suitspending, which challenged the authority of the appellants hereinwith the affairs of the temple \u2013 Whether the appellant no.1-youngerbrother of the last ruler of Travancore could after the death of thelast ruler on 19.07.1991 claim to be the \u2018ruler of Travancore\u2019 withinthe meaning of the term contained in s.18(2) of the 1950 Act toclaim ownership, control and management of the SreePadmanabhaswamy Temple \u2013 The High Court held that neitherappellant no. 1 nor any of the successors of his family can claimcontrol or management of the temple u/s. 18(2) of the 1950 Act andthe State Government was directed to constitute a body corporateor trust or other legal authority to take control of the temple \u2013Aggrieved, the appellants filed appeal before the Supreme Court \u2013Held: The Supreme Court has laid down that when the idol isinstalled and the temple is constructed or an endowment is founded,the shebaitship is vested in the founder and unless the founder himselfhas disposed of the shebaitship in a particular manner or there issome usage or custom or circumstances showing a different modeof devolution, the shebaitship like any other species of heritableproperty follows the line of inheritance from the founder, and it isnot open to the Court to lay down a new rule of succession or alterthe rule of succession \u2013 In the instant case, the shebaitship or themanagership of the temple passed on to the succeeding kings, comingfrom the royal family of Travancore and represented a continuousand unbroken line of successive shebaits from the original founder\u2013 The Art. VIII of the Covenant acknowledged and accepted in thelatter part of Sub-Article (b) of Art. VIII of the covenant that theadministration in respect of the temple was already vested in theruler of the Covenanting State of Travancore \u2013 Therefore, when theCovenant was entered into by the Ruler of the Covenanting State ofTravancore, apart from other incidents which normally follow therulership, he was holding the office of Shebait of the Temple andrepresented a continuous and unbroken line of successive Shebaitstraced from the original founder \u2013 Insofar as the Constitution(Twenty Sixth Amendment) Act, 1971 is concerned, despite thisamendment, the private properties of the ruler would continue to beavailable for normal succession and devolution in accordance withthe law and custom \u2013 Though the concepts such as Ruler or Rulershiphave ceased to operate, succession to the Gaddi as an incident maystill operate \u2013 So, the Constitution (Twenty Sixth Amendment) Act,1971 did not affect the administration of the temple \u2013 Therefore,the death of the last ruler who signed the Covenant would not inany way affect the Shebaitship of the Temple held by the royal familyof Travancore, that after such death, the shebaitship must devolvein accordance with the applicable law and custom appearing inChapter III Part-I of the 1950 Act must include his natural successorsaccording to law and customs.Travancore-Cochin Hindu Religious Institutions Act, 1950 \u2013Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple \u2013 Constitution of AdministrativeCommittee and Advisory Committee \u2013 A Note was given by theappellants about the composition an Administrative Committee andan Advisory Committee to take care of the affairs of the Temple \u2013 Itwas suggested, inter-alia, that the Administrative Committee shallconsist of five members: a) a retired Indian Administrative ServiceOfficer of the rank of Secretary to Government of Kerala to benominated by the Trustee in consultation with Government of Keralawho shall be the Chairperson of the Committee; (b) one membernominated by the trustee; (c) one member nominated by theGovernment of Kerala; (d) one member nominated by the Ministryof Culture, Government of India; and (e) the Chief Thantri of thetemple \u2013 Held: The suggestions made by the appellants in their Notewith regard to the constitution of the Administrative Committee andthe Advisory Committee is accepted subject to the modification withrespect to the Chairperson of the Administrative Committee \u2013 A minorchange in the Administrative Committee is made \u2013 Instead of a retiredIndian Administrative Service Officer of the rank of Secretary tothe Government of Kerala as the Chairperson of the AdministrativeCommittee, in the interest of justice, the District Judge,Thiruvananthapuram shall be the Chairperson of the AdministrativeCommittee.Words and Phrases :\u2018Shebait\u2019 \u2013 meaning of \u2013 The expressionShebait is derived from \u201cSewa\u201d which means service and shebait,in literal sense, means one who renders \u201csewa\u201d to the idol or adeity."
