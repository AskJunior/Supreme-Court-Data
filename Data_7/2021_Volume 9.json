Act \u2013 Judicial Magistrate, first class (JMFC) convicted respondent and sentenced him to undergo simple imprisonment for 6 months and to pay fine of Rs.2,00,000/- \u2013 The appeals filed before the Sessions Judge were dismissed \u2013 Before the High Court, the respondent contended that a relative of the appellant was junior in the office of his advocate and due to such dominant position, the respondent was made to sign on the agreement and the cheque though the money was not paid \u2013 Proceeding on the basis of this contention, the High Court set aside the conviction of the respondent \u2013 On appeal, held: Since the signature on the agreement and more particularly the dishonored cheque was not disputed, the presumption as provided in law u/ss. 118 and 139 of the N.I. Act had arisen \u2013 Such presumption would remain till it is rebutted \u2013 The contention of the respondent that a relative of the appellant was the junior of his advocate and he has used his dominant position to secure thesignature on the cheque, has absolutely no explanation whatsoever to indicate the reason for which such necessity arose for him to secure the signatures of the respondent, if there was no transaction whatsoever between the parties \u2013 That apart, the said story was put forth for the first time before the High Court \u2013 The respondent had not replied to the notice intimating dishonor of cheque and put forth such contention \u2013 It was neither raised before the JMFC nor before the Sessions Judge \u2013 Further, there is no explanation as to why such an advocate was engaged by the respondent to defend himself, whose junior had used his dominant position to secure his signatures, in the same case relating to dishonor of cheque \u2013 Also, it is difficult to comprehend as to why a cheque of lesser amount Rs.1,50,000/- was secured than full amount of Rs.3,50,000/-, if there was use of dominant position by junior advocate \u2013 Keeping all these aspects in view, the case put forth by the respondent does not satisfy the requirement of rebuttal even if tested on touchstone of preponderance of probability \u2013 The High Court was not justified in its conclusion \u2013 The order of conviction by JMFC is confirmed \u2013 However, the sentence is modified, the respondent sentenced to pay fine of Rs.2,50,000/- only."

Deptt. for getting the plots illegally \u2013 On appeal, held: The High Court has entered into the merits of the allegations and has conducted the mini-trial by weighing the evidence in detail which, as such, as observed and held by the Supreme Court in its various decisions is wholly impermissible \u2013 Looking to the allegations in the present case against the respondents-accused and considering the fact that charge-sheet was filed by the Vigilance Cell after a thorough investigation, it cannot be said that the case falls within any of the exceptions as carved out by this Court in the case of Bhajan Lal \u2013 The allegations against the respondents-accused are very of serious nature, as there are specific allegations with respect to huge loss caused to the BDA and the public exchequer, as according to the prosecution the plots were allotted at throw away prices \u2013 All these aspects are required to be considered at the stage of trial and not while considering the application u/s.482 Cr.P.C. \u2013 Thus, the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Courtquashing the criminal proceedings against the respondent-accused no.3,4 and 5 is quashed and set aside.

Public Property \u2013 Allotment of plots \u2013 Held: Government and/ or the public authorities like B.D.A. are the custodian of public properties \u2013 Allotment of public properties must be transparent and has to be fair and non-arbitrary \u2013 In such matters, public interest only has to be the prime guiding consideration \u2013 In order to get the best or maximum price so that it may serve the public purpose and public interest so as to avoid loss to the authority and/or the public exchequer \u2013 The allotment of plots in the discretionary quota cannot be at the whims of the persons in power and/or the public servants who are dealing with the allotment of plots in the discretionary quota."

Judicial notice: Under the scheme of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008, the power is vested with the Central Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, for the trial of scheduled offences, to designate one or more Courts of Session as Special Courts \u2013 s.19 of the Act 2008 envisages that the trial under the Act of any offence by a Special Court shall be held on day-to-day basis on all working days and shall be concluded in preference to the trial of such other case and accordingly the trial of such other case shall, if necessary, remain in abeyance \u2013 It seems that only one such Special Court has been designated by the State of West Bengal to try such cases under the Act 2008 \u2013 In the instant case, the order sheets indicated that hearing was taking place onlyone day in a month and if this procedure is followed in conducting the trial under Act 2008, it would frustrate the very purpose with which the Special Courts are designated \u2013 State of West Bengal to take up the issue and designate more dedicated courts of Sessions as Special Courts for the trial of offences specified in the schedule appended to the Act 2008 \u2013 At the same time, the Central Government may also, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court, Calcutta may exercise its power and take up the issue at the earliest so that such trials which are pending under the Act 2008 may go ahead speedily and the mandate, as intended by the legislature in its wisdom, reflected from s.19 of the Act, is being complied with in its letter and spirit \u2013 National Investigation Agency Act, 2008."

        "HeadNote": "Service Law \u2013 Kerala Service Rules \u2013 r. 25(a), Part-III \u2013 Benefit under \u2013 Appellant was appointed as a Lecturer at the respondent University with effect from 07.09.1984 \u2013 Prior to such appointment, he was a lawyer practised for eight years \u2013 The appellant made a representation before the Registrar of the respondent University, requesting to reckon his practice of eight years at the Bar for the purpose of determining his pensionary benefits payable to him on his superannuation on the basis of Rule 25 (a), Part III, Kerala Service Rules (KSR) \u2013 Registrar rejected his request and relied on the proviso to Rule 25 (a), Part III, KSR which provides that the benefit u/Rule 25 (a) would be available only to such employees who are recruited when practising at the Bar, to those posts requiring a qualification in law and experience at the Bar \u2013 The experience at the Bar was not essential for appointment in the instant case \u2013 The Chancellor also dismissed the appeal petition \u2013 Writ petition filed by the appellant before the High Court was dismissed \u2013 Before the Supreme Court, the appellant contended that in the case of one \u2018Dr. PLK\u2019, a Professor of Law who was similarly situated as the appellant, the respondent University duly considered the period of practice at the Bar as a part of \u2018Dr. PLK\u2019 qualifying service for the purpose of determining pension payable on his superannuation \u2013 Held: The appellant and Dr. PLK were in fact similarly situated \u2013 Both these individuals were appointed as teaching faculty at the respondent University after practicing as advocates in various Courts \u2013 They were both appointed before the proviso to Rule 25 (a) came into effect, i.e. before 12.02.1985 and retired after the said proviso came into force \u2013 There are no valid grounds to sustain the application of the proviso in relation to the appellant \u2013 The action of the respondent University of selectivelyapplying the proviso to Rule 25(a) in relation to the appellant, while not applying the said proviso in relation to similarly situated persons, is arbitrary and therefore illegal \u2013 Therefore, the appellant is entitled to receive pension having regard to his total qualifying service, inclusive of the period of his service at the respondent University and the period of his practice as an Advocate in various Courts of the State."

Act of 2016 \u2013 Retrospective or retroactive in its operation \u2013 Held: Application of the Act is retroactive in character and it cannot be said to be violative of either Art. 14 or 19(1)(g) \u2013 Intention of the legislature by necessary implication and without any ambiguity is to include those projects which were ongoing and in cases where completion certificate has not been issued within fold of the Act \u2013 Projects already completed or to which the completion certificate has been granted are not under its fold \u2013 At the same time, it would apply after getting the on-going projects and future projects registered u/s. 3 to prospectively follow the mandate of the Act \u2013 ss. 3(1), 13, 18(1) and 19(4) \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 14, 19(1)(g).ss. 12, 14, 18, 19 and 71 \u2013 Return/refund of the amount to allottee \u2013 Jurisdiction of, regulatory authority or adjudicating officer \u2013 Held: There is a complete delineation of the jurisdiction vested with the regulatory authority and the adjudicating officer \u2013 A conjoint reading of ss. 18 and 19 clearly manifests that when it comes to refund of the amount, and interest thereon, it is the regulatory authority which has the power to examine and determine the outcome of a complaint \u2013 When it comes to seeking the relief of adjudging compensation and interest thereon, the adjudicating officer exclusively has the power to determine, keeping in view the collective reading of s.71 r/w s.72 \u2013 If the adjudication u/ss. 12, 14, 18 and 19 other than compensation as envisaged, if extended to the adjudicating officer as prayed that, may intend to expand the ambit and scope of the powers and functions of the adjudicating officer u/s. 71 and that would be against the mandate of the Act 2016. s. 81 \u2013 Delegation of power to single member of the authority to hear complaint instituted u/s. 31 \u2013 Permissibility of \u2013 Held: Is permissible \u2013 s. 81 positively empowers the authority to delegate such of its powers and functions to one of its member by general or special order subject to s. 85 \u2013 It cannot said to be dehors the mandate of law.s. 43(5) proviso \u2013 Condition of pre-deposit for filing appeal \u2013 Sustainability of \u2013 Held: Is sustainable in law \u2013 Obligation is cast upon the promoter of pre-deposit u/s. 43(5), being a class in itself, and the promoters are in receipt of money which is being claimed by the home buyers/allottees for refund and determined in the first place by the competent authority \u2013 Intention of the legislature was to ensure that money once determined by the authority be saved if appeal is to be preferred at the instance of the promoter after due compliance of pre-deposit as envisaged u/s. 43(5) \u2013 Thus, it cannot said to be onerous or in violation of Arts. 14 or 19(1)(g) of the Constitutions. 40(1) \u2013 Issuance of recovery certificates for recovery of principle amount under \u2013 Power of the authority \u2013 Held: Power of authority to direct the refund of the principal amount is explicit in s. 18 and the interest that is payable is on the principal amount \u2013 There is no interest in the absence of a principal amount beingdetermined by the competent authority \u2013 Statute as such is read to mean that the principal sum with interest has become a composite amount quantified upon to be recovered as arrears of land revenue u/s. 40(1) \u2013 There appears some ambiguity in s. 40(1) and by harmonising the construction of the scheme of the Act with the right of recovery as mandated in s. 40(1), it is made clear that the amount which has been determined and refundable to the allottees/home buyers either by the authority or the adjudicating officer in terms of the order is recoverable within the ambit of s. 40(1). A B Object and reasons of the Act \u2013 Explained. Interpretation of Statutes: Retroactive statute \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: Retroactive statute means a statute which creates a new obligation on transactions or considerations already passed or destroys or impairs vested rights \u2013 Statute is not retrospective merely because it affects existing rights or its retrospection because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to its passing"

Act \u2013 A criminal complaint was filed by the second respondent \u2013 Magistrate issued summons to the appellants \u2013 The accused persons in the present case resided at Aurangabad while the complaint u/s. 138 was filed before the Magistrate in Mundra \u2013 The argument of the appellants is that in these circumstances, the Magistrate was duty bound to postpone the issuance of process and to either enquire into the case himself or to direct an investigation either by a police officer or by some other person \u2013 It was further contended that the summoning order showed non-application of mind \u2013 Held: Under Sub-Section (1) of s.202, a Magistrate upon the receipt of a complaint of an offence of which he/she is authorized to take cognizance is empowered topostpone the issuance of process against the accused and either (i) enquire into the case; or (ii) direct an investigation to be made by a police officer or by such other person as he thinks fit \u2013 If the Magistrate holds an inquiry himself, it is not compulsory that he should examine witnesses and in suitable cases the Magistrate can examine documents to be satisfied that there are sufficient grounds for proceeding u/s. 202 \u2013 In the present case, the Magistrate has adverted to: (i) The complaint; (ii) The affidavit filed by the complainant; (iii) The evidence as per evidence list and; and (iv) The submissions of the complainant \u2013 The order passed by the Magistrate cannot be held to be invalid as betraying a non- application of mind \u2013 As it is settled that in determining the question as to whether process is to be issued, the Magistrate has to be satisfied whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding and not whether there is sufficient ground for conviction."

Limitation: Statutes of limitation \u2013 Nature of \u2013 Held: Is generally regarded as procedural as its object is not to create any right but prescribe periods within which legal proceedings should be instituted for enforcement of rights or adjudication orders should be passed \u2013 Statutes of limitation have retrospective effect insofar as they apply to all legal proceedings brought after they come into force \u2013 However, the laws relating to limitation have been held to be prospective since they do not have the effect of reviving the right of action which is already barred on the date of their coming into operation, nor do they have the effect of extinguishing a right of action subsisting on the date \u2013 Thus, unless the language of the provision dealing with period of limitation clearly manifests, in express terms or by necessary implication, a contrary intention divesting vested rights, such provision is to be construed as prospective. General Clauses Act, 1897: s. 6 \u2013 Effect of repeal \u2013 Discussed. Interpretation of statutes: Retrospective application of statutes \u2013 Constitution Bench decision in Indore Development Authority\u2019s case holding that extent of retrospectivity would also depend upon the degree of unfairness it causes to the parties \u2013 Absence of express limiting words is not to be used as a basis for implying retrospective operation as this would be reverse of the true presumption \u2013 However, presumption in favour of retrospectivity may be necessary when distinct implications typically arise in the context of the statute which repeals a previous statute, and would leave a \u2018lacuna\u2019 if the new statute were not construed as having retrospective effect \u2013 Statute which is prospective in its direct operation cannot be called as retrospective because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from time antecedent to its passing \u2013 Furthermore, for interpretation, a construction which results in unreasonably harsh and absurd results must be avoided."
