        "HeadNote": "Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.83, 85, as amended by Amendment Act 27 of 2013 \u2013 Suit for permanent injunction in respect of a waqf property filed before civil court, if maintainable \u2013 Held: Words in s.83(1) \u201cany dispute, question or other matter relating to a waqf or waqf property\u201d cover any dispute, question or other matter relating to a waqf property \u2013 Court cannot do violence to the express language of the statute \u2013 s.83(1) even as it stood before the amendment, provided for the determination by the Waqf Tribunal, of any dispute, question or other matter relating to a waqf and a waqf property \u2013 Therefore, to say that the Tribunal will have jurisdiction only if the subject property is disputed to be a waqf property and not if it is admitted to be a waqf property, is indigestible in the teeth of s.83(1) \u2013 Dichotomy created in some decisions of Supreme Court, between the properties admitted to be waqf properties and disputed to be so, is on account of the misapplication of the two limited questions in ss.6(1) and 7(1) to the whole of the Act including s.83 \u2013 In the present case, the property is admittedly a waqf property \u2013 To allow the respondent-plaintiff to ignore the Waqf Tribunal and to seek a decree of permanent and mandatory injunction from a civil court, would be to ignore the mandate of ss.83 and 85 \u2013 Approach of the High Court not in tune with the law laid down by Supreme Court \u2013 Further, a question as to the nature of the waqf and whether the plaintiff is a beneficiary of the waqf, has also arisen in this case which question has necessarily to be decided by the Tribunal and not the civil court \u2013 Trial court to return the plaint to the plaintiff, for presentation to the jurisdictional Waqf Tribunal \u2013 Judgment of High Court set aside \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.39, r.1 \u2013 Mussalman Waqf Validating Act, 1913 \u2013 Mussalman Waqf Act 1923 \u2013 Waqf Act 1954. Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.85, 86, 89 and 90 \u2013 Bar of jurisdiction u/s.85 \u2013 Held: The 1995 Act makes a specific reference to court/civil Court also in certain places \u2013 ss.86, 90 and 93 make specific reference to \u201cCourt\u201d \u2013 s.68(6) goes a step further by making a reference to \u2018civil court\u2019 \u2013 A cumulative reading of ss.86, 89 and 90 shows that the bar of jurisdiction u/s.85 is not total and omnipotent and there may be cases which could still be entertained by civil courts. Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.83, 85, as amended by Amendment Act 27 of 2013 \u2013 Held: Act 27 of 2013 did 2 things \u2013 First it expanded the jurisdiction of Waqf Tribunal even to cover landlord-tenant disputes and the rights and obligations of lessor and lessee \u2013 Second, it enlarged the bar of jurisdiction, to cover even revenue courts and other authorities. Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.6(1), 7(1) \u2013 Held: By Act 27 of 2013 the words, \u201cany person interested\u201d were substituted by the words, \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d, meaning thereby that even a non Muslim is entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal \u2013 Due to the substitution of the words \u201cany person aggrieved\u201d, Act 27 of 2013 has deleted the Explanation u/s.6(1). Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.83, 85 and 86 \u2013 Special provision u/s.86 \u2013 Held: Dehors the jurisdiction conferred upon the Tribunal u/s.83(1) and dehors the bar of jurisdiction of the civil court, revenue court and any other authority u/s.85, the 1995 Act contains a special provision in s.86 for the appointment by the civil court, of a Receiver, in certain cases \u2013 It is clear from s.86, that in suits or other proceedings instituted by the Board falling u/clause (a) or those instituted by the mutawalli falling u/clause (b) of s.86, the civil court will have jurisdiction to appoint a receiver \u2013 As a corollary, the bar u/s.85 will have no application to cases covered by s.86. Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.83, 85, 86, 90 and 93 \u2013 Question of bar of jurisdiction of the civil court \u2013 Determination of \u2013 Held: In view of the language employed in ss.83 and 85, coupled with the reference to civil courts in ss.86, 90 and 93, it appears that the question of bar of jurisdiction of the civil court, has been left by the law makers to the vagaries of judicial opinion and this has given rise to conflicting decisions. Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 s.83 \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.39, r.1 \u2013 Held: s.83(5) makes it clear that the Waqf Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Civil Court and shall have the same powers as may be exercised by a Civil Court under the CPC, while trying a suit or executing a decree or order \u2013 The Tribunal will have power to issue temporary injunctions u/Or. 39, r.1, CPC. Waqf Act, 1995 \u2013 ss.6, 7 and 85 \u2013 Held: A conjoint reading of ss.6, 7 and 85 would show that the bar of jurisdiction of civil court contained in s.6(5) and s.7(2) is confined to Chapter-II, but the bar of jurisdiction u/s.85 is all pervasive \u2013 Distinguishing features enumerated. Words & Phrases \u2013 \u201cany dispute, question or other matter relating to a waqf or waqf property\u201d in s.83(1) \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Waqf Act, 1995."

Constitution of India \u2013 Art 243R and 243S \u2013 Whether Arts. 243R and Art. 243S of the Constitution of India contains any limitation to the effect that there shall be only one member from one ward \u2013 Held: The constitutional provisions of Art. 243R, which provides for composition of Municipalities and that of Art. 243ZA does not give any indication as to whether from territorial constituency, i.e., the Wards, whether only one member has to be elected in the Municipality or it can be multiple member constituency \u2013 There is no limitation in provision of Art. 243S, which limits the State Legislature for requiring multi-member seats in a Ward \u2013 The only requirement is that a member of the Municipality representing a Ward shall be a member of the Ward Committee \u2013 Thus, constitutional requirement or limitation engrafted in sub-Article(3) of Art. 243S is that a member of the Municipality representing a Ward shall be a member of the Ward Committee, it cannot be read to mean that it mandates that from one Ward more than one members cannot be made representatives. Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 \u2013 ss. 5(3)(iii)(a), 29A \u2013 Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations (the delimitation of wards and allocation of reserved seats) Rules, 1994 \u2013 rr. 4 and 5 \u2013 Gujarat Municipal Corporation\u2019s Ward Committees Functions, Duties, Territorial Areas and Procedure for Transaction of Business Rules, 2007 \u2013 r. 2(b) \u2013 Whether the provisions of ss. 5(3)(iii)(a), 29A of the Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporation Act, 1949 and Rules 4 and 5 of Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporations (the delimitation of wards and allocation of reserved seats) Rules, 1994 and Rule 2(b) of Gujarat Municipal Corporation\u2019s Ward Committees Functions, Duties, Territorial Areas and Procedure for Transaction of Business Rules, 2007 are ultra vires to the provisions of Articles 243R and 243S of the Constitution? \u2013 Held: The composition of Municipality has been dealt separately by Art. 243R and for composition of Municipality, the provisions of Art. 243S cannot be said to be applicable or intended to provide any limitation or prohibition with regard to composition of the Municipalities \u2013 The Rule 2(b) of Rules, 2007 which provides for election of Chairperson, by following which rule, in case of multi- member Ward, Chairperson can be elected, which may apply both to Art. 243S(4) as well as Rule 2(b) of the Rules, 2007 \u2013 Thus, Rules 4 and 5 of Rules, 1994 as well as Rule 2(b) of Rules, 2007 does in no manner disobey the mandate of Art. 243S(4), both can be complied with without any conflict between the two different provisions \u2013 Thus, the provisions of s. 5(3)(iii)(a) as well as Rules 4 and 5 of Rules, 1994 and Rule 2(b) of Rules, 2007 are not inconsistent with provisions of Art. 243R and Art.243S. A The Gujarat Delimitation of Wards and Allocation of Reserved Seats in Municipal Borough Rules, 1994 \u2013 Whether having more than one representative from a Ward negates the empowerment of weaker sections, i.e. women, Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes \u2013 Held: The Gujarat Delimitation of Wards and Allocation of Reserved Seats in Municipal Borough Rules, 1994 has been amended by Amendment Rules, 2015 \u2013 As per clauses 2 and 3, now it is 4 member Ward, 2 seats are to be reserved for women including seats reserved for women belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Back Ward Classes \u2013 The entire purpose and object of reserving seats for weaker sections is to empower the weaker sections, i.e., women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, when there are more numbers are reserved for weaker sections their participation in municipality is bound to increase giving strength to their voice and effective participation which is nothing but empowerment of weaker sections \u2013 By the Rules, 1994 as amended in 2015 now the voice of weaker sections can be felt from every Ward which clearly enhances of presence and participation of weaker sections does not in any manner, negate the empowerment of weaker sections."

Administrative law: Administrative orders \u2013 Principle of natural justice \u2013 Significance of \u2013 Held: Natural justice is an important aspect while viewing the administrative orders \u2013 To maintain rule of law, effective natural justice is to be provided to affected parties, before a decision is taken \u2013 Any attempt by authority to evade the requirement of providing effective hearing before reaching a conclusion, cannot pass the muster."

M. Joseph, J.,: The respondent, as issuing bank, was liable to pay service tax, u/s.68(1), being the service provider \u2013 Being liable to pay tax u/s.68(1), it was also liable to file the return including the amount of interchange fee \u2013 The measure of tax, which is found in s.67(1)(i), is entirely related to the service that the acquiring bank provided and agreed to provide \u2013 Likewise, the value of the service provided by the issuing bank, would be the value of service, for the purpose of s.67(1) \u2013 Therefore, respondent- bank was liable to include interchange fee and file return and pay tax on the same \u2013 It is also clear that Respondent, as issuing bank, provides service within the meaning of s.65(33a)(iii) \u2013 Respondent is paid Rs.2 as interchange fee \u2013 Interchange fee, therefore, is exigible to service tax \u2013 Per S. Ravindra Bhat, J. (dissenting):Respondent-bank, as issuing bank was providing service, as found by the Commissioner \u2013 However, this service was a part of a single unified service \u2013 of settling transactions \u2013 Which is provided by both the acquiring and issuing bank \u2013 Having characterized the service to be a single unified service \u2013 wherein service tax, by way of business convenience, is collected from/ remitted by the acquiring bank on the value (whole MDR which includes the interchange fee that is retained by the issuing bank) taxable for single service rendered by both the acquiring and issuing bank (respondent) cannot be called upon to pay service tax again as this would result in double taxation."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Right of Appellant to terminate Power Purchase Agreement \u2013 Whether the appellant\u2018s right to terminate the PPA in terms of Article 9.2.1(e) read with 9.3.1 is regulated by the IBC \u2013 Held: In accordance with Article 9.3.1 of PPA, the appellant, on the occurrence of an Event of Default u/Article 9.2.1, can issue a default notice which shall specify in reasonable detail the Event of Default giving rise to the default notice, and call upon the Corporate Debtor to remedy it \u2013 At the expiry of 30 days from such notice, unless otherwise agreed, if the default has not been remedied, the appellant can terminate the PPA \u2013 In the instant case, it is the sole contract for the sale of electricity which was entered into by the corporate debtor \u2013 The PPA was terminated solely on the ground of insolvency, which gives the NCLT jurisdiction u/s. 60(5)(c) to adjudicate this matter and invalidate the termination of the PPA \u2013 NCLT is the forum vested with the responsibility of ensuring the continuation of the insolvency resolution process, which requires preservation of the Corporate Debtor as a going concern \u2013 The NCLT/NCLAT correctly stayed the termination of the PPA by the appellant, since allowing it to terminate the PPA would certainly result in the corporate death of the Corporate Debtor due to the PPA being its sole contract. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Textually similar language in different enactments has to be construed in the context and scheme of the statute in which the words appear \u2013 The meaning and content attributed to statutory language in one enactment cannot in all circumstances be transplanted into a distinct, if not, alien soil \u2013 It is trite law that the words of a statute have to be construed in a manner which would give them a sensible meaning which accords with the overall scheme of the statute, the context in which the words are used and the purpose of the underlying provision \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code \u2013 sec. 60(5) \u2013 Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 446(2).

General Clauses Act, 1897: s. 6 \u2013 Effect of repeal under \u2013 Accrual of privilege \u2013 Held: Where a central enactment repeals another enactment, the repeal shall not affect the any legal proceeding or investigation with respect to an accrued right, unless a different intention appears from a repealing statute \u2013 Privilege is accrued only when the privilege holder does an act required to avail the privilege \u2013 It is not the mere hope or expectation of accrual. Constitution of India: Art. 14 \u2013 Right to Equality \u2013 Principle of Reasonable Accommodation \u2013 Held: Is one of the means for achieving substantive equality, pursuant to which disabled individuals must be reasonably accommodated based on their individual capacities \u2013 Disability, as a social construct, precedes the medical condition of an individual, and sense of disability is introduced because of the absence of access to facilities. Interpretation of statutes: Rule of interpretation \u2013 Held: If two interpretation possible, the interpretation which furthers international law or gives effect to international law must be preferred \u2013 Since Art. 5 of the Convention places the States under an obligation to provide both formal and substantive equality, an interpretation of the PwD Act that furthers the principles mentioned in Art. 5 must be undertaken, India being the signatory and having ratified the Convention \u2013 Thus, even though the PwD Act does not have an express provision laying down the general principle of non-discrimination against disabled persons, it must still have to be read in the statute \u2013 United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \u2013 Art. 5 \u2013 Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 \u2013 Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act 1951.

A Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \u2013 s.35(1)(c) \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Sine qua non for invoking s.35(1)(c) is that all consumers on whose behalf or for whose benefit the provision is invoked, should have the same interest \u2013 Interestingly, s.35(1) (c) uses the disjunction \u201cor\u201d in between two sets of words, namely, (i) \u201con behalf of\u201d; and (ii) \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d \u2013 A complaint filed under s.35(1)(c) could either be \u201con behalf of\u201d or \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d all consumers having the same interest \u2013 Or.I r.8, CPC, unlike s.35(1)(c) operates both ways and contains provisions for a two-way traffic \u2013 It not only permits plaintiffs to sue in a representative capacity but also permits people to be sued and to be defended in an action, in a representative capacity \u2013 Since \u201csameness of interest\u201d is the pre- requisite for an application under Or.I r.8, CPC read with s.35(1)(c) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, it was necessary for the respondents to include in the consumer complaint, sufficient averments that would show sameness of interest. D Consumer Protection Act, 2019: s.35(1)(c) \u2013 Sameness of interest \u2013 The period of delay in the completion of project and handing over of possession, does not appear to be uniform in all 1134 cases \u2013 Complainants cannot project sameness of interest for the purchasers in whose case the period of delay was negligible and those in whose cases there was a huge delay. Consumer Protection Act, 1986: Consumer Protection Act, 2019 \u2013 s.12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act or s.35(1)(c) of the 2019 Act \u2013 For allowing an application under s.12(1)(c) of the 1986 Act or s.35(1)(c) of the 2019 Act, the pleadings and the reliefs are to be considered \u2013 If so considered, National Commission could not have granted permission to the respondents in this case, to file the complaint in a representative capacity for and on behalf of the owners of all the 1134 flats. Consumer Protection Act, 2019: s.2(5)(i), s.36(1) \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Consumer \u2013 It is true that s.2(5)(i) uses the expression \u201ca consumer\u201d \u2013 If the vowel \u201ca\u201d and the word \u201cconsumer\u201d appearing in s.2(5)(i) are to be understood to exclude more than one person, it will result in a disastrous consequence while reading s.2(5)(vi) \u2013 s.2(5)(vi) states that in the case of death of a consumer, \u201chis legal heir or legal representative\u201d will be a complainant \u2013 Unless the words \u201clegal heir\u201d and \u201clegal representative\u201d are understood to mean \u2018legal heirs\u2019 and \u2018legal representatives\u2019, a meaningful reading of the provision may not be there \u2013 Under s.13(2) of the General Clauses Act, 1897, words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa in all Central Acts and Regulations, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context \u2013 Anything repugnant cannot be read in the subject or context of s. 2(5) or 35(1)(c) or 38(11) of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 to hold that the word in the singular, namely, \u201cconsumer\u201d will not include the plural \u2013 The proper way of interpreting s.35(1) read with s.2(5), would be to say that a complaint may be filed: (i) by a single consumer; (ii) by a recognised consumer Association; (iii) by one or more consumers jointly, seeking the redressal of their own grievances without representing other consumers who may or may not have the same interest; (iv) by one or more consumers on behalf of or for the benefit of numerous consumers; and (v) the Central Government, Central Authority or State Authority."

        "HeadNote": "Civil Suit: Suit for Recovery of Money \u2013 In the instant case, appellant filed two suits against respondents for recovery of money \u2013 Appellant and respondents are relatives \u2013 In the first suit, respondents borrowed a sum of Rs.10,50,000/- from the appellant by way of a cheque, out of which Rs.5,00,000/- was refunded by respondents and promised to repay the balance within six months but failed to refund \u2013 In the second suit, appellant and her husband joined respondent in his real estate business in which various amounts were either withdrawn from or transferred out of appellant\u2019s accounts by the respondent unauthorisedly amounting to Rs.54,50,000/- \u2013 Trial Court dismissed both the suits \u2013 First appellate court allowed the appeals \u2013 Respondents filed appeals before High Court which were allowed resulting in dismissal of the two money suits \u2013 On appeal, held: In the first suit, the defence set up by the respondents was that the payment of Rs.5,00,000/- made by them was by way of full and final settlement \u2013 However, no receipt and written memorandum of compromise/settlement were taken by respondents from the appellant \u2013 When a party pleads part repayment in full and final settlement of certain some of money, the onus is upon him to show that there was a settlement \u2013 This onus was not discharged by the respondent \u2013 Hence, the appellant entitled to succeed in the first suit \u2013 In the second suit, defence of the respondents was that the amounts represented authorized payments for the purchase and sale of properties in a real estate business and that out of those amounts, a sum of Rs.30,00,000/ was treated as a payment made out of love and affection \u2013 The onus was on defence to show that there were business dealings, however, no books of accounts were produced by the defence to show that the amounts flowed out for business dealings \u2013 If the appellants had treated Rs. 30,00,000/ as one made out of love and affection, there could have been no occasion for dispute requiring mediation, resulting in the payment of Rs.5,00,000/- by respondents to appellant in full and final settlement in an interval of five months \u2013 The only piece of evidence on the basis of which the gratuitous nature of payment is sought to be proved is an affidavit sworn by appellant, but it did not contain the signature of the appellant \u2013 Hence, plea of gratuitous payment was not established by the respondents \u2013 Suit decree."

distance requirement between buildings \u2013 Collusion and illegal construction \u2013 Demolition of two towers \u2013 NOIDA allotted to the appellant a plot of land for the development of a group housing society and sanctioned the building plan for the construction of fourteen towers, each with ground and nine floors (G+9) \u2013 On 05.12.2006, the New Okhla Industrial Development Area Building Regulations and Directions (NBR 2006) were notified \u2013 On 29.12.2006, NOIDA sanctioned the first revised plan by which additional buildings were also sanctioned and two additional floors were envisaged in addition to already sanctioned (G+9) \u2013 Additional buildings were sanctioned, namely (i) Tower-15 (G+11), (ii) Tower-16 (G+11) and (iii) a shopping complex \u2013 In the second revised plan, the earlier T-16 (G+11) was replaced with a T-16 (G+24) and similarly, the shopping complex was replaced with T-17 (G+24) \u2013 T-16 and T-17 would each be of a height of 73 mtrs and according to the plan, T-17 was to be at a distance of 9 mtrs. from T-1 \u2013 In the third revised plan, the height of T-16 and T-17 was permitted to be raised from 24 floors to 40 floors (i.e., G+40), resulting in the building\u2019s height being 121 mtrs. \u2013 The first respondent addressed a communication to NOIDA complaining of violations \u2013 Thereafter, first respondent filed a writ petition in the High Court and sought quashing of revised plan of disputed towers and also prayed that the illegal structure be demolished \u2013 The High Court allowed the writ petition and directed the demolition of T-16 and T-17, with the expenses of the demolition being borne by the appellant and to refund the consideration received from flat purchasers who had booked apartments \u2013 It further directed the Competent Authority to grant sanction for the prosecution of NOIDA\u2019s officials \u2013 On appeal, held: The National Building Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC) concluded that the said two towers are not compliant with Regulation 24.2.1.6 of the NBR 2010 \u2013 The purpose of stipulating a minimum distance between buildings is a matter of public interest in planned development \u2013 The residents who occupy constructed areas in a housing project are entitled to ventilation, light and air and adherence to fire safety norms \u2013 As per Regulation 33.2.3 of the NBR 2006, the minimum distance between T-17 and T-1, should be half of the height of the tallest building, that is, half of the height of T-17 which is 36.5 mtrs \u2013 It is evident from the record that the distance between T-1 and T-17 is 9 mtrs. only, thus, clearly the second revised plan was violative of the NBR 2006 \u2013 In the third revised plan the height of T-16 and T-17 was increased to 121 mtrs. \u2013 In accordance with Regulation 24.2.1.6 of NBR 2010, the spacing between a building of height 121 mtrs. and another building would be 16 mtrs. however, the distance between disputed towers was 9 mtrs. \u2013 Consequently, the third revised plan was in violation of NBR 2010 \u2013 The construction of T-16 and T-17 in accordance with the second revised plan and the third revised plan reduced the value of the undivided interest held by each individual flat owner in the common areas and facilities, thereby violating s.5 of the UP 1975 Act and s.5 of the UP Apartments Act 2010, since the flat owners\u2019 consent was not sought \u2013 Further, the third revised plan encroached upon the garden area in front of T-1, thereby resiling from the representation that was made to the flat owners at the time when they purchased the apartments in T-1, without their consent \u2013 Therefore, it constituted a violation of s.4(1) r/w. the proviso to s.4(4) of the UP Apartments Act 2010 \u2013 The case has revealed a nefarious complicity of the planning authority in the violation by the developer of the provisions of law \u2013 NOIDA made no effort to ensure compliance of the UP Apartments Act 2010, as a result of which the rights of the flat purchasers was brazenly violated \u2013 The illegal construction of T-16 and T-17 was achieved through acts of collusion between the officers of NOIDA and the appellant and its management \u2013 The High Court has correctly come to the conclusion that there was collusion between the developer and the planning authority \u2013 Therefore, the directions of the High Court including the order of demolition and for sanctioning prosecution against the officials of the appellant and the officers of NOIDA for violations of the UPIAD Act 1976 and UP Apartments Act 2010 is confirmed \u2013 National Building Regulations 2010 \u2013 Regulation 24.2.1.6 \u2013 Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, 1976 \u2013 sec. 12 \u2013 Uttar Pradesh Urban Development Act, 1973 \u2013 sec. 49 \u2013 Uttar Pradesh Ownership of Flats Act 1975 \u2013 ss. 3(d), 5.

Union of India (2019) 3 SCC 641: \u2013 (ii) Regulation 18 (which provides for the requirement of Board\u2019s fresh authorization to the entities that were carrying out CGD activities prior to the coming into effect of PNGRB Act, who were not authorized by central government) gave arbitrary power to the Board in granting authorization and it is ultra-vires to the PNGRB Act \u2013 (iii) Exclusion of the disputed areas from authorization was unjustified \u2013 Held: (i) Deemed authorization clause under proviso to s. 16 is subjected to other provisions \u2013 s. 17 is one such provision, which provides that only entities which were previously authorized by central government could claim deemed authorization \u2013 Appellant lacked such authorization, therefore cannot be treated as entity with deemed authorization \u2013 Adani gas case was overruled as it did not interpret the law correctly \u2013 (ii) All criteria provided under regulation 18 have to be considered, having regard to their inter-linkages \u2013 Therefore, the question of picking and choosing one criterion, and ignoring others does not arise and moreover it dependent on the individual facts of the case \u2013 This per se does not render the power arbitrary \u2013 Remedy of judicial review is always available in case of arbitrariness \u2013 Further observed, objective for framing Regulation 18, is compatible to the overall objectives of the PNGRB Act \u2013 Regulation 18 is not contraindicated by any specific provision of the Act \u2013 The various factors mentioned in it, provide an objective basis for the Board to consider the proper method of granting authorization \u2013 Further, as the sectoral regulator, PNGRB is entrusted with the power to frame appropriate regulations to ensure the objectives of the Act, therefore, it is not ultra-vires to Act \u2013 (iii) Appellant\u2019s claim is precluded by the principle of approbate- reprobate, as it accepted authorization granted by PNGRB (including exclusion of disputed areas), furnished the performance bond and even participated in the auction for the excluded areas, and only thereafter challenged authorization when its bid was unsuccessful."
