Ramasubramanian,J. (Concurring)] \u2013 s.114 has nothing to do with, nor is in connectionwith conclusive proof of legitimacy dealt with by s.112 \u2013 Both s.112and s.114 fall under different compartments \u2013 s.114(h) has noapplication to a case where a mother refuses to make the childundergo DNA test \u2013 Furthermore, on facts, respondent had accessto the wife both at the time when the child was begotten and for afull period of three years even thereafter \u2013 Therefore, the conclusiveproof u/s.112 has actually come into play in this case \u2013 Contentionof the respondent that what is sought to be invoked is only s.114(h)and not s.112 is rejected. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.112 \u2013 Question of legitimacy of thechild, burden of proof \u2013 Held: Since s.112 creates a presumption oflegitimacy that a child born during the subsistence of a marriage isdeemed to be legitimate, a burden is cast on the person who questionsthe legitimacy of the child.Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.112 \u2013 Principle underlying \u2013 \u201caccess\u201d,\u201cnon-access\u201d \u2013 Meaning \u2013 Held: Principle underlying s.112 is toprevent an unwarranted enquiry as to the paternity of the childwhose parents, at the relevant time had \u201caccess\u201d to each other \u2013\u201caccess\u201d or \u201cnon-access\u201d does not mean actual co-habitation butmeans the \u201cexistence\u201d or \u201cnon-existence\u201d of opportunities for sexualrelationship \u2013 s.112 refers to point of time of birth as the crucialaspect and not to the time of conception \u2013 The time of conception isrelevant only to see whether the husband had or did not have accessto the wife \u2013 Operation of the conclusive presumption can be avoidedby proving non-access at the relevant time.International Law \u2013 International Conventions/Treaties\u2013 TheConvention on Rights of Child \u2013 Best interests of a child \u2013 Rights toPrivacy, Autonomy and Identity of Children \u2013 Discussed.Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.112 \u2013 Object of \u2013 Held: A child shouldnot be lost in its search for paternity \u2013 Precious childhood andyouth cannot be lost in a quest to know about one\u2019s paternity \u2013Therefore, the wholesome object of Section 112 of the Evidence Actwhich confers legitimacy on children born during the subsistenceof a valid marriage, subject to the same being rebutted by cogentand strong evidence, is to be preserved \u2013 A finding as to illegitimacy,if revealed in a DNA test, effect on the child psychologically,discussed.Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.4, 112 \u2013 Held: A combined readingof ss.4 and 112 would show that once the party questioning thelegitimacy of the birth of a child shows that the parties to the marriagehad no access to each other, then the benefit of s.112 is not availableto the party invoking s.112 \u2013 However, if such a party is not able toprove that he had no access to the other party to the marriage, thenthe shield of s.112 protects the other party to such an extent that itcannot be pierced by any amount of evidence in view of theprohibition contained in s.4.  Words & Phrases:\u201cmay presume\u201d, \u201cshall presume\u201d and \u201cconclusive proof\u201d \u2013Discussed \u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.4, 112 and 114.\u201cinference\u201d, \u201cadverse inference\u201d \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Discussed.Maxims \u2013 Pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant \u2013 Held: Questionsas to illegitimacy of a child, are only incidental to the claim ofdissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery or infidelity \u2013Allowing DNA tests to be conducted on a routine basis, in order toprove adultery, would amount to redefinition of the aforesaid maxim,which means, the father is he whom the nuptials point out.Allowing the appeal"
