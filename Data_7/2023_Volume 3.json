P4) by applying 10% cut \u2013 Notably, sofar as the first notification dated 30.06.2005 is concerned, the HighCourt applied the cut of 50% \u2013 Even otherwise, the sale deedproduced as Ex. P4 is dated 2.11.2006 and the acquisition of thesame villages commenced vide notification dated 30.06.2005 andtherefore the sale deed after the first notification dated 30.06.2005could not have been the basis for assessing/determining thecompensation with respect to the subsequent acquisition \u2013 On thecontrary, giving 8 to 12 percent cumulative increase on the amountof compensation awarded for the land acquired vide notificationdated 30.06.2005, would be a safe and guiding factor \u2013 If that beso, compensation with respect to the land acquired vide notificationdated 5.3.2007, would come to Rs. 30,73,280/- per acre (Rs.24,50,000/- + 12% increase = Rs.27,44,000/- + 12% increase =Rs.30,73,280/-) \u2013 Impugned common judgment of the High Courtaccordingly modified."
