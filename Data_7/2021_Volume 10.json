National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Interpretation of \u2013 Purposive interpretation \u2013 The provision must be read with the intention to accentuate them, especially as they concern protections of rights under Art.21 and also deal with vital environmental policy and its regulatory aspects. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Salient features \u2013 Discussed. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Role of National Green Tribunal \u2013 The Schedule I of the NGT Act is concerned with implementation of few environmental related enactments such as the Water Act, the Air Act, the Environment Act, the Forest Conservation Act etc \u2013 As one looks at these enactments, an expanded role for the NGT is clearly discernible \u2013 The activities of the NGT are not only geared towards the protection of the environment but also to ensure that the developments do not cause serious and irreparable damage to the ecology and the environment \u2013 NGT is primarily concerned with protection of the environment and also preservation of the natural resources \u2013 As the specialized forum, the NGT would be expected to take preventive action, besides settling and adjudicating disputes and pass orders on all environment related questions \u2013 NGT is not just an adjudicatory body but has to perform wider functions in the nature of prevention, remedy and amelioration. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010: Power of National Green Tribunal \u2013 In case of environmental events causing damage \u2013 The NGT is empowered to carry out restitutive exercise for compensating persons adversely affected by environmental events \u2013 The larger discourse which informs such functions is related to distributive and corrective justice \u2013 Even in the absence of harm inflicted by human agency, in a situation of a natural calamity, the NGT will be required to devise a plan for alleviating damage \u2013 An inquisitorial function is also available for the NGT, within and without adversarial significance \u2013 Many of these functions do not require an active \u201cdispute\u201d, but the formulation of decisions. National Green Tribunal: Suo motu power, exercise of \u2013 The specialized tribunal\u2019s exercise of suo motu powers is somewhat distinct from those exercised by the constitutional Courts \u2013 The Supreme Court and High Courts can foray into any issues under their constitutional mandate but the NGT cannot naturally travel beyond its environmental domain in reference to the scheduled enactments \u2013 However, as long as the sphere of action is not breached, the NGT\u2019s powers must be understood to be of the widest amplitude. National Green Tribunal: Uniqueness of NGT vis-a-vis other Tribunals \u2013 The statutory Tribunals are categorized to fall under four subheads; Administrative Tribunals under Art.323A; Tribunals under Art.323B; Specialized sector Tribunals and most prominently; Tribunals to safeguard rights under Art.21 \u2013 The duties of NGT brings it within the ambit of the fourth category, creating a compelling proposition for wielding much broader powers as delineated by the statute. National Green Tribunal: Sui Generis role of NGT \u2013 NGT is a specialised forum \u2013 The NGT is a Tribunal with sui generis characteristic, with the special and all-encompassing jurisdiction to protect the environment \u2013 Besides its adjudicatory role as an appellate authority, it is also conferred with the responsibility to discharge role of supervisory body and to decide substantial questions relating to the environment \u2013 The necessity of having a specialized body, with the expertise to handle multi-dimensional environmental issues allows for an all-encompassing framework for environmental justice \u2013 The technical expertise that may be required to address evolving environmental concerns would definitely require a flexible institutional mechanism for its effective exercise. National Green Tribunal: An Authority to take suo motu cognizance of matter \u2013 NGT is not required to be triggered into action by an aggrieved or interested party alone \u2013 The exercise of power by the NGT is not circumscribed by receipt of application \u2013 When substantial questions relating to the environment arise and the issue is civil in nature and those relate to the enactments in Schedule I of the Act, the NGT even in the absence of an application, can self-ignite action either towards amelioration or towards prevention of harm. Environmental law: Precautionary Principle \u2013 Application of \u2013 Held: The principle must apply in the widest amplitude to ensure that it is not only resorted to for adjudicatory purposes but also for other \u2018decisions\u2019 or \u2018orders\u2019 to governmental authorities or polluters, when they fail to \u201cto anticipate, prevent and attack the causes of environmental degradation \u2013 Two aspects must therefore be emphasized i.e. that the NGT is itself required to carry out preventive and protective measures, as well as hold governmental and private authorities accountable for failing to uphold environmental interests \u2013 Thus, a narrow interpretation for NGT\u2019s powers should be eschewed to adopt one which allows for full flow of the forum\u2019s power within the environmental domain \u2013 Doctrines/Principles. Environmental law: Environmental justice and equity \u2013 When substantive justice is elusive for a large segment, disengaging with substantive rights at the very altar, for a perceived procedural lacuna, would surely bring in a process, which furthers inequality, both economic and social \u2013 An \u201cequal footing\u201d conception may not, therefore, be feasible to adequately address the asymmetrical relationship between the polluters and those affected by their actions \u2013 Instead, a recognition of the historical experience of marginalized classes of persons while accessing and effectively using the legal system, will allow for necessary appreciation of social realities and balancing the arm of justice."

Penal Code, 1860: s.375 \u2013 Distinction between \u2018preparation\u2019 and \u2018attempt\u2019 to commit an offence \u2013 There is a visible distinction between \u2018preparation\u2019 and \u2018attempt\u2019 to commit an offence and it all depends on the statutory edict coupled with the nature of evidence produced in a case \u2013 The stage of \u2018preparation\u2019 consists of deliberation, devising or arranging the means or measures, which would be necessary for commission of offence \u2013 Whereas, an \u2018attempt\u2019 to commit the offence, starts immediately after the completion of preparation \u2013 \u2018Attempt\u2019 is the execution of mens rea after preparation \u2013 \u2018Attempt\u2019 starts where \u2018preparation\u2019 comes to an end, though it falls short of actual commission of the crime."

XXI, r.94 would show that it passes through three important stages (other than certain intervening stages), conduct of sale; sale becoming absolute; and issue of sale certificate \u2013 After all these three stages are crossed, the fourth stage of delivery of possession comes under r.95 of Or.XXI \u2013 It is at this fourth stage that the appellants have raised the objection relating to Or.XXI, r.64 \u2013 It is not as if the judgment debtor was not aware of the fact that the property in entirety was included in the proclamation of sale \u2013 Therefore, the claim on the basis of Or.XXI, r. 64 was rightly rejected by the High Court.  Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.11 \u2013 Applicability of, to execution proceedings \u2013 Original judgment debtor filed a petition under s.47, way back on 02.09.1975 \u2013 Second petition under s.47 thus will be barred by res judicata \u2013 Before Act 104 of 1976 came into force, there was one view that the provisions of s.11 of the Code had no application to execution proceedings \u2013 But under Act 104 of 1976 Explanation VII was inserted under s.11 and it says that the provisions of this Section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of a decree and reference in this Section to any suit, issue or former suit shall be construed as references to a proceeding for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding and a former proceeding for the execution of that decree \u2013 Res judicata."

Specific Relief Act, 1963: s.16(c) \u2013 Suit for specific performance of the agreement to sell \u2013 Both, the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court held all the issues in favour of the plaintiff including the issue that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of contract \u2013 However, High Court in exercise of powers under s.100 of the CPC reversed the concurrent findings recorded by both the Courts below on readiness and willingness, solely on the ground that there were no specific averments in the plaint required as per s.16(c) of the Act \u2013 High Court also allowed the appeal on the ground that the relief of specific performance is the discretionary relief under s.20 of the Act and that even though the execution of the agreement to sell is proved and even the plaintiff was found to be always ready and willing to perform his part of the obligation under the agreement to sell, the decree of specific performance is not automatic and such grant of decree is dependent upon the principles of justice, equity and good conscience \u2013 On appeal, held: High Court committed a grave error in holding the issue with respect to readiness and willingness against the plaintiff solely on the ground that there were no specific averments/pleadings in the plaint as required under s.16(c) of the Act \u2013 The fact that initially payment of Rs.25,000/- was made at the time of execution of the agreement to sell and further sum of Rs.15,000/- in two installments were paid at the time when the subsequent two documents were executed for extension of time and even the time was extended at the instance of defendant No.1 and the balance amount of Rs.16,000/- was to be paid at the time of execution of the sale deed proved that the plaintiff was always ready and willing to perform his part of the contract under the agreement to sell \u2013 Suit for specific performance of agreement of sell decreed. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908: s.100 \u2013 Scope of interference \u2013 Held: There were concurrent findings of fact recorded by Trial Court as well as First Appellate Court on readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff, which were on appreciation of evidence on record \u2013 Therefore, in exercise of powers under s.100 of the CPC, High Court ought not to have interfered with such findings of fact unless such findings are found to be perverse \u2013 The findings recorded by the Trial Court as well as the First Appellate Court on readiness and willingness on the part of the plaintiff showed that they were not perverse and/or contrary to the evidence on record \u2013 On the contrary, High Court had ignored the necessary aspects on readiness and willingness including the conduct on the part of the parties \u2013 Specific Relief Act, 1963 \u2013 s.16(c)."

Karnataka Control of Organised Crimes Act, 2000: ss.3(1), 3(2), 3(3), 3(4) \u2013 For offence under ss.3(2), 3(3), 3(4), it is not essential that more than two chargesheets are filed against the person so named, before a competent court within the preceding period of ten years and that court has taken cognizance of such offence \u2013 That requirement applies essentially to an offence punishable only under s.3(1) of the 2000 Act \u2013 As regards offences punishable under ss.3(2), 3(3), 3(4) or 3(5), it can proceed against any person sans such previous offence registered against him, if there is material to indicate that he happens to be a member of the organized crime syndicate who had committed the offences in question and it can be established that there is material about his nexus with the accused who is a member of the organized crime syndicate."

The grant of furlough is regulated by r.3 and r.4 \u2013 While r.3 provides the eligibility criteria for grant of furlough for prisoners serving different lengths of imprisonment, r.4 imposes limitations \u2013 The use of the expression \u201cmay be released\u201d in r.3 indicates the absence of an absolute right \u2013 This is further emphasised in r.17 which states that said Rules do not confer a legal right on a prisoner to claim release on furlough \u2013 Thus, the grant of release on furlough is a discretionary remedy circumscribed by rr.3 and 4. A Furlough and parole \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Held: Furlough and parole envisage a short-term temporary release from custody \u2013 While parole is granted for the prisoner to meet a specific exigency, furlough may be granted after a stipulated number of years have been served without any reason \u2013 The grant of furlough is to break the monotony of imprisonment and to enable the convict to maintain continuity with family life and integration with society \u2013 Although furlough can be claimed without a reason, the prisoner does not have an absolute legal right to claim furlough \u2013 The grant of furlough must be balanced against the public interest and can be refused to certain categories of prisoners."

National Investigation Agency Act, 2008: s.6(7) \u2013 Continuation of investigation by the ATS Nanded, propriety of \u2013 Investigation was initiated by the ATS Nanded following the registration of the FIR on 14 July 2016, on receipt of source information that appellant-N was in contact over the internet with members of IS/ISIS/ISIL/Daesh \u2013 This led to arrest of four accused persons, including appellant-N and one \u2018M\u2019 \u2013 Thereafter, considering the gravity of the offence involved, the Central government directed the NIA Mumbai to take up further investigation of the case on 8 September 2016, exercising its powers under s.6(4) of the NIA Act \u2013 NIA Mumbai re-numbered the case on 14 September 2016 \u2013 However, the NIA Mumbai intimated the ATS Nanded to transfer the case records to them on 23 November 2016, and it was only on 8 December 2016 that the records were handed over to the NIA Mumbai by the ATS Nanded \u2013 Meanwhile, ATS Nanded had filed the charge-sheet before the CJM, Nanded on 7 October 2016 (which was prior to even the letter of the NIA Mumbai dated 23 November 2016 for the handing over of the case records) \u2013 Likewise, the CJM, Nanded took cognizance of the offence and committed the case to trial before the ASJ, Nanded on 18 October 2016 \u2013 While the NIA Mumbai may have re-numbered the case file on 14 September 2016, it could not have taken the initial step of its investigation into the case till it had access to the case papers, which it only received from the ATS Nanded on 8 December 2016 \u2013 Thus, the mere renumbering of the case filed by the NIA Mumbai did not take away the power of the ATS Nanded to continue the investigation \u2013 The said authority could do so till the records of the case were received by the NIA Mumbai \u2013 Hence, the investigation conducted by the ATS Nanded prior to this was within the mandate of sub-Section (7) of s.6 of the NIA Act \u2013 The said provision is clarificatory in nature so as to remove any doubt about the duty of the officer in-charge of the police station to continue the investigation till the \u2018Agency\u2019, i.e., the NIA Mumbai in the instant case, took up the investigation on receipt of the case papers \u2013 Therefore, the continuation of the investigation, and the filing of the charge-sheet upon its conclusion, by the ATS Nanded was in terms of the statutory mandate under s.6(7) of the NIA Act. National Investigation Agency Act, 2008: ss.10, 11 \u2013 Jurisdiction of CJM Nanded for remand and committal to trial \u2013 A reading of s.10 of the NIA Act indicates that there is no embargo on the State Investigating Agency to investigate a scheduled offence, which would include offences under the UAPA \u2013 Consequently, till the investigation was taken up by the NIA Mumbai, the ATS Nanded was acting within jurisdiction in investigating the offence and filing the charge-sheet in the instant case \u2013 NIA Mumbai took up the investigation only on 8 December 2016 after receiving the records from the ATS Nanded, and thereupon it filed an application for transfer of the case from the ASJ, Nanded to the NIA Special Court, Mumbai constituted under s.11 of the NIA Act \u2013 However, till the NIA Mumbai took over the investigation, jurisdiction would reside with a Court which ordinarily had it \u2013 The Government of Maharashtra in exercise of powers conferred by s.11 read with s.185 of the CrPC had issued a notification dated 26 August 2016 designating the CJM, Nanded as the remand court and the ASJ, Nanded as a Special Court for the trial of cases filed by the ATS Nanded \u2013 There was no challenge to the said notification \u2013 In this backdrop, the CJM, Nanded was designated as a Court of remand and the ASJ, Nanded as a Special Court under the CrPC for the trial of cases filed by the ATS Nanded \u2013 Hence, they both had the jurisdiction to entertain the instant case under the UAPA till the NIA Mumbai took over the investigation on 8 December 2016, and sought a transfer of the case to the NIA Special Court at Mumbai constituted under s.11 of the NIA Act \u2013 Jurisdiction."

        "HeadNote": "Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.482 \u2013 Allegation against appellant was that the son of the complainant committed suicide due to mental harassment meted out by the appellant \u2013 Appellant was physical Training Teacher in the school where complainant\u2019s son was student \u2013 Appellant was also assigned responsibility for maintaining overall discipline by the students of the school \u2013 The allegations in the FIR was that the appellant had harassed and insulted her son in the presence of everyone due to which he was under deep mental pressure and committed suicide \u2013 High Court dismissed s. 482 application for quashing the FIR \u2013 Hence the instant appeal \u2013 Held: To constitute an alleged abetment of suicide under s.306 IPC, there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of offence of suicide \u2013 In the FIR and as also the statement of the complainant recorded by the police, no reasons or cause for the appellant to harass and insult the victim were spelled out nor there were any details with respect to any action on the part of the appellant by which the deceased boy might have felt being harassed and insulted \u2013 Appellant in his petition under s.482 before the High Court set out detailed facts and circumstances, which unfortunately the High Court failed to even take notice of much less analyse the same before coming to the conclusion \u2013 It was also stated therein that the victim, school student, generally used to bunk his classes and was warned by the appellant and other school staff a number of times \u2013 Persistent act of bunking classes was reported to the Principal of the School, who informed the parents of the boy to come to the school \u2013 A simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour or indiscipline by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate good qualities of a human being in a student would definitely not amount to instigation or intentionally aid to the commission of suicide by a student \u2013 No further overt act was attributed to the appellant either in the FIR or in the statement of the complainant, nor anything in this regard was stated in the alleged suicide note \u2013 Thus, no mens rea can be attributed \u2013 In the absence of the element of abetment missing from the allegations, the essential ingredients of offence under s.306 IPC do not exist \u2013 All these facts were clearly ignored by the High Court while mechanically dismissing the petition under s.482 CrPC on the ground that FIR disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence \u2013 High Court was not justified in dismissing the application under s.482 CrPC for quashing the FIR in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.306. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.482 \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: High Court has inherent power to act ex debito justitiae i.e., to do real and substantial justice, or to prevent abuse of the process of the Court \u2013 The powers being very wide in itself imposes a solemn duty on the Courts, requiring great caution in its exercise \u2013 The Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of this power is based on sound principles \u2013 The inherent power vested in the Court should not be exercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution \u2013 However, the inherent power or the extra-ordinary power conferred upon the High Court, entitles the said Court to quash a proceeding, if it comes to the conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the Court, or the ends of justice require that the proceeding ought to be quashed. Penal Code, 1860: s.306 \u2013 Abetment of suicide \u2013 Essential ingredients \u2013 There must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide."

Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 \u2013 Standard of proof \u2013 Held: Proof beyond reasonable doubt is required since the proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature. Contempt of Court \u2013 Disputed questions of facts \u2013 Held: While dealing with a contempt petition, the Court is not expected to conduct a roving inquiry and go beyond the very judgment which was allegedly violated \u2013 Said principle has to be applied with more vigor when disputed questions of facts are involved."

Penal Code, 1860: ss.391, 395, 397 \u2013 Prosecution case was that on the fateful night, A-1 to A-5, with an intention to commit robbery, proceeded in a car with knife and iron pipes and reached a place where PW-1 was coming on bicycle \u2013 A-1 remained in the car \u2013 A-2 to A-5 pushed PW-1, A-3 attacked him with iron rod on his head and one of them plucked the bag containing Rs.60,000 and 16 gram jewellery hanging on the cycle handle \u2013 When PW-2 prevented A-2 to A-5 from escaping, A-2 assaulted him on the head with the rod \u2013 All accused ran away from the place along with the bag \u2013 Charges framed against the accused except \u2018B\u2019 (absconded accused) who was tried separately \u2013 Trial court convicted accused under s.397 \u2013 Conviction was affirmed by appellate court and also High Court \u2013 Instant appeal filed by A-1 and A-3 \u2013 Held: The allegation of use of weapon was against A-2 and accused \u2018B\u2019 \u2013 Appellants (A-1 and A-3) were not alleged to have used any weapon \u2013 Therefore, in the absence of any allegations of use of any deadly weapon by the appellants, s.397 shall not be attracted and to that extent they ought not to have been convicted for the offence punishable under s.397 \u2013 As regards the offence under s.391, submission of the appellants was that even no case was made out for offence under s.391 and they cannot be punished under s.395 as what is required to be proved is involvement of five or more persons conjointly in committing the robbery and in this case only four persons were tried and the prosecution has failed to prove the involvement of five or more persons \u2013 However, as such in the FIR, there was a reference to five persons involved in committing the robbery \u2013 Even the charge-sheet was filed against five persons \u2013 However, as two accused absconded, the trial was split and three accused came to be tried \u2013 Accused \u2018B\u2019 was tried subsequently and one person is still absconding \u2013 Further, there were concurrent findings recorded by all the courts below that five persons were involved in committing the offence of robbery \u2013 Merely because some of the accused absconded and less than five persons came to be tried in the trial, it cannot be said that the offence under s.391 punishable under s.395 was not made out \u2013 What is required to be considered is the involvement and commission of the offence of robbery by five persons or more and not whether five or more persons were tried \u2013 Once it is found on evidence that five or more persons conjointly committed the offence of robbery or attempted to commit the robbery, a case would fall under s.391 and would fall within the definition of \u2018dacoity\u2019 \u2013 Therefore, in the facts and circumstances, appellants are liable to be convicted for the offence under s.391 punishable under s.395 IPC. A Penal Code, 1860: s.395 and s.397 \u2013 Essential ingredients \u2013 \u2018Dacoity\u2019 is nothing but an exaggerated version of \u2018robbery\u2019 with a difference in number of accused \u2013 Therefore, even in a case where the accused is not convicted for the offence under s.397, still he can be punished under s.395 and no prejudice shall be caused to him as ultimately the prosecution has to prove the \u2018robbery\u2019 and \u2018dacoity\u2019 either for the offence punishable under s.395 or under s.397 \u2013 However, to bring the case against the accused under s.397, the prosecution has to prove one additional fact that the offender has used any deadly weapon or has caused grievous hurt to any person, or has attempted to cause death or grievous hurt to any person. Criminal jurisprudence: Acquittal of accused \u2018B\u2019 who was tried separately as he absconded after incident \u2013 Benefit of acquittal of \u2018B\u2019 claimed by other accused \u2013 Held: The accused are to be tried and convicted on the basis of evidence made in the trial in which they are convicted \u2013 \u2018B\u2019 came to be tried after a period of 15 years as his trial was split as he absconded \u2013 From the acquittal order passed in the case of \u2018B\u2019, it appears that PW1 during the trial of \u2018B\u2019 turned hostile \u2013 In the case of \u2018B\u2019, only five witnesses came to be examined and for whatever reasons other witnesses were not examined \u2013 In this case, PW1 not only supported the case of prosecution but as many as 15 witnesses came to be examined \u2013 Therefore, merely because in the subsequent split trial, \u2018B\u2019 came to be acquitted, the benefit of such acquittal cannot be in favour of the appellants-accused as the prosecution was successful in proving the case against the accused."

Ex. P-12 was the covering letter enclosing a demand draft dated 26-09-2003 \u2013 That document categorically referred to the sale transaction, clearly spelling out that the amount was towards an instalment payable as consideration for purchase of property \u2013 The District Judge and the High Court could not have upset the order of the tribunal as regards the appellant\u2019s exercise of right to purchase the property, u/s. 15 \u2013 Therefore, the impugned order of the High Court, as well as the judgment of the District Court, are set aside."

Mental Health: The High Court while deciding merits of s.482 Cr.P.C petition has made observations diminishing the importance of mental health \u2013 Mental health of an individual cannot be compressed to a one size fit all approach."

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or. II, R.2 \u2013 A building in a dilapidated condition demolished by the corporation \u2013 Plaintiff- tenant filed first suit, seeking mandatory injunction and possession after demolition of building, followed by second suit claiming damages \u2013 The High Court held that suit is not barred by the principles of Or.II, R.2 of CPC and cause of action in both the suits was different \u2013 Held: Every suit shall include whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action \u2013 The cause of action is a bundle of facts and relief of damages is construed to be a component of such bundle of facts \u2013 The plaintiff filed first suit after demolition of the building, the right to claim damages for loss of the property including goods and machines was available to the plaintiff on the said date \u2013 The plaintiff was required to obtain leave of the Court before filing suit for damages subsequently \u2013 The High Court has clearly erred in law in holding that the cause of action for both the suits is different."

        "HeadNote": "Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 ss. 16, 39, 49, 59 and 168 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 \u2013 Circular dated 29.12.2017 issued by the Commissioner (GST) \u2013 Validity of \u2013 Act of 2017 and Rules of 2017 brought into force along with Forms GSTR-1, GSTR-2, GSTR-2A, GSTR-3 and GSTR-3B \u2013 Various notifications were issued \u2013 In exercise of the powers conferred by Rule 61(5) of the stated Rules, the Central Government issued Notification No.21/2017-Central Tax specifying that the return for the months of July and August 2017 to be furnished in Form GSTR-3B electronically through the common portal before the dates as specified in the corresponding entry in column (3) of the table given therein \u2013 Thereafter again various notifications/circulars were regarding extension of time (notification dated 17.08.2017), relating to system-based reconciliation of information furnished in Forms GSTR-1, GSTR-2 and GSTR-3B and the mechanism for correction of erroneous details furnished in Form GSTR-3B, specifying the timeline for filing of return in Form GSTR-3B (circular dated 01.09.2017) etc. were issued \u2013 The Commissioner (GST) then issued the circular dated 29.12.2017, on the subject of filing of returns under GST, clarifying certain issues considered by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs to usher in uniformity in implementation across field formations \u2013 By this Circular, the earlier Circular issued on 01.09.2017 was kept in abeyance \u2013 Paragraph 4 of the Circular dated 29.12.2017 specifies \u201c...It may be noted that while making adjustment in the output tax liability or input tax credit, there can be no negative entries in the FORM GSTR-3B \u2013 The amount remaining for adjustment, if any, may be adjusted in the return(s) in FORM GSTR-3B of subsequent month(s) and, in cases where such adjustment is not feasible, refund may be claimed...\u201d \u2013 Respondent No. 1 was, however, keen on availing of the dispensation specified in the Circular dated 01.09.2017 for the relevant period (July to September 2017) \u2013 After Form GSTR-2A became operational in September 2018, respondent No. 1 realized that it had sufficient amount in the ITC ledger account (electronic credit ledger) during the relevant period \u2013 Further, due to non- functionality of GSTR-2A, respondent No. 1 had to discharge its OTL by depositing/paying in cash \u2013 Respondent No.1 urged to rectify Form GSTR-3B \u2013 However, the impugned Circular dated 29.12.2017 came in the way of respondent No. 1 in doing so \u2013 Resultantly, respondent No.1 approached the High Court by way of writ petition \u2013 High Court allowed the writ petition and read down paragraph 4 of circular dated 29.12.2017 to the extent it restricted the rectification of Form GSTR-3B in respect of period in which the error had occurred \u2013 Before the Supreme Court respondent no. 1 contended that the circular dated 29.12.2017 was issued without any authority of law \u2013 Held: The decision was taken by the Board after considering various representations received seeking clarifications on various aspects of return filing such as return filing dates, applicability of quantum of late fee, amendment of errors in submitting/filing of Form GSTR-3B and other related queries \u2013 In strict sense, it is not the direction issued by the Commissioner (GST) as such, but it is notifying the decision(s) of the Board taken in exercise of its powers conferred u/s. 168(1) of the 2017 Act \u2013 The circular was issued under the signatures of Commissioner (GST), but in essence, it was notifying the decision(s) of the Board, which has authority and power to issue directions \u2013 The stipulations in the stated circular including paragraph 4 are consistent with the provisions of the 2017 Act and the Rules \u2013 The express provision in the form of s. 39(9) clearly posits that omission or incorrect particulars furnished in the return in Form GSTR-3B can be corrected in the return to be furnished in the month or quarter during which such omission or incorrect particulars are noticed \u2013 Accordingly, the argument that the impugned Circular dated 29.12.2017 was issued without authority of law is rejected. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 ss. 16, 39, 49 and 59 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017 \u2013 rr. 59, 60 and 61 \u2013 Rectification of Form GSTR-3B \u2013 The grievance of the writ petitioner-respondent no.1 before the High Court was that due to non-operability of Form GSTR-2A at the relevant time (July to September 2017), it was denied of access to the information about its electronic credit ledger account and consequently, availing of Input Tax Credit (ITC) for the relevant period and instead to discharge the Output Tax Liability (OTL) by paying cash to its vendors \u2013 Thus, it has resulted in payment of double tax and unfair advantage to the tax authorities because of their failure to operationalize the statutory forms enabling auto-populating statement of inward supplies of the recipient and outward supplies including facility of matching and correcting the discrepancies electronically \u2013 The High Court allowed the writ petition for the period to which the \u2018error relates\u2019 i.e. July to September 2017 \u2013 High Court also allowed writ petitioner to rectify Form GSTR-3B for the period in which error had occurred \u2013 On appeal, held: The writ petitioner being a registered person, was under a legal obligation to maintain books of accounts and records as per the provisions of the 2017 Act and Chapter VII of the 2017 Rules regarding the transactions in respect of which the OTL would occur \u2013 Even in the past (till recently upto the 2017 Act came into force), during the pre-GST regime, the writ petitioner (being registered person/assessee) had been maintaining such books of accounts and records and submitting returns on its own \u2013 No such auto-populated electronic data was in vogue \u2013 It is the same pattern which had to be followed by the registered person in the post-GST regime \u2013 Further, as per scheme of the 2017 Act, registered person is obliged to do self-assessment of ITC, reckon its eligibility to ITC and of OTL including the balance amount lying in cash or credit ledger primarily on the basis of his office record and books of accounts required to be statutorily preserved \u2013 That he could do without the common electronic portal as was being done in the past till recently pre-GST regime \u2013 The factum of non-operability of Form GSTR-2A, therefore, is a flimsy plea taken by the writ petitioner \u2013 The writ petitioner with full knowledge and information had done self- assessment and assessed the OTL for the relevant period and chose to discharge the same by paying cash \u2013 Having so opted, now it was not open to the respondent to resile from option already exercised \u2013 As far as rectification of errors is concerned, the matching and correction process happens on its own as per mechanism specified in ss.37 and 38, after which Form GSTR-3 is generated for the submission of returns; and once submitted any changes may have a cascading effect \u2013 Therefore, law permits rectification of error and omissions only at the initial stages of Form GSTR-1 and GSTR-3, but in a specified manner \u2013 The direction of the High Court to allow the rectification cannot be sustained \u2013 The impugned judgment and order of the High Court is set aside."

and (ii) such officer authorised may investigate the offences so specified in the order of authorisation \u2013 Therefore, as such, there is no requirement of giving either special reasons nor there is requirement to mention reasons \u2013 What is required to be considered is whether there is an application of mind with respect to offences and the relevant provisions with respect to authorisation \u2013 Considering the above authorisation, it cannot be said that such authorisation authorising inspector to investigate the FIR can be said to be vitiated and/or can be said to be void which warrants quashing of the entire criminal proceedings including the FIR \u2013 Ranbir Penal Code \u2013 s.120-B.J&K Prevention of Corruption Act, 2006: s.155 \u2013 Non- compliance of \u2013 By impugned order, High Court observed that for an investigating agency to investigate the group of offences which include the non-cognizable one, it must obtain a sanction from the concerned Magistrate before launching the investigation and in the instant case no such sanction from the concerned Magistrate was obtained \u2013 Propriety \u2013 Held: The substantive offences against the respondent were under J&K PC Act, 2006 and as per s.3 of the Act, all offences under the Act are cognizable and non-bailable \u2013 As such, the said issue is squarely covered against the respondent in view of the decision of this Court in the case of Pravin Chandra Mody wherein it was held that where the information discloses a cognizable as well as a non-cognizable offence, the police officer is not debarred from investigating any non-cognizable offence which may arise out of the same facts and he can include that non- cognizable offence in the charge-sheet which he presents for a cognizable offence \u2013 The offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act is a substantive offence and the investigation in respect of the offence under the PC Act, when considered and coupled with the offence of conspiracy, there is no requirement of prior sanction of the Magistrate \u2013 Merely because the offence of the conspiracy may be involved, investigation into the offence under the PC Act which is cognizable is not required to await a sanction from the Magistrate, as that would lead to a considerable delay and affect the investigation and it will derail the investigation \u2013 Therefore, the High Court erred in quashing the criminal proceedings on the ground that the offence under s.120B is a non-cognizable, prior sanction as required under s.155 of J&K Cr.P.C. is not obtained.Vigilance Manual, 2008: Rule 3.16 \u2013 Validity of \u2013 A close reading of Rule 3.16 showed that the same can be said to be in the interest of the accused and/or a person against whom the allegations are made and to safeguard the accused against frivolous complaints \u2013 As per Clause 3.16 only after the Preliminary Enquiry is conducted and there is a prima facie case found, an FIR is required to be registered \u2013 Considering the nature of offences, a detailed enquiry is required and therefore it is observed in Clause 3.16 that a PE should be completed normally within a period of six months \u2013 As per the law laid down in the case of Lalita Kumari, a detailed investigation into the allegations on merits is not required by holding Preliminary Enquiry and that such enquiry is to be completed within a period of seven days, however, it is not held that if the Preliminary Enquiry is not completed within a period of seven days, the entire criminal proceedings would be void and the same are to be quashed \u2013 Rule 3.16 can be said to be in consonance with the observations and the law laid down by this Court in the case of Lalita Kumari. Vigilance Manual, 2008: Rule 3.16 \u2013 While considering the prima facie case for the purpose of registering the FIR, some enquiry/ investigation is bound to be there, however, the same shall be only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case for the purpose of registration of the FIR only \u2013 Whatever enquiry is conducted at the stage of Preliminary Enquiry, by no stretch of imagination, will be considered as investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure which can only be after registration of the FIR \u2013 Even otherwise, merely because while holding a Preliminary Enquiry a detailed enquiry is made into the allegations made against the respondent which can be said to be only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case for the purpose of registration of the FIR and merely because some more time is taken in conducting the Preliminary Enquiry before registering the FIR, the entire criminal proceedings cannot be quashed \u2013 There shall not be any prejudice caused to the accused at the stage of holding Preliminary Enquiry which shall only be for the purpose of satisfying whether any prima facie case is made out with respect to the allegations made in the complaint which requires further investigation after registering the FIR or not \u2013 Therefore, the High Court has materially erred in holding and declaring Clause 3.16 as ultra vires. Liability: Vicariously liability of respondent in the absence of main conspirators \u2013 Allegations against the respondent are in respect of his individual capacity \u2013 Therefore, there is no question of any vicarious liability.

        "HeadNote": "Disinvestment: Policy of disinvestment \u2013 Union Government\u2019s divestment of its residual shareholding of 29.54 % in HZL company \u2013 Public interest litigation u/Art. 32, seeking mandamus directing the Union Government to refrain from disinvestment without amending the Nationalisation Act, 1976 \u2013 Held: Decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation\u2019s case, does not apply to the present facts because HZL had ceased to be a government company, at the stage of the disinvestment \u2013 Thus, the Union Government\u2019s decision to disinvest 29.54 per cent of its residual shareholding in HZL is not interdicted by the principles laid down by this Court in Centre for Public Interest Litigation\u2019s case that when the acquisition takes place under an Act of Parliament, any disinvestment by the Union Government can be undertaken only with the approval of Parliament or through its intervention \u2013There is no challenge to the disinvestment which took place in 1991-92 or in 2002, the latter having resulted in HZL ceasing to retain its status as a government company within the meaning of s. 617 of the Companies Act 1956 \u2013 It would be inconsistent to read an implied limitation on the transfer by the Union Government of its residual shareholding in HZL representing 29.54 per cent of the equity capital \u2013 Thus, when a decision is taken by the government as shareholder of a company to sell its shares, it acts as any other shareholder in a company who makes the decision on the basis of the financial and economic exigencies \u2013 Furthermore, SOVL company does not seek to exercise the second call option, in terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, as such the Union Government took decision to sell its residuary shareholding in the open market \u2013 Union Government being amenable to Part III of the Constitution, would not impose a restraint on its capacity to decide, as a shareholder, to disinvest its shareholding, the process of disinvestment being transparent and which comports with law and results in the best price being a shareholding \u2013 Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 32.  Constitution of India: Art. 32 \u2013 Writ petition under \u2013 Disinvestment of the residual 29.54 per cent shareholding of the Union Government challenged on the ground that the residual disinvestment can occur only after the amendment of the Nationalisation Act 1976 \u2013 Said prayer substantially similar to the reliefs sought in Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh\u2019s case, wherein they challenged the disinvestment of 2002 and 2014, on the basis of the decision in Centre for Public Interest Litigation \u2013 Petition, if barred by the principles of res judicata, following the dismissal of the earlier writ petition on the same issue \u2013 Held: The summary dismissal of an earlier petition u/Art. 32 does not bar the instant writ petition on grounds of res judicata as there has been no substantive decision on the merits of the issues, thus, the instant writ petition not barred by res judicata \u2013 Metal Corporation (Nationalisation and Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1976. Code of Civil Procedure 1908: s. 11 \u2013 Principle of res judicata \u2013 Determination of its applicability - Held: While determining the applicability of the principle of res judicata u/s. 11, the grave issues of public interest are not to be ignored merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits \u2013 There is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in public interest \u2013 Court to be aware of the contemporary reality and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice \u2013 Jurisdiction u/Art. 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself. H Investigation: CBI Crime Manual \u2013 Process of conducting CBI\u2019s preliminary enquiries \u2013 Preliminary enquiry by CBI into the suspected irregularities in the course of disinvestment of 26% equity holding of the Union Government to SOVL company in 2002 \u2013 Submission of status report by CBI \u2013 Held: There is no bar on the constitutional power of this Court to direct the CBI to register a regular case, in spite of its decision to close a preliminary enquiry \u2013 On facts, a prima facie case for a cognizable offence, as mandated in para 9.1 of the CBI Manual, made out \u2013 Sufficient material for registration of a regular case in relation to the 26 per cent disinvestment of HZL by the Union Government in 2002 \u2013 Thus, registration of a regular case, followed by a full-fledged investigation must be conducted \u2013 Issuance of direction to CBI to register a regular case and periodically submit status reports of its investigation to this Court \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 32."

and that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact- \u201cskin to skin\u201d with sexual intent \u2013 Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of \u201csexual assault\u201d \u2013 Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of \u201csexual assault\u201d u/s. 7 \u2013 Prosecution was not required to prove a \u201cskin to skin\u201d contact for proving the charge of sexual assault u/s. 7 \u2013 Allegation of sexual intent stood proved by the prosecution \u2013 All these acts were the acts of \u201csexual assault\u201d as contemplated u/s. 7, punishable u/s. 8 \u2013Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court restored. ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 \u2013 Allegation against accused L that he went to the house of the victim aged 5 years when no one was there, and caught the hand of the victim, moved her frock upward with one hand and lowered her pant with the other hand, and thereafter, unzipped his pant and showed his penis to her and asked her to lay down on the cot \u2013 When the mother of the victim returned, she saw one person had caught the hand of the victim and also saw the victim raising her pant \u2013 Special Court convicted and sentenced the accused for offences punishable u/s. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC and ss. 8 and 10 r/w s. 9(m) and 12 \u2013 High Court upheld the conviction u/ss. 448 and 354-A(1)(i) IPC rw s.12 of the POCSO, however, set aside the conviction u/ss. 8 and 10 and modified the sentence to the extent already undergone \u2013 On appeal, held: When the alleged acts of entering the house of the prosecutrix with sexual intent to outrage her modesty, of holding her hands and opening the zip of his pant showing his penis, are held to be established by the prosecution, there was no reason for the High Court not to treat such acts as the acts of \u201csexual assault\u201d within the meaning of s. 7 \u2013 Accused-L committed an offence of \u201csexual assault\u201d within the meaning of s. 7 and the prosecutrix being below the age of 12 years, he had committed an offence of \u201caggravated sexual assault\u201d as contemplated u/s. 9(m), liable to be punished with the imprisonment for a term not less than five years u/s. 10 \u2013 Thus, the order passed by the High Court set aside and that of the trial court are restored. Enactment of the Act \u2013 Object and reasons \u2013 Stated. Interpretation of statutes: Duty of the Court \u2013 Held: Courts should ascertain the intention of the Legislature enacting it, and should accept an interpretation or construction which promotes the object of the legislation and prevents its possible abuse. Rule of construction contained in maxim \u201cUt Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat\u201d \u2013 Held: Construction of a rule should give effect to the rule rather than destroying it \u2013 Any narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision which would defeat the object of the provision, cannot be accepted \u2013 Where the intention of the Legislature cannot be given effect to, the courts would accept the bolder construction for the purpose of bringing about an effective result - Maxim \u201cUt Res Magis Valeat Quam Pereat\u201d. Penal statue \u2013 Construction of \u2013 Held: Penal Statute enacting an offence or imposing a penalty has to be strictly construed \u2013 Thus, POCSO must be strictly constructed \u2013 However, clauses of a statute should be construed with reference to the context vis-a-vis the other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute relating to the subject matter \u2013 Thus, considering the objects of the POCSO Act, its provisions, more particularly pertaining to the sexual assault, sexual harassment etc. have to be construed vis-a-vis the other provisions, so as to make the objects of the Act more meaningful and effective \u2013 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Rule of lenity \u2013 Invocation of \u2013 Held: Where the legislature has manifested its intention, courts may not manufacture ambiguity in order to defeat that intent \u2013 Court should not be over zealous in searching for ambiguities or obscurities in words which are plain \u2013  As regards s.7 of the POCSO Act, the court did not find any ambiguity or obscurity so as to invoke the Rule of Lenity \u2013 Invocation of \u201cRule of lenity\u201d was misconceived \u2013 Submission that the \u201cRule of Lenity\u201d requires a court to resolve statutory ambiguity in a criminal statute in favour of the accused, or to strictly construe the statute against the State, cannot be accepted since the statutory ambiguity should be invoked as a last resort of interpretation \u2013 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Principle of \u201cejusdem generis\u201d \u2013 Application of \u2013 Held: Principle of \u201cejusdem generis\u201d should be applied only as an aid to the construction of the statute \u2013 It should not be applied where it would defeat the very legislative intent \u2013 If the specific words used in the section exhaust a class, it has to be construed that the legislative intent was to use the general word beyond the class denoted by the specific words. Crime against women: Offence of sexual assault \u2013 \u201cSkin to skin contact\u201d if, required to constitute an offence of sexual assault \u2013 Interpretation of expression \u201ctouch\u201d and \u201csexual assault\u201d \u2013 Analogous provisions as prevalent in foreign countries \u2013 Discussed. Words and phrases: Touch and physical contact, in the context of s. 7 of the POCSO Act \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 \u2013 s. 7. Practice and procedure:Certified copies of the judgments/ orders \u2013 Proper procedure for preparing the certified copies \u2013 Need for."

Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Multiplier \u2013 Deceased at the time of accident was aged between 21-22 years \u2013 Therefore, the multiplier has to be adopted/applied considering the age of the deceased and not the age of the parents thus, multiplier 18 would apply. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988: Entitlement of claimants to Just Compensation \u2013 The claimants are entitled to just compensation \u2013 Merely because in the execution proceedings they might have accepted the amount as awarded by the High Court, may be as full and final settlement, it shall not take away the right of the claimants to claim just compensation and shall not preclude them from claiming the enhanced amount of compensation which they as such are held to be entitled to \u2013 As such, the Motor Vehicles Act is a benevolent Act and the claimants are entitled to just compensation. As such, the Union of India ought not to have taken such a plea/defence."

B s. 149 \u2013 Unlawful assembly \u2013 Common object of an assembly \u2013 Held: Common object is different from common intention as it does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of minds before the attack \u2013 It is enough if each has the same object in view and their number is five or more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object \u2013 Common object of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language of the members composing it, from the surrounding circumstances and the course of conduct adopted by the members. Witnesses: Hostile witness \u2013 Evidentiary value \u2013 Held: Part of the evidence of the hostile witness which is creditworthy, can be acted upon \u2013 Criminal trial.

Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 \u2013 Right to life \u2013 Right to life guaranteed to the people also includes in its fold the right to live in a society which is free from crime and fear, and the right of witnesses to testify in courts in free and fair manner without fear or pressure \u2013 If one is unable to testify in courts due to threats or other pressures, it is a clear violation of Art. 19(1)(a) and Art. 21 \u2013 One of the main reasons for witnesses to turn hostile is that they are not accorded appropriate protection by the State \u2013 State to ensure the safety of the witnesses irrespective of case, creed, religion, such that they could safely depose the truth in the court at least in sensitive cases involving those in power, political patronage. Honour killings: Preventive steps, remedial and punitive measures to combat honour crimes \u2013 Suggestion of, in Shakti Vahini\u2019s case \u2013 Stated. Casteism: Commission of atrocities in the name of castes \u2013 Ghastly murders of three youngsters, by physically assaulting them for nearly 12 hours for violating caste-ridden societal norms \u2013 Held: Episodes of honour killing demonstrate that the casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of independence \u2013 Bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices impedes the objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens \u2013 High time for the civil society to react and respond with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste. Administration of justice: Administration of criminal justice \u2013 Racial and religiously motivated crimes, if to be treated as aggravating factors for enhanced punishment \u2013 Foreign laws-United Kingdom, Canada, United States vis-a-vis Indian laws \u2013 Discussed."
