and unless the powerto sub-delegate is conferred expressly or impliedly under a statute,the power cannot be sub-delegated \u2013 Held: Submission is completelymisplaced \u2013 s.76-A of the Principal Act enables the State Governmentto delegate some of the statutory powers conferred upon it by thePrincipal Act to the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority \u2013 Suchempowerment has nothing to do with the legislative power exercisedby the State in terms of which s.47-A was inserted, or with the Rulespromulgated to effectuate s.47-A \u2013 For interpreting and consideringthe context of s.47-A or the Rules, the fact that certain other statutorypowers in favour of the State Government are delegable, hasabsolutely no relation \u2013 s.47-A was inserted by the State in itslegislative power and the Rules framed thereunder have to beconsidered on their own and without being influenced by s.76-A ofthe Act \u2013 Tamil Nadu Stamp (Prevention of Undervaluation ofInstruments) Rules, 1968.Tamil Nadu Stamp (Prevention of Undervaluation ofInstruments) Rules, 1968: r.7 \u2013 Whether r.7 of the Rules prescribing3 months\u2019 time for the Collector to pass an order determining themarket value of the properties and duty payable on the instrumentfrom the first notice, is directory or mandatory \u2013 Held: Under sub-section (1) of s.47-A of the Stamp Act, if there is reason to believethat the market value has not been truly set forth in the Instrumenttendered for registration, a reference can be made to the Collector,who (i) after giving the parties reasonable opportunity of beingheard; and (ii) after holding an enquiry in such manner as may beprescribed by Rules, has to determine the correct value of theconcerned property \u2013 The Section by itself does not lay down anyperiod within which the entire process is to be completed by theCollector \u2013 It simply states that the enquiry be held in \u201csuch manner\u201das may be prescribed by Rules \u2013 If the stipulation or fixation ofperiod of three months from the first notice in terms of r.6 or fromnotice in Form II is taken to be mandatory, it would lead to asituation of incongruity \u2013 The fact that Form II notice had beenissued, would mean that on a prima facie view of the record andmaterial, the value stated in the instrument was not the correct value;which in turn would mean that prima facie the Government Cofferswere being denied the rightful dues \u2013 If for any reason, theproceedings are not completed within three months and, therefore,must be held to be vitiated, the public interest would suffer, and thepersons who were prime facie responsible for suppressing real valuewould stand to gain \u2013 The amendment of r.7 incorporating the periodof three months was essentially to guide the public officials tocomplete the process as early as possible but was not intended tocreate a right in favour of those who had prima facie conductedthemselves prejudicing public interest \u2013 Pertinently, the concernedprovision has not spelt out any consequence for non-adherence tosaid period of three months \u2013 The fixation of timeline of three monthsin r.7 is, therefore, purely directory \u2013 Stamp Act, 1899 \u2013 s.47A.Stamp Act, 1899: s.47A \u2013 Whether the appellate authority haspower under s.47A of the Act to enhance the market value of theproperty while deciding the appeal filed by the registrants \u2013 Held:Sub-section (6) of s.47-A of the Act empowers the Chief ControllingRevenue Authority, in exercise of suo motu power, to call for andexamine the correctness of an order passed under sub-section (2)or sub-section (3) of s.47-A; and if the order is prejudicial to theinterest of Revenue, the Chief Controlling Authority may make suchenquiry or cause such enquiry to be made and either revise, modifyor set aside such order and pass any order that it deems appropriate\u2013 There are some limitations on the exercise of said power, since noproceedings can be initiated against an order passed under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3), if the time for preferring an appealagainst that order has not expired, or if more than five years haveexpired after passing of the order \u2013 The intent is clear that if therebe sufficient time to prefer a regular appeal challenging that order,the remedy of filing an appeal ought to be taken resort to \u2013 Further,if the period of five years has expired, no suo motu power can beexercised \u2013 Another limitation is prescribed by sub-section (8), interms of which no order in exercise of suo motu exercise of powercan be passed which may adversely impact a person, unless thatperson has had reasonable opportunity of being heard \u2013 Apart fromthese limitations, the statutory provisions do not impose any otherrestriction, and the power is conferred principally to ensure that noorder passed under sub-sections (2) or (3) of s.47-A is prejudicialto the interest of the revenue \u2013 In the present case, while proposingto enhance the market value higher than what was determined bythe Collector, the appellate authority had put the appellant-registrantto sufficient notice and had called for response with regard to theproposed enhancement \u2013 It was nobody\u2019s case that as on the datewhen the proceedings were initiated in exercise of the power undersub-section (6) of s.47-A, the period for preferring the appeal hadnot expired, or that more than five years had expired after the passingof the order under sub-section (2) or sub-section (3) \u2013 In thecircumstances, none of the limitations which the statute has imposedupon the exercise of power were present \u2013 It is not as if theassessment made by the appellate authority was either opposed toprinciples of natural justice, or was so palpably incorrect, that itcould never be sustained \u2013 The exercise of power was definitelydesigned to obviate an obvious illegality and prejudice to the interestof the revenue \u2013 The exercise was, thus, absolutely correct, andthere was no occasion to set aside the orders passed in pursuancethereof."

\u2013 National Plan andguidelines as contemplated by the statute for Disaster Managementis by its very nature prior to the occurrence of any disaster and asa measure of preparedness \u2013 It is not conceivable that a NationalPlan would be framed after the disaster has occurred \u2013 A NationalPlan encompasses and contemplate all kinds of disasters \u2013 TheBiological and Public health emergencies has already beencontemplated in the National Plan, 2019, which as notified in table1-1 under paragraph 1.13.1 specifically includes epidemics: Viral,Bacterial, Parasitic, Fungal and prior infections \u2013 NovelCoronavirus is an epidemic which has become pandemic \u2013 Plan-2019 is complemented by several plans, Standard OperatingProcedures (SOPs), manuals, Guidelines at all levels of theGovernment \u2013 Further, the National Disaster Management Authorityhad issued guidelines in the year 2008 itself which has been furtherdetailed in Plan-2019 \u2013 All aspects of the epidemics, all measuresto contain an epidemic, preparedness, response, mitigation havebeen elaborately dealt in Plan-2019 \u2013 The Disaster ManagementAct, 2005 contain ample powers and measures, which can be takenby the National Disaster Management Authority, National ExecutiveCommittee and Central Government to prepare further plans,guidelines and Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs), which inrespect to

takenby competent authorities under Disaster Management Act, 2005,there is no occasion or need to issue any direction to Union ofIndia to prepare a fresh National Plan for COVID-19.Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 s.12 \u2013 Guidelines forMinimum Standards of Relief \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 Pandemic \u2013 A publicinterest litigation filed in wake of COVID-19 pandemic, seekingdirection to the Union of India to lay down minimum standards ofrelief u/s. 12 of the Act, 2005 to be provided to persons affectedwith COVID-19 \u2013 The petitioner pleaded that Centre should comeup with detailed guidelines recommending the minimum standardsof relief to be provided in the relief camps in relation to shelter,food, drinking water, medical cover and sanitation, in absence ofwhich, shelter homes and relief camps are susceptible of becominghotbeds for the spread of COVID-19 infection \u2013 It was furtherpleaded that the Centre should come up with detailed guidelinesunder s.12(ii) and (iii) of Act, 2005 for widows and orphans andex-gratia assistance to be provided to the kith and kin of thoselosing life because of COVID-19 infections but also as a result ofharsh lockdown restrictions \u2013

minimum requirement in the relief campsin respect of shelter, food, drinking water, medical cover andsanitation and other reliefs as contemplated in the section \u2013 Therebeing already guidelines for minimum standards in place even beforeCOVID-19, the said guidelines for minimum standards holds goodeven for those who are affected by COVID-19 \u2013 Further, Governmentof India has treated COVID-19 as a notified disaster for the purposeof providing assistance under State Disaster Response Fund, normsof assistance for ex-gratia payment to families of deceased personsand other assistance \u2013 Therefore, Union of India is not obliged tolay down minimum standard of relief u/s.12 and guidelines issuedu/s.12 providing for minimum standards of relief holds good forpandemic COVID-19 also.Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 s. 46 \u2013 National DisasterResponse Fund \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 Pandemic \u2013 Public Interest Litigation\u2013 The submissions of the petitioner centre around National DisasterResponse Fund (NDRF) and PM CARES Fund \u2013 It was submittedthat the earlier guidelines for administration of NDRF which cameinto force with effect from financial year 2010-11 have beenmodified by new guidelines with effect from financial year2015-16, and now it is not possible for any person or institution tomake contribution to the NDRF and it was further submitted thatdeletion of paragraph 5.5 of earlier guidelines makes it clear thatit is not possible for any person or institution to make anycontribution to NDRF \u2013 It was contended that paragraph 5.5 of theearlier guidelines was deleted to benefit the PM CARES Fund \u2013Held: New guidelines contain the same heading, i.e. \u2018Contributionto the NDRF\u2019 and guideline 5.2 provides \u2018Funds will be creditedinto the NDRF in accordance with the provisions of the s. 46(1)(a)& (b) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 The above guideline5.2 specifically referred to s. 46(1)(a) & (b) and s. 46(1)(b) expresslyprovides that any grants that may be made by any person or institutionfor the purpose of disaster management shall be credited to NDRF\u2013 Thus, the submission that it is not possible for any person orinstitution to make any contribution to the NDRF is incorrect \u2013 So,any contribution, grant of any individual or institution is notprohibited to be credited into the NDRF and it is still open for anyperson or institution to make contribution to the NDRF in terms ofs. 46(1)(b) of the Act, 2005 \u2013 Further, the contribution by any personor by any institution in PM CARES Fund is voluntary and it is openfor any person or institution to make contribution to the PM CARESFund.Disaster Management Act, 2005 \u2013 s. 46 \u2013 COVID-19

individuals/institutions to be creditedin NDRF and not to PM CARES Fund and all the funds collected inPM CARES Fund till date should be directed to be transferred toNDRF \u2013 Held: As per the new guidelines, 2015-16 expenditure fromNDRF is meant to assist a State to provide immediate relief in thosecases of severe calamity, where the expenditure required is in excessof the balance in the State\u2019s SDRMF \u2013 The Centre has released firstintalment of Rs.11,092/- crores out of 22,184/- crores which wasthe Central share of SDRMF and there is nothing on record thatany State has exceeded the expenditure in excess of the balance inthe State\u2019s SDMRF, there is no occasion of asking more fund by theState from NDRF \u2013 Whereas, the PM CARES Fund has beenconstituted as a public charitable trust in the year 2020 \u2013 Underthe guidelines which were in existence with effect from financialyear 2015-16, neither NDRF nor SDRMF covered the bioligicaland public health emergencies \u2013 No contribution by any person orinstitution in the NDRF could have been made prior to the notificationdated 14.03.2002, which notified COVID-19 as disaster \u2013 Theoutbreak of COVID-19 required immediate enhancement in theinfrastructure of medical health and creation of fund to containCOVID-19 \u2013 PM CARES Fund was constituted to have necessaryfinancial resources to meet

        "HeadNote": " Tender \u2013 Rejection of bid on ground of omission and suppression of relevant fact \u2013 Public Works Department of the State issued a Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) for the construction of an Elevated Corridor (Flyover) of a length of 7.473 Km \u2013 Eleven Companies bid for the said project including UPSBC, \u2018R\u2019 Builders and \u2018Ra\u2019 Construction Co. \u2013 The State rejected bid of UPSBC of sum of Rs. 306.27 crores on the ground that the bidder suppressed information required under paragraph 13 of Appendix-I-A and clause 7(b) of Annex-I of NIT \u2013 Hence, the bid of UPSBC was considered to be non-responsive \u2013 Likewise, \u2018Ra\u2019 Construction Co. bid for Rs. 293.25 crores did not fulfil the criteria under clause 2.2.2.2(ii) of the NIT for \u2018one similar work\u2019 of 25% of the estimated project cost and was, therefore, considered non-responsive \u2013 One \u2018R\u2019 builders had bid for Rs.315.80 crores \u2013 The High Court in the Writ Petition filed by UPSBC, held that as on date of submission of the technical bid, since no investigation was pending within the meaning of clause 7(b) of Annex-I, there was no suppression of facts, despite the fact that an FIR had been lodged against it in respect of a bridge constructed by it earlier and the bridge had collapsed killing & injuring people \u2013 The High Court directed to issue a Letter of Intent in favour of UPSBC \u2013 As far as writ petition filed by \u2018Ra\u2019 Construction Co. is concerned, the High Court referred to clause 2.2.2.2(ii) of the NIT and held that there was nothing wrong with the State\u2019s rejection \u2013 On appeal, held : The UPSBC is right when it refers and relies on the format which had to be strictly complied with and going by the literal reading of the format for providing declaration, which only required a disclosure of pending investigations under clause 7(b) of Annex-I of the NIT \u2013 However, the paragraph 13 of Appendix-I-A must be read together with paragraph 11 thereof, which required the bidder to certify that in regard to matters other than security and integrity of the country, the bidder was not convicted by a Court of law or indicted \u2013 Clearly, in the instant case, though the investigation was no longer pending and though there was no conviction by a Court of law, UPSBC was certainly \u2018indicted\u2019, in that, a charge-sheet was filed against it relatable to the FIR \u2013 So, there is an omission of a most relevant fact and suppression of the same fact, namely that an FIR was lodged against UPSBC in respect of the construction of a bridge by it \u2013 As a result, UPSBC is disqualified \u2013 As far as \u2018Ra\u2019 Construction is concerned, it will not be open for a Constitutional Court to substitute their view of the view of the tendering authority, when it reads clause 2.2.2.2(ii) in the manner that was done \u2013 Therefore, the State directed to issue Letter of Intent to \u2018R\u2019 Builders as far as present tender is concerned at the same financial bid as that of UPSBC.

limitation is the date of ordersought to be reopened and the date of issuance of show-causenotice under s.15 of the Ceiling Act of 1973.Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 \u2013 ss.30C, 30D, 30DD \u2013 Ceilinglimit \u2013 Appellant was owner of 254.2 bighas of land \u2013 On19.12.1963, he gifted away 127.1 bighas of land to his son andthereafter he was left with 17.25 standard acres of land \u2013 Proceedingwas initiated under the ceiling law but same was dropped on14.04.1972 with observation that amendment of s.30DD of the Act,1955 was effective from 31.12.1969 and since the gift deed wasexecuted before the said amendment, the said transfer was valid \u2013By notice dated 15.03.1982, the Revenue Ceiling Department re-opened the case of the appellant \u2013 Authorities held that the appellantwas holding land over and above the ceiling limit \u2013 High Court,while passing the impugned order, held the registered gift deed dated19.12.1963 to be invalid on the basis that it did not meet therequirements as provided under s.122 of the Transfer of PropertyAct, 1882 \u2013 High Court observed that gift deed did not showacceptance of gift by the donee, rather it seemed that donee waseven unaware of the gift \u2013 High Court held that appellant washolding 4.5 standard acres of land in excess of ceiling limit \u2013Aggrieved land owner filed instant appeal \u2013 Held: The recitals inthe gift deed indicated that donor intended to part with ownershipand possession immediately after the execution of the gift deed \u2013Mutation entry in the Revenue Record reflected that half portion ofappellant\u2019s land was bestowed as a gift by him to his son through aregistered instrument of gift \u2013 Even in the statement of the appellant,he has stated that the transferee-son was living separately and wascultivating the said gifted property and that he was in possession ofan ox and equipments for ploughing and agriculture \u2013 These factswere reiterated by the transferee also in his statement \u2013 Thestatements of transferor and the transferee clearly indicated thatthe transferee had the equipment and skills and was sustaininghimself as an agriculturalist \u2013 Lastly, the said transfer was executedway before the cut-off date stipulated under s.30DD i.e. 31.12.1969\u2013 Therefore, the registered gift deed was a bona fide transfersquarely covered within the ambits of s.30DD, which intended toprotect the rights of agriculturalists \u2013 The transfer of the land beingvalid under s.30DD, the ceiling area of the appellant fell within theceiling limit as

was valid in the eyes oflaw \u2013 Held: For a gift to be valid, it must be gratuitous in natureand must be made voluntarily \u2013 The said giving away implies acomplete dispossession of the ownership in the property by the donor\u2013 Acceptance of a gift by the donee can be done anytime during thelifetime of the donor \u2013 Act of receiving willingly, acceptance can beinferred by the implied conduct of the donee \u2013 The recitals in thegift deed indicated that donor intended to part with ownership andpossession immediately after the execution of the gift deed \u2013Mutation Record clearly reflected that half portion of appellant\u2019sland was bestowed as a gift by him to his son through a registeredinstrument of gift \u2013 Furthermore, the statement rendered by theappellant before the Additional District Magistrate indicated thatthe donee was already a major at the time of the execution of thegift deed and after execution of the gift deed the donee startedcultivating on the same \u2013 This statement of the appellant wascompletely supported by the statement made by the donee beforethe Additional District Magistrate in which donee had stated that,as he did not get along with his step-mother, he started livingseparately and the land was transferred to him by virtue of giftdeed was under his possession and he was cultivating the same \u2013Therefore, these circumstances clearly indicated that there was anacceptance of the gift by the donee during the lifetime of the donor\u2013 Respondents failed to bring on record any evidence to rebut thefact that the donee was in enjoyment of the property \u2013 In light ofthe same, the Single Judge Bench took a plausible view that, it wasa transfer between a father and a son and there was a validacceptance of the gift when the donee-son started living separately\u2013 Lastly, since it was registered deed bearing signature of the donorand attested by two witnesses, the requirements under s.123 of theTransfer of Property Act, 1882 were satisfied \u2013 Gift deed \u2013 RajasthanImposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act, 1973 \u2013 RajasthanTenancy Act, 1955.Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling on Agricultural Holdings Act,1973 \u2013 s.6 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: s.6 of the Ceiling Act of 1973declares that every transfer of land including by way of gift, madeon or after 26-09-1970 and before 01-01-1973, shall be deemed tohave been made to defeat the provisions of the Ceiling Act of 1973\u2013 In the instant case, the gift deed was executed on 19-12-1963,that is much before 26-09-1970 \u2013 Therefore, s.6 of the Ceiling Actof 1973 does not affect the transfer of land by the appellant-donorin favour of the donee-son \u2013 Also, there is no finding that the giftdeed in this case was actuated upon any extraneous consideration\u2013 Hence, it constituted a bona fide transfer which are exemptedfrom the rigors of s.6 of the Ceiling Act of

arrested on 04.11.2020 in connectionwith FIR registered u/s. 306 and s.34 of the IPC \u2013 It was alleged thatthe appellant had not paid an amount due to the deceased for thework which was carried out by him, as a result of which he wasunder mental pressure and he committed suicide by hanging \u2013 In thesuicide note three individuals were held responsible including theappellant \u2013 The appellant invoked jurisdiction of the High Court u/Arts. 226/227 of the Constitution and s.482 of the Cr.P.C. and soughtquashing of FIR along with other reliefs \u2013 Pending the disposal ofthe petition, the appellant filed an application and sought his releasefrom the judicial custody \u2013 The High Court held that since theappellant was in judicial custody, it was open to him avail of theremedy of bail u/s. 439 of the Cr.P.C. \u2013 The High Court declinedprima facie to consider the submission of the appellant that theallegations in the FIR, read as they stand, do not disclose thecommission of an offence u/s. 306 of the IPC \u2013 The appellant filedan appeal before the Supreme Court aggrieved by the denial of hisinterim prayer for the grant of bail \u2013 On 11.11.2020, the SupremeCourt, after reserving the judgment, ordered and directed the releaseof all the three individuals including appellant on bail pending thedisposal of the proceedings before the High Court \u2013 Held: Accordingto the spouse of the deceased, her husband was over the previoustwo years \u2018having pressure as he did not receive the money of workcarried out by him\u2019 \u2013 The deceased left behind a suicide note statingthat his \u201cmoney is stuck and following owners of respective companiesare not paying our legitimate dues\u201d \u2013 The consistent line of authorityof Supreme Court lays down that in order to bring a case within thepurview of s.306 IPC, there must be a case of suicide and in thecommission of the said offence, the person who is said to haveabetted the commission of suicide must have played an active roleby an act of instigation or by doing certain act to facilitate thecommission of suicide \u2013 Therefore, the act of abetment by the personcharged with the said offence must be proved and established bythe prosecution \u2013 In the instant case, prima facie, on the applicationof test laid down by the Supreme Court it cannot be said that theappellant was guilty of having abetted suicide within the meaningof s.306 of the IPC \u2013 The High Court in failing to notice the contentsof FIR and to make a prima facie evaluation abdicated its role,functions and jurisdiction when seized of petition u/s. 482 of Cr.P.C.\u2013As a consequence of its failure to perform its function u/s. 482 Cr.P.C.,the High Court disabled itself from exercising its jurisdiction u/Art.226to consider appellant\u2019s application for bail \u2013 While consideringapplication u/Art. 226, the High Court must be circumspect inexercising its power on the basis of the facts of each case \u2013 However,the High court should not foreclose itself from the exercise of thepower when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personalliberty in an excess of state power \u2013 Therefore, the interim protectiongranted to the accused on 11.11.2020 continue to remain in operationpending the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Constitution of India \u2013 Art.226 \u2013 Power to grant interim bail\u2013 The appellant was arrested in connection with FIR registered u/s.306 and s.34 of the IPC \u2013 Appellant filed petition u/Art.226/227 ofthe Constitution and u/s.482 of the Cr.P.C. for quashing the FIRand the arrest memo \u2013 Thereafter, the appellant filed application forinterim bail \u2013 The High Court declined to evaluate prima facie at theinterim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR as to whether anarguable case has been made out \u2013 The High Court further declinedto allow the appellant\u2019s prayer for interim bail and relegated him tothe remedy u/s.439 of Cr.P.C. \u2013 Aggrieved, the appellant filed anappeal before the Supreme Court \u2013 It was submitted by therespondents that procedural hierarchy of Courts in mattersconcerning the grant of bail needs to be respected \u2013 Held: Therespondents are right in submitting that the procedural hierarchy ofcourts in matters concerning the grant of bail needs to be respected\u2013 However, there was a failure of the High Court to discharge itsadjudicatory function at two levels \u2013 first in declining to evaluateprima facie at the interim stage in a petition for quashing the FIR asto whether an arguable case has been made out, and secondly, indeclining interim bail, as a consequence of its failure to render aprima facie opinion on the first \u2013 The High Court did have the powerto protect the citizen by an interim order in a petition invoking Art.226 \u2013 Where the High Court has failed to do so, Supreme Courtwould be abdicating its role and functions as a constitutional courtif it refuses to interfere, despite the parameters for such interferencebeing met.Words and
