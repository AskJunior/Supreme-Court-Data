Rs.9,855/ - per month \u2013 Since the deceased is survived by the seven dependents, the appropriate deduction for personal expenses for deceased ought to be 1/5th only and not 1/4th as applied by the Tribunal and High Court \u2013 Further, Tribunal erred by not making any additions to future prospects of the deceased, whereas High Court by placing reliance on Sarla Verma and Pranay Sethi held that since the deceased was under 40 years of age and was self\u0002employed, he is entitled to addition of future prospects of 40% of his established income \u2013 There is no error in High Court\u2019s reasoning for adding 40% of the deceased\u2019s income towards future prospects \u2013 Further, Tribunal awarded meagre sums of Rs.10,000/- and Rs.2,000/- towards conventional heads and funeral expenses, respectively, whereas High Court while placing reliance on Pranay Sethi awarded Rs.70,000/- under conventional heads and Rs.10,000/ - towards funeral expenses of the deceased \u2013 Although, High Court was correct in placing reliance on Pranay Sethi, High Court erred by not granting an increment of 10% on the conventional heads in every three years as directed in the Pranay Sethi \u2013 A three-Judge Bench of this Court in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Satinder Kaur after considering Pranay Sethi awarded spousal consortium at  the rate of Rs.40,000/ and towards loss of parental consortium to each child at the rate of Rs.40,000/- \u2013 The compensation under these heads also needs to be increased by 10% \u2013 Thus, the spousal consortium is awarded at Rs.44,000/ and towards parental consortium at the rate of Rs.44,000/ each is awarded to the three children \u2013 Thus the total compensation payable to the Appellants is Rs.25,91,388/- with interest at 9% per annum from the date of filing of the application till the date of payment of the compensation to the appellants. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 Beneficial Legislation \u2013 The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is a beneficial legislation which has been framed with the object of providing relief to the victims or their families \u2013 s.168 of the MV Act deals with the concept of \u2018just compensation\u2019 which ought to be determined on the foundation of fairness, reasonableness and equitability."

        ],
        "HeadNote": "Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death Sentence \u2013 Rarest of Rare case \u2013 Kidnapping, rape and murder of a seven-and-a-half-year old mentally and physically challenged girl \u2013 Case of circumstantial evidence \u2013 Trial Court found appellant-accused guilty and imposed death sentence u/s. 302 IPC \u2013 High Court found it to be a \u2018rarest of rare case\u2019 and upheld the conviction and death sentence \u2013 Appeal before the Supreme Court on two issues \u2013 First, whether concurrent findings of fact required interference \u2013 Second, whether death sentence be maintained or substituted by any other sentence \u2013 Held: On facts, the chain is so complete in itself that no stretch of imagination could take the court to any other hypothesis except the guilt of the appellant in relation to the offences charged \u2013 Hence, the concurrent findings of the trial court and the High Court holding appellant guilty are imminently just and proper; and call for no interference whatsoever \u2013 Insofar as sentence is concerned, in the present case, the crime had been of extreme depravity, which shocks the conscience, particularly looking to the target (a seven-and-a\u0002half-year old mentally and physically challenged girl) and then, looking to the manner of committing murder, where the hapless victim\u2019s head was literally smashed, resulting in multiple injuries including fracture of frontal bone \u2013 This is apart from the facts that the innocent victim was kidnapped on a stolen motorcycle by misusing the trust gained by offer of confectionary items and also, apart from the fact that she was brutally and inhumanly raped \u2013 Taking up the test parameters pertaining to the criminal (i.e., the appellant), of course, he has a family with wife and minor daughter and aged father and the crime was committed when he was only 28 years of age \u2013 However, these mitigating factors are pitted against several other factors pertaining to the appellant himself \u2013 One, being of his activities and actions before the present crime where he was  found involved in at least four cases with offences ranging from s.3 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984, s.379 IPC and even s.307 IPC \u2013 Second, being the fact that the present crime itself was carried out with the aid of a stolen motorcycle \u2013 Third, and crucial one being his conduct post-conviction where he not only earned 7 days\u2019 punishment in jail for quarrelling with a co\u0002inmate but he has also been convicted of the offence of murder of another jail inmate \u2013 A fortiori, there appears no probability of his reformation and rehabilitation \u2013 This possibility of the appellant relapsing in the same crime over again and nil probability of his reformation/rehabilitation is a direct challenge as also danger to the maintenance of order in the society \u2013 Consequently, it is a case of no other option but to confirm the death sentence awarded to the appellant \u2013 Penal Code 1860 \u2013 ss. 302, 363, 365 and 376(2)(f). Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death Sentence \u2013 Evolution of principles and norms \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss.235 and 354. Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death Sentence \u2013 Rarest of rare doctrine \u2013 Effect, if any, of death sentence being awarded and maintained only in extreme cases \u2013 Held: Even though rarest of rare doctrine and its accompanying principles, as enunciated and explained in Bachan Singh and Machhi Singh cases, have been almost uniformly applied by Courts in the country while dealing with the question of sentencing when the statute provides for death penalty; and over the time, even the proposition of larger/longer term of actual imprisonment with no remission or curtailed remission has also evolved but, it has never been the effort of the Courts to somehow make the punishment of death sentence redundant and non-existent for all practical purposes \u2013 The quest for justice in such cases, with death sentence being awarded and maintained only in extreme cases, does not mean that the matter would be approached and examined in the manner that death sentence has be avoided, even if the matter indeed calls for such a punishment \u2013 The judicial process would be compromising on its objectivity if the approach is to nullify the statutory provision carrying death sentence as an alternative punishment for major offences (like that of s.302 IPC), even after it has passed muster of judicial scrutiny and has been held not unconstitutional \u2013 The pursuit in collecting mitigating circumstances could also not be taken up with any notion or idea that somehow, some factor be found; or if not found, be deduced anyhow so that the sentence of death be forsaken \u2013 Such an approach would be unrealistic, unwarranted and rather not upholding the rule of law \u2013 Rule of law. Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Death Sentence \u2013 Post-conviction conduct \u2013 Relevance \u2013 Held: Courts have refrained from awarding or approving death sentence even in cases of gruesome killings, essentially on the premise that even a semblance of probability of reformation of the convict ought to be given a chance, rather than awarding capital punishment, which is of irretrievable nature \u2013 In this regard, the jail conduct of the convict carries its own bearing and relevance in the overall consideration; and the Supreme Court has leaned in favour of commuting the sentence of death to that of imprisonment for life in case of unblemished jail conduct, even if the crime itself had been of gruesome or abhorrent nature. Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Psychological evaluation report \u2013 Report on likelihood of reformation and rehabilitation \u2013 When may be called for \u2013 Held: In appropriate cases, after conviction, the Court may call for report to determine whether the accused could be reformed or rehabilitated; and it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case \u2013 There cannot be any universal formula for calling for such a report \u2013 In the present case, where the appellant-convict was incessantly indulged in criminal activities before the crime in question; carried out gruesome deeds of the present crime; was further involved in questionable jail conduct, including quarrelling with a fellow inmate and earning 7 days\u2019 punishment; and then also involved in murder of another jail inmate, calling for any further report of the likelihood of reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant could be proposed only if the judicial process is determined to annul the death sentence altogether, by finding one way or the other to avoid the same in every case \u2013 Such an approach would be counter-productive to the entire system of maintenance of order in the society and would strike at the roots of the rule of law \u2013 In the circumstances of the present case, the suggestions about calling for any so-called psychological evaluation report could only be termed as impractical and unrealistic and could only be rejected. Sentence / Sentencing \u2013 Sentencing principles \u2013 Crime and criminal tests \u2013 Aggravating and Mitigating circumstances \u2013 Discussed. Criminal jurisprudence \u2013 Case of circumstantial evidence \u2013 Theory of residual doubt \u2013 If available for the purpose of sentencing \u2013 Held: In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the conclusion of guilt is recorded only after the circumstances are found to be forming an unbreakable chain, so consistent as to rule out any other hypothesis except the guilt of the accused \u2013 These being stringent norms, as followed consistently by the Courts based on the panchsheel principles expounded in Sharad Birdhichand Sarda, and requirement being of the proof of the case beyond reasonable doubt, theoretically there is no scope for any \u2018residual doubt\u2019 operating even in the cases of circumstantial evidence \u2013 The cases in which theory of residual doubt has at all been referred, had been standing on their own facts, where alternative to death sentence was considered appropriate \u2013 However, while taking up the matter for sentencing, it is not expected to reopen the chain of circumstantial evidence to find any weak link which may fall in the category of residual doubt \u2013 If at all any such doubt is reasonably existing, the very basis of conviction would be in question \u2013 After the final conclusion on the guilt and after pronouncing conviction, no concept of residual doubt as such is available for the purpose of sentencing \u2013 Sentence / Sentencing."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Closure report \u2013 Procedure to be followed before accepting closure report \u2013 Held: Before accepting the closure report, the Magistrate is bound to issue notice to the complainant/original informant and the complainant/ original informant is required to be given an opportunity to submit the protest application and, thereafter, after giving an opportunity to the complainant/original informant, the Magistrate may either accept the closure report or may not accept the closure report and direct to proceed further against those persons for whom the closure report was submitted."

        "HeadNote": "Liability \u2013 Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.07.2010, followed by a sale deed, was entered into between U.P State Sugar Corporation Limited-Seller (UPSSCL) and Appellant-Purchaser for UPSSCL\u2019s loss making Amroha sugar mill \u2013 Dispute arose w.r.t outstanding liability of unpaid duty, penalty, and interest, if to be discharged by the seller or the purchaser \u2013 Subsisting dues arising out of transactions occurring on dates prior to the sale, if contingent or conditional liability or an accrued liability which may be computed or discharged at a subsequent date \u2013 Held: There is no dispute that the liability towards the duty in question for the Amroha unit are in respect of business transactions for the period anterior to the signing date of the Slump Sale Agreement \u2013 The business liability for the Amroha unit had arisen out of the operation of the unit during the period before the same was sold to the appellant, although the liability is to be quantified and discharged at a future date \u2013 When the liability is capable of being estimated with reasonable certainty, the liability is not to be treated as a contingent one and should be considered as a liability which may be discharged at a future date \u2013 Thus, the liability in question not being a contingent one, the same cannot be fastened on the purchaser who were not operating the unit, prior to the Slump Sale Agreement dated 17.7.2010 \u2013 Further, in clause 12.1 and 12.2 of the Agreement read with Clause 9 of the Sale Deed, the liability of the purchaser, for the operation and activities of the unit, arose only after the signing date \u2013 Thus, dues relating to the activities and operation of the unit upto 17.7.2010 (signing date), were the liabilities of the UPSSCL \u2013 Also, prior to 17.7.2010, the appellant was neither a dealer nor a manufacturer and therefore, had no tax or duty obligations to satisfy for the operation of the Amroha unit \u2013 Impugned order erroneously held that the liabilities for the transactions made prior to the sale agreement are to be borne by the purchaser, set aside."
