        "HeadNote": "Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961 \u2013 s.12(2)(c) \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 14, 16, 243-D and 243-T \u2013 Reservation in local self-government \u2013 Petitioners sought a declaration that s.12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, is ultra vires the provisions of Arts. 243-D and 243-T including Arts. 14 and 16 of the Constitution \u2013 In addition, the validity of notifications dated 27.07.2018 and 14.02.2020 issued by the State Election Commission providing for reservation exceeding 50 per cent in respect of Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis have been questioned \u2013 The provision in the form of s.12 of the 1961 Act enables the respondents to reserve 27 per cent of seats for persons belonging to the Backward class citizens in the concerned Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis \u2013 The respondent-State urged that the that it is permissible to reserve seats for OBCs to the extent permissible in the 1961 Act \u2013 Held: The decision of the Constitution Bench in K. Krishna Murthy required the triple test/conditions required to be complied by the State before reserving seats in local bodies for OBCs i.e. (1) to set up a dedicated Commission to conduct contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of the backwardness qua local bodies, within the State; (2) to specify the proportion of reservation required to be provisioned local body wise in light of recommendations of the Commission, so as not to fall foul of overbreadth; and (3) in any case such reservation shall not exceed aggregate of 50 per cent of the total seats reserved in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together \u2013 The said triple test conditions were not complied by the State \u2013 As regards s.12(2)(c) of the 1961 Act inserted in 1994, the plain language does give an impression that uniform and rigid quantum of 27 per cent of the total seats across the State need to be set apart by way of reservation in favour of OBCs \u2013 In light of the dictum of the Constitution Bench, such a rigid provision cannot be sustained much less having uniform application to all the local bodies within the State \u2013 The provision in the form of s.12(2)(c) can be saved by reading it down \u2013 The expression \u201cshall be\u201d preceding 27 per cent occurring in s.12(2)(c), be construed as \u201cmay be\u201d including to mean that reservation for OBCs may be up to 27 per cent but subject to the outer limit of 50 per cent aggregate in favour of SCs/STs/OBCs taken together, as enunciated by the Constitution Bench of this Court \u2013 In the instant case, no inquiry much less contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness by a dedicate Commission established by the State for the purpose was undertaken, it is not open to the State to fall back on s.12(2)(c) as enacted in 1994 \u2013 That provision is an enabling provision and would become functional and operational only upon fulfilling triple test as specified by the Constitution Bench \u2013 Thus, the impugned notifications issued by the State Election Commission reserving seats for OBCs in the concerned local bodies, suffer from the vice of foundational jurisdictional error \u2013 The impugned notifications to the extent it provides for reservation for OBCs in the concerned local bodies, is, therefore, void and without authority of law."

        "HeadNote": "Income Tax Act, 1961: s.195 \u2013 Amount paid by resident in India to non-resident foreign software suppliers \u2013 Liability to deduct tax at source \u2013 Held: In view of the definition of royalties contained in Article 12 of the DTAAs, there is no obligation on the persons mentioned in s. 195 of the Income Tax Act to deduct tax at source, as the distribution agreements/EULAs in the facts of these cases do not create any interest or right in such distributors/end-users, which would amount to the use of or right to use any copyright \u2013 The amounts paid by resident Indian end-users/distributors to non- resident computer software manufacturers/suppliers, as consideration for the resale/use of the computer software through EULAs/distribution agreements, is not the payment of royalty for the use of copyright in the computer software, and same does not give rise to any income taxable in India, as a result of which the persons referred to in s.195 of the Income Tax Act are not liable to deduct any TDS under s.195 of the Income Tax Act. Income Tax Act, 1961: s.194E and s.195 \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Held: s.194E of the Income Tax Act belongs to a set of various provisions which deal with TDS, without any reference to chargeability of tax under the Income Tax Act by the concerned non-resident assessee \u2013 This section is similar to s.193 and s.194 of the Income Tax Act by which deductions have to be made without any reference to the chargeability of a sum received by a non-resident assessee under the Income Tax Act \u2013 On the other hand, at the heart of s.195 of the Income Tax Act is the fact that deductions can only be made if the non resident assessee is liable to pay tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Act in the first place.Income Tax Act, 1961: Applicability of Income Tax Act, 1961 when DTAA applies \u2013 Held: Once a DTAA applies, the provisions of the Income Tax Act can only apply to the extent that they are more beneficial to the assessee and not otherwise \u2013 Further, by explanation 4 to s.90 of the Income Tax Act, it has been clarified by the Parliament that where any term is defined in a DTAA, the definition contained in the DTAA is to be looked at \u2013 It is only where there is no such definition that the definition in the Income Tax Act can then be applied. Income Tax Act, 1961: s.90 \u2013 Royalty \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: As is now reflected by explanation 4 to s.90 of the Income Tax Act and under Article 3(2) of the DTAA, the definition of the term \u201croyalties\u201d shall have the meaning assigned to it by the DTAA, meaning thereby that the expression \u201croyalty\u201d, when occurring in s.9 of the Income Tax Act, has to be construed with reference to Article 12 of the DTAA \u2013 This position is also clarified by CBDT Circular No. 333 dated 02.04.1982 \u2013 Thus, by virtue of Article 12(3) of the DTAA, royalties are payments of any kind received as consideration for \u201cthe use of, or the right to use, any copyright\u201d of a literary work, which includes a computer programme or software. Income Tax Act, 1961: s.9(1)(vi) explanation 4; s.195 \u2013 The question whether persons liable to deduct TDS under s.195 can be held liable to deduct such sums at a time when explanation 4 was factually not on the statute book, all deductions liable to be made and the assessment years in question being prior to the year 2012 \u2013 This question is answered by two latin maxims, lex non cogit ad impossibilia, i.e., the law does not demand the impossible and impotentia excusat legem, i.e., when there is a disability that makes it impossible to obey the law, the alleged disobedience of the law is excused \u2013 The \u201cperson\u201d mentioned in s.195 cannot be expected to do the impossible, namely, to apply the expanded definition of \u201croyalty\u201d inserted by explanation 4 to s.9(1)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, for the assessment years in question, at a time when such explanation was not actually and factually in the statute. Copyright Act, 1957: Copyright \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Though the expression \u201ccopyright\u201d has not been defined separately in the \u201cdefinitions\u201d section of the Copyright Act, yet, s.14 makes it clear that \u201ccopyright\u201d means the \u201cexclusive right\u201d, subject to the provisions of the Act, to do or authorise the doing of certain acts \u201cin respect of a work\u201d \u2013 When an \u201cauthor\u201d in relation to a \u201cliterary work\u201d which includes a \u201ccomputer programme\u201d, creates such work, such author has the exclusive right, subject to the provisions of the Copyright Act, to do or authorise the doing of several acts in respect of such work or any substantial part thereof. Copyright Act, 1957: s.14(b) \u2013 Right to use computer software \u2013 When, under a non-exclusive licence, an end-user gets the right to use computer software in the form of a CD, the end-user only receives a right to use the software and nothing more \u2013 The end- user does not get any of the rights that the owner continues to retain under s.14(b) of the Copyright Act read with sub-section (a)(i)-(vii) thereof \u2013 Thus, the conclusion that when computer software is licensed for use under an EULA, what is also licensed is the right to use the copyright embedded therein, is wholly incorrect \u2013 The licence for the use of a product under an EULA cannot be construed as the licence spoken of in s.30 of the Copyright Act, as such EULA only imposes restrictive conditions upon the end-user and does not part with any interest relatable to any rights mentioned in ss.14(a) and 14(b) of the Copyright Act. Copyright Act, 1957: ss.14, 16, 30, 52(1)(aa), 52(1)(b), 52(1)(ad) \u2013 Infringement of copyright \u2013 Held: No copyright exists in India outside the provisions of the Copyright Act or any other special law for the time being in force, vide s.16 of the Copyright Act \u2013 When the owner of copyright in a literary work assigns wholly or in part, all or any of the rights contained in s.14(a) and (b) of the Copyright Act, in the said work for a consideration, the assignee of such right becomes entitled to all such rights comprised in the copyright that is assigned, and shall be treated as the owner of the copyright of what is assigned to him \u2013 Also, under s.30 of the Copyright Act, the owner of the copyright in any literary work may grant any interest in any right mentioned in s.14(a) of the Copyright Act by licence in writing by him to the licensee, under which, for parting with such interest, royalty may become payable \u2013 When such licence is granted, copyright is infringed when any use, relatable to the said interest/right that is licensed, is contrary to the conditions of the licence so granted \u2013 Infringement of copyright takes place when a person \u201cmakes for sale or hire or sells or lets for hire\u201d or\u201coffers for sale or hire\u201d or \u201cdistributes...so as to affect prejudicially the owner of the copyright\u201d, vide s.51(b) of the Copyright Act \u2013 Importantly, the making of copies or adaptation of a computer programme in order to utilise the said computer programme for the purpose for which it was supplied, or to make up back-up copies as a temporary protection against loss, destruction or damage so as to be able to utilise the computer programme for the purpose for which it was supplied, does not constitute an act of infringement of copyright under s.52(1)(aa) of the Copyright Act \u2013 In short, what is referred to in s.52(1)(aa) of the Copyright Act would not amount to reproduction so as to amount to an infringement of copyright \u2013 s.52(1)(ad) is independent of s.52(1)(aa) of the Copyright Act, and states that the making of copies of a computer programme from a personally legally obtained copy for non-commercial personal use would not amount to an infringement of copyright \u2013 s.52(1)(ad) of the Copyright Act cannot be read to negate the effect of s.52(1)(aa), since it deals with a subject matter that is separate and distinct from that contained in s.52(1)(aa) of the Copyright Act. Copyright Act, 1957: Copyright owner\u2019s distribution right and the right of the purchaser to further resale \u2013 Doctrine of first sale/ principle of exhaustion \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: s.14(b)(ii) of the Copyright Act was amended twice, first in 1994 and then again in 1999, with effect from 15.01.2000 \u2013 After the 1999 Amendment, what is conspicuous by its absence is the phrase \u201cregardless of whether such copy has been sold or given on hire on earlier occasions\u201d \u2013 This is a statutory recognition of the doctrine of first sale/principle of exhaustion. Words and Phrases: Expression \u2018in respect of \u2019 \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Also in context of explanation 2(v) to s.9(1)(vi) of the Income Tax Act \u2013 Held: The expression \u201cin respect of\u201d, when used in a taxation statute, is only synonymous with the words \u201con\u201d or \u201cattributable to\u201d \u2013 Such meaning accords with the meaning to be given to the expression \u201cin respect of\u201d contained in explanation 2(v) to s.9(1)(vi) of the Income Tax Act, and would not in any manner make the expression otiose."

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 The appellant submitted a resolution plan for a company which was undergoing the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) under the 2016 Code \u2013 The Resolution Plan was approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) \u2013 Accordingly, the appellant deposited an amount of Rs.5 crores in an escrow account of the corporate debtor \u2013 However, further obligations were not fulfilled by the appellant under the Resolution Plan despite numerous opportunities \u2013 As a result on 11.11.2019, the CoC voted for the liquidation of the corporate debtor \u2013 The same was allowed by the NCLT \u2013 In appeal, the NCLAT permitted appellant to deposit Rs.15 crores in the escrow account and appellant agreed to the stipulation that the amount of Rs.15 crores would be forfeited if it failed to deposit the payment of Rs. 50 crores \u2013 On 08.09.2020, the appeal was dismissed and NCLAT upheld the order of liquidation \u2013 Before the Supreme Court on 09.10.2020, the appellant stated that an amount of Rs.50 crores would be deposited on or before 10.01.2021 \u2013 The appellant was specifically informed that if it failed to do so in whole or in part, the entire amount of Rs.20 crores deposited earlier would be forfeited \u2013 Thereafter, the time for making the deposit was extended until 25.02.2021 \u2013 However, several months elapsed after extension of time and no payments were made \u2013 Appellant submitted that it has moved to term lenders for finance \u2013 However, before finance can be made available to the appellant, the term lenders insisted that the status of the company must be altered from that of a company under liquidation, to an active company \u2013 Held : The appellant was unable to raise the funds \u2013 The fact of the matter emerges that the appellant will be unable to raise funds from the term lenders, who were insisting on changing the status of company from under liquidation to an active status \u2013 The order of liquidation was not set aside \u2013 What the request of the appellant reduces itself to, is that it would raise funds on a mortgage of assets of the company and unless the company is bought out of liquidation, it would not be in a position to raise the funds \u2013 This cannot be accepted \u2013 The order of liquidation was stayed and a final view is yet to be taken \u2013 Sufficient opportunities were granted to the appellant and it was not able to deposit Rs.50 crores \u2013 The appellant has failed to abide by its obligations \u2013 The consequence envisaged under the order of the Supreme Court accordingly ensue the forfeiture of the amount of Rs.20 crores \u2013 As a consequence, the management directed to revert to the liquidator for taking steps in accordance with law."

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860: s.302 \u2013 Conviction based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Prosecution case was that the appellant was addicted to liquor and used to abuse and beat his wife forcing her to get money from her mother \u2013 On the fateful night, the appellant and his wife went to sleep in their house \u2013 Next day morning, when the brother of the appellant went to call the appellant for going to field for harvesting crop, appellant informed him that his wife committed suicide by hanging \u2013 Trial court convicted appellant under s.302 and sentenced him to imprisonment for life \u2013 High Court upheld the said order \u2013 On appeal, held: The medical expert who conducted the autopsy admitted that the rope, which was found on the spot, could have been used for suicidal hanging of the deceased \u2013 He further stated that in case of homicidal strangulation, the bodily resistance would be reflected \u2013 Admittedly, there were no marks on the body to suggest violence or struggle \u2013 In any case, the medical expert himself did not rule out the possibility of suicidal death \u2013 In the light of this evidence, trial court as well as High Court erred in holding that the prosecution proved that the death of the deceased was homicidal \u2013 The motive relied on by prosecution was ill-treatment by the appellant meted out to the deceased for not arranging money from her mother \u2013 PW-3, mother of the deceased stated that appellant and deceased had been to her house and stayed for four days few days prior to the incident \u2013 This showed that the relations between the deceased and appellant were cordial \u2013 Thus, it was not safe to rely on the uncorroborated evidence of such a witness \u2013 Also, prosecution sought to rely on the evidence of PW-1 \u2013 However, his evidence was full of improvements and omissions \u2013 Even trial court and High Court disbelieved his evidence \u2013 Thus, prosecution utterly failed to prove motive beyond doubt \u2013 As such, an important link to complete the chain of circumstances was totally absent \u2013 Prosecution failed to prove a single incriminating circumstance beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 Conviction and sentence passed by trial court as affirmed by High Court is set aside and appellant is acquitted of all the charges. Evidence Act, 1872: s.106 \u2013 Burden to prove \u2013 s.106 does not directly operate against either a husband or wife staying under the same roof and being the last person seen with the deceased \u2013 s.106 does not absolve the prosecution of discharging its primary burden of proving the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt \u2013 It is only when the prosecution has led evidence which, if believed, will sustain a conviction, or which makes out a prima facie case, that the question arises of considering facts of which the burden of proof would lie upon the accused \u2013 In the instant case, the prosecution has even failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death was homicidal. Criminal law: Motive \u2013 Though in a case of direct evidence, motive would not be relevant, in a case of circumstantial evidence, motive plays an important link to complete the chain of circumstances. Criminal law: False explanation or non-explanation can only be used as an additional circumstance, when the prosecution has proved the chain of circumstances leading to no other conclusion than the guilt of the accused \u2013 However, it cannot be used as a link to complete the chain. Criminal law: Two views \u2013 If two views are possible, the benefit shall always go to the accused."

Arts. 243T, 243ZA, 243ZG \u2013 Elections to the Municipal Councils \u2013 Postponment of elections to 11 Municipal Councils by Goa State Election Commission (SEC) in view of COVID-19 pandemic situation \u2013 Law Secretary of Government of Goa appointed as State Election Commissioner, which duties were in addition to his duties as Law Secretary \u2013 By Notification, election postponed for three months \u2013 Thereafter, on 04.02.21, amendment made to s. 10(1) of the Act whereby time frame for issuance of Notifications for reservation of wards was stated as being at least seven days before the notification of schedule of dates and events of elections \u2013 On the same day, issuance of order for reservation of wards for 11 Municipal Councils, by Director of Municipal Administrator \u2013 Writ petitions challenging amendment to s. 10(1) and the order dated 04.02.21 \u2013 On 22.2.2021, Notification was issued out at 9.00 am and presented to the Goa Bench, by which elections to the 11 Municipal Councils commenced \u2013 Thereafter, on 04.03.21, Notification issued by the SEC altering the original schedule of elections \u2013 High Court quashed the order dated 04.02.21 and issued direction to the Director to issue Notification within period of 10 days; and to SEC to notify election programme \u2013 Interference with \u2013 Held: Not called for \u2013 High Court rightly ignored the constitutional bar in arriving at the conclusion that the 04.02.2021 order is illegal and ultra vires the provisions of Art. 243T r/w ss. 9 and 10 of the Act \u2013 SEC is not an independent body as is mandated by Art.243K but is a Law Secretary to the Government of Goa \u2013 Thus, the whole process of these elections was faulted at the start \u2013 SEC had itself postponed the municipal elections twice due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 On facts, due application of mind could not have been bestowed before issuing the order dated 4.2.21 \u2013 When the High Court issued notice on 15.02.2021 for final hearing on 22.02.2021, the SEC did not inform the High Court that vide a note of 05.02.2021, elections were proposed to be held on 20.03.2021 \u2013 Furthermore, in a clear attempt to overreach the High Court, SEC issued an election notification at 9:00 a.m. on 22.02.2021, even before the Government offices open at 9:30 a.m. in order to forestall the hearing of the writ petitions filed before the High Court \u2013 On 04.03.2021, SEC had rescheduled the election \u2013 Goa Municipalities Act, 1968 \u2013 ss. 9, 10 and 22 \u2013 Elections. Art. 243ZA(1) \u2013 Election to Municipalities \u2013 Powers exercised by the State Election Commission (SEC) under Art. 243ZA(1) \u2013 Held: The entire supervision and conduct of elections to municipalities is vested in a constitutional authority-SEC \u2013 SEC gives orders and directions to the State Government as well as authorities that are set up under State statutes for supervision and conduct of elections \u2013 SEC also fills in gap where there is no law or rule governing a particular situation during the conduct of an election \u2013 SEC being an independent constitutional functionary is not only to be obeyed by the State Government and the other authorities under local State statutes, but can also approach the writ court u/Arts. 226 and 227 to either enforce directions or orders issued by it or to ask for appropriate orders from High Courts in that behalf.Arts. 243ZG(a)/329(a) \u2013 Bar to interference by Court in electoral matters \u2013 Delimitation and allocation of seats \u2013 Held: Bar contained in Art. 243ZG(a) operates together with the non-obstante clause contained therein to bar all courts from interfering with State statutes dealing with delimitation and allocation of seats, just as is the bar contained in Art. 329(a) \u2013 Constitutional bar of Art. 243ZG(a) applies only to courts and not the State Election Commission. Arts. 243ZG(a), 243ZA \u2013 Municipal elections \u2013 Consecptus of \u2013 Held: Under Art. 243 ZG(b), no election to any municipality can be called in question except by an election petition presented to a Tribunal \u2013 From the date of notification of the election till the date of the declaration of result a judicial hands-off is mandated debarring the writ court u/Arts. 226 and 227 from interfering once the election process has begun until it is over \u2013 Constitutional bar operates only during this period \u2013 Thus, discretion is exercised by the writ court as to whether an interference is called for when the electoral process is \u201cimminent\u201d- notification for elections is yet to be announced \u2013 However, if the assistance of a writ court is required in subserving the progress of the election and facilitating its completion, the writ court may issue orders \u2013 Furthermore, Art. 243ZG does not operate as a bar after the election tribunal decides an election dispute before it \u2013 Thus, the jurisdiction of the High Courts u/Art. 226 and 227 and that of the Supreme Court u/Art. 136 is not affected \u2013 Under Art. 243ZA(1), if there is a constitutional or statutory infraction by any authority either before or during the election process, SEC can set right such infraction \u2013 SEC can direct the State Government or other authority to follow the Constitution or legislative enactment \u2013 It can also approach a writ court to issue necessary directions in this behalf \u2013 Judicial review of a State Election Commission\u2019s order is also available on grounds of review of administrative orders."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.195(1)(b)(i) \u2013 Whether an offence u/s.193, IPC committed at the stage of investigation, prior to production of the false evidence before the trial Court by a person who is not yet party to proceedings before the Trial Court, is an offence \u201cin relation to\u201d a proceeding in any court u/s. 195(1)(b)(i), Cr.P.C. \u2013 Held: The words \u201cin relation to\u201d u/s. 195(1)(b(i) appear to encompass situations wherein false evidence has been fabricated prior to being produced before a Court of law, for the purpose of being used in proceedings before the Court \u2013 The Construction of the words \u201cin relation to\u201d must be controlled by the overarching principle as stated in Patel Laljibhai Somabhai and Sachida Nanda Singh, which was affirmed by the Constitution Bench in Iqbal Singh Marwah \u2013 That is, even if the offence is committed prior to giving of the fabricated evidence in the Court, it must have a direct or reasonably close nexus with the court proceedings.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.195(1)(b)(i) \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.193 \u2013 Whether the words \u201cstage of a judicial proceeding\u201d under Explanation 2 to s.193, IPC can be equated with \u201cproceeding in any court\u201d u/s.195(1)(b)(i), Cr.P.C. \u2013 Held: The purpose of s.195(1)(b)(i), Cr.P.C., there must be an intention on part of the alleged offender to directly mislead the Court into forming a certain opinion by commission of offence u/s.193, IPC \u2013 Though a criminal investigation is certainly a stage of a judicial proceeding insofar as it may culminate in issue of process and trial against the accused, it would not be a proceeding in relation to a certain Court u/s.195(1)(b)(i), Cr.P.C. before the Court has even taken judicial notice of such investigation \u2013 The difference between a \u201cstage\u201d of a judicial proceeding and the judicial proceeding itself must be emphasized in this regard. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.195(1)(b)(i) and s.195(1)(b)(ii) \u2013 Difference between \u2013 Held: There is a pertinent difference in the wording of s.195(1)(b)(i) and s.195(1)(b)(ii) inasmuch as s.195(1)(b)(ii) is restricted to offences which are committed in respect of a document which is \u201cproduced or given in evidence in a proceeding in any court\u201d \u2013 Whereas s.195(1)(b)(i) applies to offences against public justice which are committed not only in any proceeding in any court, but also \u201cin relation to\u201d such proceeding"

CM recommended for the cancellation of exam and a notification was issued for cancellation of exam \u2013 Central Administrative Tribunal set aside the said cancellation notification holding that the appointments would be subject to ACB Investigation \u2013 High Court while upholding the order of the Tribunal, confined the relief to only six applicants who approached the Tribunal \u2013 On appeal, held: A fair and reasonable process of selection to posts subject to the norm of equality of opportunity u/Art. 16(1) is a constitutional requirement \u2013 Where the recruitment to public employment stands vitiated as a consequence of systemic fraud or irregularities, the entire process becomes illegitimate \u2013 The requirement that a public body must act in fair and reasonable terms animates the entire process of selection \u2013 Recruitment to public service must command public confidence \u2013 In the present case, the report of the Committee dwells on: (i) The delay of five years in holding the Tier-I examination after the advertisement was released in 2009; and (ii) The issuance of admit cards only through the electronic mode, which was not prescribed in the advertisement \u2013 Besides other irregularities, Committee also noted that there was a racket which had led to the impersonation of candidates \u2013 There was absence of randomization, many cases had emerged where two or more members of a single family sat in consecutive order and were falling under the zone of probable selection \u2013 The Committee found that the videography was blurred, thumb impressions were unrecognizable, jammers were not working properly and candidates were allowed to appear irrespective of their educational qualifications \u2013 Further, it was noted that allegations of flying squad members passing answers onto candidates \u2013 Considering all the irregularities, the Secretary Vigilance also opined that the entire process of recruitment appeared to be vitiated \u2013 There was a denial of equal access to the Tier-l examination and the allegations showed that the credibility of the process itself had been eroded \u2013 In such a situation, where a decision is taken by the Government to cancel the entire process, it cannot be held to be irrational or arbitrary, applying the yardstick of fair procedure and proportionality to the decision-making process \u2013 Both the judgments of High Court and the Tribunal are unsustainable. Constitution of India \u2013 Article 16(1) \u2013 Equality of opportunity \u2013 Public Employment \u2013 irregularities \u2013 Held: A fair and reasonable process of selection to posts subject to the norm of equality of opportunity u/Art. 16(1) is a constitutional requirement \u2013 Where the recruitment to public employment stands vitiated as a consequence of systemic fraud or irregularities, the entire process becomes illegitimate. Constitution of India \u2013 Article 14 \u2013 Right To Equality \u2013 Recruitment \u2013 Held: The constitutional values which undergird Articles 14 and 16 mandate that selection processes conducted by public authorities to make recruitments have to be fair, transparent and accountable \u2013 A fair and reasonable process is a fundamental requirement of Article 14 \u2013 Where it is possible to segregate persons who have indulged in mal-practices and to penalise them for their wrong- doing, it would be unfair to impose the burden of their wrong- doing on those who are free from taint \u2013 To treat the innocent and the wrong-doers equally by subjecting the former to the consequence of the cancellation of the entire process would be contrary to Article 14 because unequals would then be treated equally.Service Law \u2013 Recruitment \u2013 Irregularities in Examination \u2013 Position in Law \u2013 discussed."
