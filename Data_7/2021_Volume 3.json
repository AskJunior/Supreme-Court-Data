Constitution of India: Art. 12 \u2013 State \u2013 Unlawful Possession \u2013 Held : WBMDTCL, which is a \u201cState\u201d within the meaning of Art. 12 of Constitution of India, continued in unlawful possession of the premises since 15.08.1998 without paying a single pie towards compensation till date \u2013 Therefore, arbitrator is appointed to determine the compensation that is payable by way of damages for occupation of the premises without any authority of law."

Enactment of \u2013 Salutary objectives of good corporate governance and respect for and adherence to the rule of law; and re-organization and resolution of insolvencies under \u2013 Held: Can be achieved if the integrity of the resolution process is placed at the forefront \u2013 Purposive interpretation is required by the courts, while infusing meaning and content to its provisions, to ensure that the problems which beset the earlier regime do not enter through the backdoor through disingenuous stratagems. s. 29A \u2013 Person not eligible to be resolution applicant \u2013 Purpose of the ineligibility under \u2013 Held: Is to achieve a sustainable revival and to ensure that a person who is the cause of the problem either by a design or a default cannot be a part of the process of solution \u2013 s. 29A encompasses not only conduct in relation to the corporate debtor but in relation to other companies as well. ss. 29A, 35(1)(f) \u2013 Interplay between the proposal of a scheme of compromise and arrangement u/s.230 of the Act of 2013 and liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC \u2013 Held: s. 230 of the Act of 2013 is wider in its ambit \u2013 It is not confined only to a company in liquidation or to corporate debtor which is being wound up under Chapter III of the IBC \u2013 Thus, the rigors of the IBC will not apply to proceedings u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 where the scheme of compromise or arrangement proposed is in relation to an entity which is not the subject of a proceeding under the IBC \u2013 However, where s. 230 of the Act of 2013 traces its origin to the liquidation proceedings initiated under IBC, harmonious construction is needed between the two statutes which would ensure that a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 is being pursued, in a manner consistent with the underlying principles of the IBC \u2013 It would lead to a manifest absurdity if the very persons who are ineligible for submitting a resolution plan, participating in the sale of assets of the company in liquidation, are somehow permitted to propose a compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013 \u2013 IBC has made a provision for ineligibility u/s. 29A which operates during the course of the CIRP \u2013 Similar provision, s. 35(1)(f) forms a part of the liquidation provisions contained in Chapter III as well \u2013 In the context of the statutory linkage provided by the provisions of s. 230 of the Act of 2013 with Chapter III of the IBC, it would be far- fetched to hold that the ineligibilities which attach u/s. 35(1)(f) r/w s. 29A would not apply when s. 230 is sought to be invoked \u2013 Such an interpretation would result in defeating the provisions of the IBC and must be eschewed \u2013 Stages of submitting a resolution plan, selling assets of a company in liquidation and selling the company as a going concern during liquidation, all indicate that the promoter or those in the management of the company must not be allowed a back-door entry in the company and are hence, ineligible to participate during these stages \u2013 Proposing a scheme of compromise or arrangement u/s. 230 of the Act of 2013, while the company is undergoing liquidation under the provisions of the IBC lies in a similar continuum \u2013 Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 ss. 230 to 232. ss. 6 to 32A \u2013 Modes of revival of a company under the provisions of the IBC \u2013 Explained."

FIR: A cryptic phone call without complete information or containing part-information about the commission of a cognizable offence cannot always be treated as an FIR \u2013 A mere message or a telephonic message which does not clearly specify the offence, cannot be treated as an FIR \u2013 In the instant case, the intimation given by two individuals merely set out the bare facts of an attack; the information was incomplete; neither the name of the victim nor the names of the alleged attackers nor even the precise location where the incident occurred were mentioned \u2013 High Court, in the appeal before it, correctly inferred that the first information recorded at 17.45 hrs could not be treated as an FIR \u2013 In these circumstances, the details of the event which occurred, the nature of the attack, the place of the attack, the names and identities of the accused were set out fully when PW-1 recorded the statement at 23.45 hrs that constitutes the FIR."

Roshan Lal and others, which was the basis of the decision in the present matters, had in turn relied upon the assessment made by the High Court in its earlier in Madan Pal III \u2013 Since the assessment in Madan Pal III was scaled down by this Court in Wazir and Another v. State of Haryana, theoretically, the market value arrived at by the High Court in Roshan Lal case would be on the higher side \u2013 The acquisition in Roshan Lal case was a year before the present acquisition \u2013 If the lands in both cases were otherwise identical in material terms, the valuation found with respect to the former in the year 2004, must have undergone some upward change when the valuation of the latter set of lands is to be considered for the year 2005 \u2013 Although, the decision in Roshan Lal was not challenged by the State, the fact remains that the values assessed in that decision were theoretically on a higher scale and the landholders, on that score, have received an advantage \u2013 In totality of circumstances, the landholders must be held entitled to 8% flat increase over the market value assessed in HSIIDC v. Roshan Lal and others in respect of lands from villages which were found to be comparable \u2013 The landholders must therefore get enhancement to the tune of 8% over Rs.43.61 lakhs per acre \u2013 They shall also be entitled to all the statutory benefits."

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.7 \u2013 Some original lenders of the corporate debtor, assigned the debts owed to them by the corporate debtor to the appellant \u2013 Appellant took actual physical possession of project assets of the corporate debtor under the SARFAESI Act and filed application u/s.7 of IBC before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for default from the corporate debtor \u2013 As the relevant form indicating the date of default did not indicate any such date, this was subsequently made up by the appellant by filing a supplementary affidavit before the NCLT, specifically mentioning the date of default and annexing copies of balance sheets of the corporate debtor, which, according to the appellant, acknowledged periodically the debt that was due \u2013 NCLT admitted the s.7 application, observing that balance sheets of the corporate debtor, wherein it acknowledged its liability, were signed before expiry of three years from the date of default, and entries in such balance sheets being acknowledgements of the debt due for purposes of s.18 of the Limitation Act, the s.7 application was not barred by limitation \u2013 Whether entries in balance sheets of a corporate debtor would amount to acknowledgement of debt for purpose of extending limitation u/s.18 of the Limitation Act \u2013 Held: An entry made in the books of accounts, including the balance sheet, can amount to an acknowledgement of liability within the meaning of s.18 of the Limitation Act \u2013 Though the filing of a balance sheet is by compulsion of law, the acknowledgement of a debt is not necessarily so \u2013 Provisions of the Companies Act show that filing of a balance sheet in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act is mandatory, any transgression of the same being punishable by law \u2013 However, what is of importance is that notes that are annexed to or forming part of such financial statements are expressly recognised by s.134(7) \u2013 Equally, the auditor\u2019s report may also enter caveats with regard to acknowledgements made in the books of accounts including the balance sheet \u2013 Thus, there is a compulsion in law to prepare a balance sheet but no compulsion to make any particular admission, as it would depend on the facts of each case as to whether an entry made in a balance sheet qua any particular creditor is unequivocal or has been entered into with caveats, which then has to be examined on a case by case basis to establish whether an acknowledgement of liability has, in fact, been made, thereby extending limitation u/s.18 of the Limitation Act \u2013 Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 s.18 \u2013 Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 ss.2(40), 90, 128, 129, 134 and 137 \u2013 Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.238A \u2013 Whether s.18 of the Limitation Act, which extends the period of limitation depending upon an acknowledgement of debt made in writing and signed by the corporate debtor, is also applicable under s.238A, given the expression \u201cas far as may be\u201d governing the applicability of the Limitation Act to the IBC \u2013 Held: The aforesaid question is no longer res integra as two recent judgments of this Court have applied the provisions of s.14 and s.18 of the Limitation Act to the IBC \u2013 Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 s.18. Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 s.9 \u2013 Principle of s.9 of the Limitation Act is to be strictly adhered to, namely, that when time begins to run, it cannot be halted, except by a process known to law. Precedents \u2013 Binding precedent \u2013 Rule of stare decisis \u2013 Every argumentative novelty does not undo a settled position of law \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 141."

Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995: s.33 \u2013 Whether reservation under s.33 of the 1995 Act is dependent upon identification of posts as stipulated by s.32 \u2013 Held: It was never the intention of the legislature that the provisions of s.32 would be used as a tool to frustrate the benefits of reservation under s.33 \u2013 In fact, identification of posts for purposes of reservation had to take place immediately after the 1995 Act \u2013 A resistance to such reservation is obvious from the delaying tactics adopted by most of the government authorities in truly implementing the intent \u2013 What is required is identification of posts in every establishment until exempted under proviso to s.33 \u2013 No doubt the identification of the posts was a prerequisite to appointment, but then the appointment cannot be frustrated by refusing to comply with the prerequisite. Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995: s.32 \u2013 In absence of aprovision in the Rules for reservation in promotion for PwD, whether promotion can be denied to a PwD \u2013 No doubt, the mandate of s.32 of the 1995 Act enjoins the government to identify posts that can be filled up with persons with disability \u2013 Thus, even posts in promotional cadre have to be identified for PwD and such posts have to be reserved for PwD \u2013 The identification of such posts is no doubt a prerequisite for reservation in promotion for PwD \u2013 There cannot be methodology used to defeat the reservation in promotion \u2013 Once that post is identified, the logical conclusion would be that it would be reserved for PwD who have been promoted \u2013 The absence of rules to provide for reservation in promotion would not defeat the rights of PwD to a reservation in promotion as it flows from the legislation. Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995: Whether the Respondent can be promoted by giving benefit of reservation as she is a PwD, despite the fact that she was not appointed in the PwD quota \u2013 The 1995 Act does not make a distinction between a person who may have entered service on account of disability and a person who may have acquired disability after having entered the service \u2013 Similarly, the same position would be with the person who may have entered service on a claim of a compassionate appointment \u2013 The mode of entry in service cannot be a ground to make out a case of discriminatory promotion."

        "HeadNote": "Constitution of India: Art. 226 \u2013 Power of High Courts to issue writ \u2013 Award of Concession Agreement to two companies- RMGL and RMSGL respectively by Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran-HSVP for developing metro rail \u2013 Meanwhile direction by State of Haryana that all metro projects would be handled by the first respondent \u2013 Thereafter, issuance of termination notice by RMGL and RMSGL to HSVP to bring an end to the Concession Agreement upon expiry of 90 days from delivery of the termination \u2013 Thereafter, HSVP issued their termination notices to RMGL and RMGSL, directing them to hand over the projects to HMRTC \u2013 However, since RMGL and RMGSL were entities of a group categorised in the Red category, they were to seek approval before transferring or encumbering any assets \u2013 Subsequently, RMGL and RMGSL permitted to handover possession and control of metro project to HSVP pursuant to termination of the Agreement \u2013 On the same day, writ petition u/Art. 226 by HSVP and HMRTC challenging the notice of termination on the ground that it was against public interest \u2013 High Court granted interim direction for continuance of the operation of metro project for 30 days, which was further extended and during which the debt due under the financing documents in terms of concession agreements was to be determined by the auditor and then HSVP was to deposit 80 % of the debt due as determined in an Escrow Account in terms of Concession Agreement, which would be subject to order of NCLAT or any other court \u2013 On appeal, held: Exercise of writ jurisdiction by the High Court u/Art. 226 was justified since non-interference, which would have inevitably led to the disruption of rapid metro lines for Gurgaon, would have had disastrous consequences for the general public \u2013 However, ordinarily the High Court in its jurisdiction u/Art. 226 would decline to entertain a dispute which is arbitrable \u2013 Directions contained in the High Court\u2019s consent order makes it clear that the audit team appointed by CAG was to conduct a financial audit of the debt due and to examine the scope of the audit, the audit being completed within 30 days and 80 % of the debt due being deposited within 30 days after the receipt of the audit report; and that the rest of the disputes between the parties arising out of the audit report were to be agitated in arbitration \u2013 HSPV and HMRTC could not avoid compliance with the High Court\u2019s Consent Order since they willingly agreed to pay 80% of the debt due as per the auditor\u2019s findings \u2013 HSPV to deposit 80% of the amount within 3 months \u2013 Amount to be maintained in the Escrow Account subject to the orders of NCLAT or any other competent authority \u2013 RMGL and RMGSL on the one hand and HSVP on the other hand, at liberty to pursue their rights and remedies in pursuance of the arbitration clause."

Customs Act, 1962: s.28(4) \u2013 Power to review \u2013 The nature of the power to recover the duty, not paid or short paid after the goods have been assessed and cleared for import, is broadly a power to review the earlier decision of assessment \u2013 Such a power is not inherent in any authority \u2013 The power has been so conferred specifically on \u201cthe proper officer\u201d which must necessarily mean the proper officer who, in the first instance, assessed and cleared the goods \u2013 It is completely impermissible to allow an officer, who has not passed the original order of assessment, to re-open the assessment on the grounds that the duty was not paid/not levied, by the original officer who had decided to clear the goods and who was competent and authorised to make the assessment \u2013 The nature of the power conferred by s.28(4) to recover duties which have escaped assessment is in the nature of an administrative review of an act \u2013 The section must, therefore, be construed as conferring the power of such review on the same officer or his successor or any other officer who has been assigned the function of assessment \u2013 In other words, an officer who did the assessment, could only undertake re-assessment \u2013 It is, therefore, clear that the Additional Director General of DRI was not \u201cthe\u201d proper officer to exercise the power under s.28(4) and the initiation of the recovery proceedings in this case is without any jurisdiction and liable to be set aside \u2013 Tax/Taxation.Customs Act, 1962: s.6 \u2013 Import of cameras \u2013 Deputy Commissioner of Customs checked the goods and took a decision to clear the goods as being exempt from duty \u2013 Show cause notice issued under s.28(4) by Additional Director General, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence alleging that the Customs Authorities had been induced to clear the cameras by wilful mis-statement and suppression of facts about the cameras \u2013 Whether the Additional Director General of the DRI was even a proper officer \u2013 Held: The Additional Director General can be considered to be a proper officer only if it is shown that he was a Customs officer under the Customs Act \u2013 It is obvious that the re-assessment and recovery of duties i.e. contemplated by s.28(4) is by the same authority and not by any superior authority such as Appellate or Revisional Authority \u2013 It is, therefore, clear that the Additional Director General of DRI was not \u201cthe\u201d proper officer to exercise the power under s.28(4) \u2013 If it was intended that officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence who are officers of Central Government should be entrusted with functions of the Customs officers, it was imperative that the Central Government should have done so in exercise of its power under s.6 of the Act \u2013 The entire proceeding in the present case initiated by the Additional Director General of the DRI by issuing show cause notices in all the matters are invalid without any authority of law and liable to be set-aside and the ensuing demands are also set- aside. Customs Act, 1962: s.28(4) \u2013 Limitation \u2013 Suppression of facts \u2013 Invocation of extended period of limitation \u2013 Held: On facts, importer had asked for a first check and had shown the cameras along with Bill of Entry and literature detailing specifications of models \u2013 The custom authorities could have operated the cameras to see the length of time of the single sequence and whether recording of the single sequence exhausted the total memory of the camera (including extended memory) and whether the cameras were eligible for exemption \u2013 In such circumstances, it cannot be said that there was any wilful mis-statement of facts \u2013 It must, therefore, follow that the extended period of limitation of five years was not available to any authority to re-open under s.28(4). Interpretation of statutes: It is well known that when a statute directs that the things be done in a certain way, it must be done in that way alone \u2013 Customs Act, 1962 \u2013 s.28(4). Interpretation of statutes:"

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Object and Reasons of the enactment of the Code \u2013 Held : Is to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time bound manner, for maximization of the value of the assets of such persons, to promote entrepreneurship, availability of credit and to balance the interest of all the stakeholders. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.7 \u2013 Application under \u2013 When any corporate debtor commits a default, a financial creditor, an operational creditor or the corporate debtor itself may initiate corporate insolvency resolution process in respect of such corporate debtor, in such manner as provided in Chapter II of the IBC \u2013 A financial creditor may either by itself or jointly with other financial creditors, as may be notified by the Government, file an application for initiation of the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor before the Adjudicating Authority, when a default has occurred \u2013 The trigger point for an application under s.7 of the IBC is the occurrence of a default. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: Applicability of Limitation Act to application made under the Code before the NCLT \u2013 Held: There is no specific period of limitation prescribed in the Limitation Act, 1963 for an application under the IBC before the NCLT \u2013 An application for which no period of limitation is provided anywhere else in the Schedule, is governed by Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act \u2013 Under Art.137 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act, the period of limitation prescribed for such an application is three years from the date of accrual of the right to apply \u2013 Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 Art.137Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 \u2013 Delay in filing appeal/any application \u2013 s.5 of the Limitation Act provides that any appeal or any application, other than an application under any of the provisions of Order XXI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, may be admitted after the prescribed period of limitation, if the appellant or the applicant satisfies the Court, that he had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period \u2013 Explanation in s.5 of the Limitation Act clarifies that, the fact that the appellant or the applicant may have been misled by any order, practice or judgment of the High Court in ascertaining or computing the prescribed period, may be sufficient cause within the meaning of this Section. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 \u2013 Condonation of delay in filing an application or appeal \u2013 The condition precedent for condonation of the delay in filing an application or appeal, is the existence of sufficient cause \u2013 Whether the explanation furnished for the delay would constitute \u2018sufficient cause\u2019 or not would depend upon facts of each case \u2013 There cannot be any straight jacket formula for accepting or rejecting the explanation furnished by the applicant/ appellant for the delay in taking steps \u2013 Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception, when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fides can be imputed to the defaulting party. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 \u2013 Requirement to file application, not mandatory \u2013 s.5 of the Limitation Act does not speak of any application \u2013 Although, it is the general practice to make a formal application under s.5, in order to enable the Court or Tribunal to weigh the sufficiency of the cause for the inability of the appellant/ applicant to approach the Court/Tribunal within the time prescribed by limitation, there is no bar to exercise by the Court/Tribunal of its discretion to condone delay, in the absence of a formal application \u2013 A plain reading of s.5 makes it amply clear that it is not mandatory to file an application in writing before relief can be granted under the said section \u2013 Had such an application been mandatory, s.5 of the Limitation Act would have expressly provided so. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14(2) \u2013 Exclusion of period for commutation of limitation period \u2013 Held: In computing the period of limitation for any application, the time during which the petitioner had been prosecuting, with due diligence, another civil proceeding, whether in a court of first instance, or of appeal or revision, against the same party, for the same relief, shall be excluded, where such proceeding is prosecuted in good faith in a Court which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature, is unable to entertain it \u2013 The conditions for exclusion are that the earlier proceedings should have been for the same relief, the proceedings should have been prosecuted diligently and in good faith and the proceedings should have been prosecuted in a forum which, from defect of jurisdiction or other cause of a like nature, was unable to entertain it \u2013 Where such proceedings have ended, the outer limit to claim exclusion under s.14 would be the date on which the proceedings ended. Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 \u2013 Applicability to an application under s.7 of the IBC \u2013 Held: Legislature has in its wisdom chosen not to make the provisions of the Limitation Act verbatim applicable to proceedings in NCLT/NCLAT, but consciously used the words \u2018as far as may be\u2019 \u2013 The words \u2018as far as may be\u2019 are not meant to be otiose \u2013 Those words are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject matter of the legislation and the object which the Legislature has in view \u2013 The Courts would not give an interpretation to those words which would frustrate the purposes of making the Limitation Act applicable to proceedings in the NCLT/NCLAT \u2018as far as may be\u2019 \u2013 In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings under the IBC in the NCLT/NCLAT \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013s.238A \u2013 Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016: s.238A \u2013 Words \u2018as far as may be\u2019 \u2013 meaning of \u2013 Held: The use of words \u2018as far as may be\u2019, occurring in s.238A of the IBC tones down the rigour of the words \u2018shall\u2019 in the said Section which is normally considered as mandatory \u2013 The expression \u2018as far as may be\u2019 is indicative of the fact that all or any of the provisions of the Limitation Act may not apply to proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT) or the Appellate authority (NCLAT) if they are patently inconsistent with some provisions of the IBC \u2013 At the same time, the words \u2018as far as may be\u2019 cannot be construed as a total exclusion of the requirements of the basic principles of s.14 of the Limitation Act, but permits a wider, more liberal, contextual and purposive interpretation by necessary modification, which is in harmony with the principles of the said Section.Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002: s.13(4) \u2013 The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the Judicial Magistrate, as the case may be, exercising powers under s.14 of the SARFAESI Act, functions as a Civil Court/Executing Court \u2013 Proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would, therefore, be deemed to be civil proceedings in a Court \u2013 Moreover, proceedings under the SARFAESI Act under s.13(4) are appealable to the DRT under s.18 of the SARFAESI Act \u2013 Argument that proceedings under the SARFAESI Act would not qualify for exclusion under s.14 of the Limitation Act, because those proceedings were not conducted in a Civil Court, cannot be sustained. B Limitation Act, 1963: s.14 \u2013 Keeping in mind the scope and ambit of proceedings under the IBC before the NCLT/NCLAT, the expression \u2018Court\u2019 in s.14(2) would be deemed to be any forum for a civil proceeding including any Tribunal or any forum under the SARFAESI Act \u2013 Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Limitation Act, 1963: s.5 and s.14 \u2013 s.5 and s.14 of the Limitation Act are not mutually exclusive \u2013 Even in a case where s.14 does not strictly apply, the principles of s.14 can be invoked to grant relief to an applicant under s.5 of the Limitation Act by purposively construing \u2018sufficient cause\u2019 \u2013 It is well settled that omission to refer to the correct section of a statute does not vitiate an order \u2013 Delay can be condoned irrespective of whether there is any formal application, if there are sufficient materials on record disclosing sufficient cause for the delay \u2013 NCLAT rightly refused to stay the proceedings before the NCLT \u2013 The judgment and order of the NCLT does not warrant interference."

(b) In modification of paragraph 7 of the affidavit, those employees who were engaged in the year 2011 be given the benefit of 10 marks in the ensuing selection process while for every additional year that a contract employee had put in, benefit of one more mark subject to the ceiling of 8 additional marks be given; (c) The Public Notice inviting applications from the candidates shall specifically state that the advantage in terms of the order passed by this Court would be conferred upon the contract employees so that other candidates are put to adequate notice; (d) All the contract employees shall be entitled to offer their candidature for the ensuing selection in next four weeks and in order to give them sufficient time to prepare, the test shall be undertaken only after three months of the receipt of applications from the candidates \u2013 Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the affidavit with the modifications as directed will subserve the purpose \u2013 Such directions will not only afford chance to the contract employees to participate in the selection process regardless of their age but will also entitle them to some advantage over the other participants."

        "HeadNote": "Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) \u2013 \u2018sale in the course of import\u2019 \u2013 Essential features \u2013 The basic principles for determining as to when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of import or export are contained in s.5 of the CST Act \u2013 Under sub- section (2), a sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed to take place in the course of the import of the goods into the territory of India only if the sale or purchase either occasions such import or is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods before the goods have crossed the customs frontiers of India \u2013 The phrase \u2018sale in the course of import\u2019 carries three essential features - (i) that there must be a sale; (ii) that goods must actually be imported into the territory of India; and (iii) that the sale must be part and parcel of the import \u2013 A sale would become part and parcel of import if it either occasions such import or if it occurs by way of a transfer of document of title to the goods before the goods cross the customs frontiers of India. Customs Act, 1962: s.2(26) \u2013 Importer, who is \u2013 Sale on High Seas \u2013 Appellant\u2019s case was that there was a quadripartite agreement whereby the supplier sold the goods in question to the first-buyer and delivered them at the port of shipment \u2013 Thereafter, while the goods were on high seas, first buyer transferred them to the appellant by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the appellant \u2013 Further to this and while the goods were yet on high seas, appellant allegedly transferred them to the end-buyer by endorsing the bill of lading in favour of the end-buyer \u2013 Appellant also suggested that since the end-buyer did not have \u2018the requisite infrastructure\u2019 to undertake importation of goods whereas the appellant had the requisite infrastructure for importation, therefore, appellant was to act as an agent of the end-buyer and to clear the goods from customs authorities \u2013 Held: The inclusive definition of \u201cimporter\u201d in s.2(26)of the Customs Act cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry; and the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed, does not cease to be an importer \u2013 In this case, the name of the appellant was reflected as importer in the Import General Manifest (IGM) of the vessel/s that brought the goods in question to the port at Visakhapatnam \u2013 High Court observed that if the alleged second high seas sale had taken place, the IGM would have reflected the name of the last high seas sale purchaser as the importer and if there was any bonafide omission, the IGM would have necessitated amendment because only the last purchaser of the goods on high seas could have been the importer/consignee \u2013 It is but apparent that that while bringing anything into India from a place outside India is generally regarded as \u201cimport\u201d but, when the goods are cleared for home consumption, they are no longer imported goods for the purpose of the Customs Act \u2013 Significantly, in the process of importation, the importer, in relation to any goods, includes any owner or any other person holding himself to be the importer but, only between the time of their importation and their clearance for home consumption \u2013 In other words, the net result of the expanded definition of the expression \u201cimporter\u201d is that while any person who imports goods into India would be an importer but, the owner of the goods or a person holding himself to be an importer would also be regarded as an importer during the period between importation of goods and their clearance for home consumption \u2013 This crucial period would generally be that period when the goods have been warehoused after importation and are cleared from warehouse by a person other than the person who actually imported the goods \u2013 That being the position, High Court rightly held that this definition of importer cannot be used to usurp the identity of an importer from the person who filed the bill of entry \u2013 In other words, the person in whose name the bill of entry is filed does not cease to be an importer and, if that person claims to be not the owner or importer, the onus would be heavy on him to establish that someone else is the owner or importer of goods \u2013 Further, if the appellant was merely acting as an agent, then bill of entry would have reflected the name of end-buyer as the importer and the appellant as an agent of the importer; and further to that, the said end-buyer would have been assessed for customs duty \u2013 It was not so \u2013 Thus, when all official documents as also dealings of the appellant clearly establish that the appellant had been the importer, the consequences are bound to follow \u2013 It gets perforce reiterated that when the bills of entry recorded the name of the appellant as importer and the appellant alone was assessed to customs duty, the so called second high seas sale agreements never came into operation \u2013 Central Sales Tax Act, 1956 \u2013 s.5(2). Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) \u2013 Claim for exemption under \u2013 Raising of debit notes by the appellant on the end-buyers \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Inter State Sales \u2013 Appellant had admittedly raised debit notes on the end-buyers but only after having cleared the goods by filing the bill of entry for home consumption \u2013 Once the suggestion about the second high seas sales is not accepted and it is found that the appellant had been the importer of goods and had cleared them for home consumption, the natural consequence of raising of such debit notes on the end-buyers situated in different States and movement of goods to such end-buyers would be to take these transactions in the category of inter-State sales in terms of s.3(a) of the CST Act \u2013 Appellant was not entitled to the exemption of s.5(2) of the CST Act and rightly been held liable for tax over inter-State sales \u2013 After the appellant got the goods released by filing bill of entry for home consumption, indisputably, the goods were ultimately received by various end-buyers in different States and appellant raised debit notes from the State of Andhra Pradesh \u2013 These facts were sufficient to establish that the movement of goods inside the country from one State to another had been on account of the sale by appellant to the end-buyers; and such sales took place only after the appellant obtained the goods from the bonded warehouse for home consumption \u2013 High Court was right in observing that once the appellant got released the goods after filing the bill of entry for home consumption, the import stream dried up and the goods got mixed in the local goods \u2013 Any movement of the goods thereafter was bound to be a sale under s.3(a) of the CST Act; and such movement being from the State of Andhra Pradesh to other State, it had been a matter of inter-State sale \u2013 The principle that actual sale may not necessarily precede the movement of goods, in its true effect, operates rather against the appellant in relation to the sale to end-buyers after the goods were cleared for home consumption \u2013 The claimed exemption under s.5(2) of the CST Act was rightly denied to the appellant and the High Court was justified in dismissing the writ petitions filed by the appellant \u2013 No case for interference is made out. Central Sales Tax Act, 1956: s.5(2) \u2013 Whether any case for relegating the appellant to the remedy of appeal made out \u2013 Appellant, despite being aware of the availability of remedy of statutory appeal, consciously chose to file writ petitions against the assessment orders and consciously contested the entire matter in the High Court \u2013 High Court, even after noticing the framework of certiorari jurisdiction, examined the merits of the case thoroughly and even examined the submission made for the first time in writ petitions that the import of goods was occasioned by the sales in question \u2013 Of course, in that regard, the High Court pointed out that it was not a pure question of law but in any case, such submission was belied by the fact that the name of the appellant was reflected in the bill of entry as the importer and not that of the end-buyer \u2013 There is no error or fault in the approach of High Court in this case \u2013 After having consciously invoked the writ jurisdiction of the High Court and having contested the matter on merits, the appellant cannot now be allowed to re-open the matter in appeal \u2013 The extraordinary writ jurisdiction cannot be utilised by a litigant only to take chance and then to seek recourse to the other remedy after failing in its attempt on the basic merits of the case before the High Court \u2013 A litigation cannot be allowed to be unendingly kept alive at the choice of a litigant \u2013 Writ jurisdiction."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Whether once a resolution plan is accepted, the corporate debtor is discharged of liability; and as a consequence, the guarantor whose liability is co-extensive with the principal debtor, i.e. the corporate debtor, too is discharged of all liabilities \u2013 Held: Approval of a resolution plan relating to a corporate debtor does not ipso facto discharge a personal guarantor (of the corporate debtor) of his liabilities under the contract of guarantee \u2013 The release or discharge of a principal borrower from the debt owed by it to its creditor, by an involuntary process, i.e. by operation of law, or due to liquidation or insolvency proceeding, does not absolve the surety/guarantor of his or her liability, which arises out of an independent contract.
