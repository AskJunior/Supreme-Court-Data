XXI of the 1966 Rules was contrary to the law laiddown by the Constitution Bench inSita Ram v State of Uttar Pradeshreported as [1979] 2 SCR 1085\u2013 Held: The primary reason fordeleting the provisions of r.15(1)(c) of Or.XXI was that the sub-rule, as it was framed, envisaged that certain categories of appealswould be put up for hearing ex parte when it was open to the Courtto either dismiss summarily or, as the case may be, direct the issuanceof notice \u2013 In view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in SitaRam case that the issuance of a notice must follow, the Full Courtdecided to delete r.15(1)(c) of Or.XXI \u2013 The 1966 Rules have sincegiven way to the 2013 Rules \u2013Or.XX thereof contains provisions withrespect to the procedure for preliminary hearing of certain categoriesof criminal appeals before Supreme Court \u2013 r.5(1) of Or. XX indicatesthe categories of appeals which, on being registered, shall be putup for hearing ex parte but does not cover appeals falling u/Article134(1)(a) or (b) or s.2 of the Enlargement of Jurisdiction Act \u2013Hence, and even otherwise as a matter of precept, the principleslaid down by the Constitution Bench in Sita Ram case must governthe procedure to be followed while disposing of appeals u/Article134(1)(a) or (b) or s.2 of the Enlargement of Jurisdiction Act \u2013Ordinarily in all such appeals, notice must be issued \u2013 Whiledisposing of the appeal, it is only appropriate and proper that theCourt must record reasons\u2013 The object and intendment of thedeletion of r.15(1)(c) of Or. XXI of the 1966 Rules was to ensurethat such appeals are not disposed of summarily ex parte withoutthe issuance of a notice \u2013 The deletion must be so construed as togive effect to the fundamental postulate underlying the judgment ofthe Constitution Bench in Sita Ram case\u2013Further, the deletion of aprovision in the 2013 Rules akin to r.15(1)(c) of Or.XXI of the 1966Rules should not be interpreted to confer an uncharted discretionto dismiss an appeal of that description summarily at an ex partehearing without the issuance of a notice \u2013 Principles propoundedin Sita Ram continue to hold effect and guide preliminary hearingof certain categories of criminal appeals u/Or.XX, including Or.XX,r.21 of the 2013 Rules \u2013 In the present case, the appealfiled by thepetitioner u/s.2(a) of the Enlargement of Jurisdiction Act r/w s.379,CrPC was listed before Supreme Court for a preliminary hearingand was dismissed in limine\u2013 The judgment dismissing the appealdoes not evidently furnish reasons \u2013 The difficulty in granting anyrelief to the petitioner in these proceedings is that an appeal havingbeen dismissed on the judicial side and a review having been sincedismissed against that judgment, it would not be open for this Courtwhile exercising jurisdiction u/Article 32 of the Constitution to issueany contrary direction \u2013 Petitioner at liberty to pursue the remediesavailable in law \u2013 Principles of Natural Justice \u2013 Constitution ofIndia \u2013 Article 21."
