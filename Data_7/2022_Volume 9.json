Kerala Electricity Supply Code, 2014: Regn.153(15) \u2013 Whether Regn.153(15) is ultra vires of s.126 of Electricity Act, 2003 \u2013 Held: A rule making body must function within the purview of the rule making authority conferred on it by the parent Act \u2013 The body making rules or regulations has no inherent power of its own to make rules, but derives such power only from the statute, it has to necessarily function within the purview of the statute \u2013 If Regn.153(15) is to be given effect, then the same would frustrate the very object of s.126 of the Act \u2013 Therefore, Regn.153(15) is invalid on the ground that same is inconsistent with the provisions of s.126 of the Electricity Act, 2003 \u2013 Doctrine of ultra vires."

Constitution of India \u2013 Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 \u2013 Articles 246 A and 279A \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 ss.2(30), 2(93), 8 \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 ss.2(11), 5(3), 13(9) \u2013 Impugned notifications (Notification 8/2017 and 10/2017) issued by Central Government on the advice of the GST Council levied an integrated tax at the rate of 5 per cent on the supply of specified services, including transportation of goods, in a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and categorized the recipient of services of supply of goods by a person in a nontaxable territory by a vessel to include an importer u/s. 2(26) of the Customs Act, 1962 \u2013 Respondents-importers of non coking coal on a Cost-Insurance-Freight (CIF) basis, filed writ petition challenging the notifications \u2013 High Court held that the impugned notifications are unconstitutional for exceeding the powers conferred by the IGST Act and the CGST Act \u2013 On appeal, held: Government in exercise of its power u/s.5(3) of the IGST Act issued the impugned Notification 10/2017 specifying the \u2018categories of the supply\u2019 which shall be subject to reverse charge \u2013 The notification, besides specifying the criteria also mentioned the corresponding recipient in those categories \u2013 The IGST Act and the CGST Act define reverse charge and prescribe the entity that is to be taxed for these purposes \u2013 The specification of the recipient- in this case the importer- by Notification 10/2017 is only clarificatory \u2013 The Government by notification did not specify a taxable entity different from that which is prescribed in s.5(3) of the IGST Act for the purposes of reverse charge \u2013 The impugned notification 10/2017 clearly specifies a taxable person who is liable to pay a reverse charge that is envisaged in the statute \u2013 Thus, the impugned notifications cannot be invalidated for an alleged failure to identify a taxable person \u2013 Further, the impugned notification 8/2017 cannot be struck down for excessive delegation when it prescribes 10 per cent of the CIF value as the mechanism for imposing tax on a reverse charge basis \u2013 Also, Constitution Bench decision in GVK Industries recognises the power of Parliament to legislate over events occurring extra-territorially \u2013 The only requirement imposed is that such an event must have a real connection to India \u2013 In the present case, the impugned levy on the supply of transportation service by the shipping line to the foreign exporter to import goods into India has a two-fold connection: first, the destination of the goods is India and thus, a clear territorial nexus is established with the event occurring outside the territory; and second, the services are rendered for the benefit of the Indian importer \u2013 Thus, the transaction does have a nexus with the territory of India \u2013 On a conjoint reading of ss.2(11) and 13(9) of the IGST Act, r/w ss.2(93) of the CGST Act, the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an \u201cinter-state\u201d supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service \u2013 s.5(4) of the IGST Act enables the Central Government to specify a class of registered persons as the recipients, thereby conferring the power of creating a deeming fiction on the delegated legislation \u2013 Validity of the impugned notifications upheld u/ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act \u2013 However, the impugned levy imposed on the \u2018service\u2019 aspect of the transaction is in violation of the principle of \u2018composite supply\u2019 enshrined u/s.2(30) r/w s.8, CGST Act and the overall scheme of the GST legislation \u2013 Double taxation \u2013 Customs Act 1962 \u2013 s.2(26). Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 Statutory provisions and Scheme of the Act \u2013 Discussed. Constitution of India \u2013 Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 \u2013 Legislative History \u2013 Discussed. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 ss.2(11), 13(9) \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 s.2(93) \u2013 Whether the import of goods by a CIF contract constitutes an \u201cinter-state\u201d supply which can be subject to IGST where the importer of such goods would be the recipient of shipping service \u2013 Held: Yes. Constitution of India \u2013 Power of Parliament to levy tax over events occurring extra-territorially \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 s.2(93) \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 ss.5(3), 5(4) \u2013 Plea of respondents that the amended and unamended s.5(4) do not save the impugned notifications since they still make the reference to the term \u201crecipient\u201d \u2013 Held: s.5(4) employs the language \u201cas the recipient\u201d, in contradistinction to s.5(3) of the IGST Act which uses \u201cby the recipient\u201d \u2013 Recipient includes the importer \u2013 Further, s.5(4) clarifies that it may designate a class of registered persons as the recipient, thereby broadening the scope of s.2(93) of the CGST Act which is anyway an inclusive definition since s.2 is prefaced with \u201cunless the context otherwise requires\u201d \u2013 It is settled law that nonreference of the source of power may not vitiate its exercise and application in given facts and circumstances of a case. Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 s.5(3), 13(9) \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017\u2013 s.2(93)(c) \u2013 Whether the imports of goods on a CIF basis would also constitute import of shipping services, by way of deeming fiction \u2013 Held: s.5(3) of the IGST Act does not confer the powers on the Central Government to create a deeming fiction vis-\u00e0-vis who constitutes the recipient \u2013 It merely enables the Central Government to identify certain categories of goods and services, where the recipient of such services is subject to a reverse charge, as opposed to the usual mode of taxation where the supplier of the service is charged on a forward charge basis \u2013 However, s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act inherently create a deeming fiction of the importer of goods to be the recipient of shipping service. Constitution of India \u2013 \u201cRecommendations\u201d\u2013 Articles 3, 109, 111, 113, 117, 203, 207, 255 and 274; Article 233; Articles 243I, 243Y, 280, 281, 338, 338B and 340; Article 263; Articles 270, 275, 344, 349 and 371A \u2013 Nature and contextual meaning of \u2013 Discussed. Constitution of India \u2013 Constitutional role and functions of the GST Council, in the context of the simultaneous legislative power conferred on Parliament and the State legislatures \u2013 Discussed. Constitution of India \u2013 Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 \u2013 Articles 246A, 279A \u2013 Held: GST Council is not only an avenue for the exercise of cooperative federalism but also for political contestation across party lines \u2013 Thus, the discussions in the GST Council impact both federalism and democracy \u2013 The constitutional design of the Constitution Amendment Act 2016 is sui generis since it introduces unique features of federalism \u2013 Article 246A treats the Centre and States as equal units by conferring a simultaneous power of enacting law on GST \u2013 Article 279A in constituting the GST Council envisions that neither the Centre nor the States can act independent of the other. Constitution of India \u2013 GST Law \u2013 Essential legislative functions \u2013 Excessive delegation of, if any \u2013 Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 Whether the impugned notifications are ultra vires the IGST Act on the grounds of excessive delegation \u2013 Held: Legislature is required to perform its essential legislative functions \u2013 Once the skeletal structure of the policy is framed by the legislature, the details can emerge through delegated legislations \u2013 Legislature cannot delegate its \u2018essential legislative functions \u2013 Essential legislative functions with respect to the GST law are the levy of tax, subject matter of tax, taxable person, rate of taxation and value for the purpose of taxation \u2013 Principles governing these essential aspects of taxation find place in the IGST Act \u2013 Both the IGST and CGST Act clearly define reverse charge, recipient and taxable persons \u2013 Thus, the essential legislative functions vis-\u00e0-vis reverse charge have not been delegated. Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 ss. 2(30) and 8 \u2013 Impugned levy seeking to impose IGST on the \u2018service\u2019 aspect of the transaction, if in violation of the principle of \u2018composite supply\u2019 incorporated u/ s.2(30) r/w s.8 of the CGST Act \u2013 Held: Yes \u2013 Since the Indian importer is liable to pay IGST on the \u2018composite supply\u2019, comprising of supply of goods and supply of services of transportation, insurance, etc. in a CIF contract, a separate levy on the Indian importer for the \u2018supply of services\u2019 by the shipping line would be in violation of s.8 of the CGST Act \u2013 Double taxation. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 s.2(93)(c) \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 s.13(9) \u2013 Held: The only argument that supports the case of the appellant is that of s.13(9) of the IGST Act r/w s.2(93)(c) of the CGST Act which defines a \u201crecipient\u201d \u2013 s.13(9) of the IGST Act creates the deeming fiction of place of supply of service to be the destination of goods when they are transported by means other than mail or courier \u2013 No specific exemptions for importers have been carved out \u2013 This reasoning is accepted and read into the definition of recipient in s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Central Goods and Services Tax, Act 2017 \u2013 s.24(iii) \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 ss.5(3), (4) \u2013 Held: Power of the Central Government to designate persons and categories of supply for reverse charge derives from ss.5(3) and 5(4) of the IGST Act and not s.24(iii) of the CGST Act which mandates the compulsorily registration as a logical corollary to ensure tax collection. Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 s.2(93) \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 s.5(3) \u2013 Held: Interpreting the term \u201cby the recipient\u201d vis-\u00e0-vis the categories of goods and services identified in s.5(3) of the IGST Act should necessarily be governed by the principles governing the definition of \u201crecipient\u201d u/s.2(93) of the CGST Act. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Legislative history, Parliamentary debates, Committee Reports \u2013 Held: Though the traditional view of interpretation of statutes is that legislative history is not readily used in interpreting a law, the modern trend of thinking on the subject has enabled courts to look into the history of a legislation to understand the full purport of the words used and the mischief sought to be remedied by the law \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Articles 246A, 279A \u2013 Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment Act) 2016 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. Words and Phrases: \u201cRecommendations\u201d\u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Interpretation of, vis-\u00e0-vis the provisions of IGST Act and CGST Act \u2013 Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017. \u2018Cooperative federalism\u2019; \u2018Dual federalism\u2019; \u2018Fiscal federalism\u2019 \u2013 Discussed"

Criminal Trial \u2013 Death Sentence \u2013 When to be awarded \u2013 Discussed \u2013 A two-step process has to be followed to determine whether a case deserves death sentence \u2013 Firstly, that the case belongs to the \u2018rarest of rare\u2019 category, and secondly, that the option of life imprisonment would simply not suffice \u2013 For the first step, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances would have to be identified and considered equally \u2013 For the second, the court has to consider whether the alternative of life imprisonment was unquestionable foreclosed as the sentencing aim of reformation was unachievable, for which the State must provide material.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Test Identification Parade \u2013 TIPs are meant to test witness veracity and their capability to identify unknown persons \u2013 TIPs should be conducted at the earliest possible time to eliminate the chance of accused being shown to witnesses before the identification parade, which might otherwise affect such witnesses\u2019 memory \u2013 No provision of law enables an accused to claim TIP as a matter of right \u2013 Delay or failure in holding TIP ipso facto does not render the evidence inadmissible or unacceptable, however it affects the credibility and weight attached to such identification. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 Circumstantial Evidence \u2013 Principles applicable to appreciation of evidence \u2013 The correct approach of courts trying criminal cases involving circumstantial evidence should be that the circumstances alleged, be fully established \u2013 All the facts so established should be consistent only with hypothesis of the guilt of the accused \u2013 Circumstances should be conclusive and of such tendency that they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. Criminal Trial \u2013 Practice and Procedures \u2013 Omission of prosecution witness to state a fact \u2013 Effect of: The omission of some of the prosecution witnesses to mention a particular fact, or corroborate something, which is deposed to by other witnesses does not ipso facto favour an accused \u2013 However, more important is whether the omission to depose about a fact is so fundamental that the prosecution version becomes shaky and incredulous. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 24 \u2013 Role of Public Prosecutor in Criminal Trial \u2013 Public prosecutor occupies a statutory office of high regard \u2013 They are not part of the investigating agency, rather an independent statutory authority who serve as officers to the court \u2013 The role of the public prosecutor is intrinsically dedicated to conducting a fair trial and not for a \u2018thirst to reach the case in conviction\u2019. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss.172, 173 \u2013 Maintenance of case diary mandatory \u2013 Police have the power to investigate freely and fairly, in the course of which, it is mandatory to maintain a diary where the day-to-day proceedings are to be recorded with specific mention of time of events, places visited, departure and reporting back, statements recorded, etc \u2013 Criminal Court is empowered to summon these diaries u/s 172(2) for purpose of inquiry or trial, s. 173(3) makes it clear that the accused cannot claim any right to peruse them, unless the police themselves, rely on it to refresh their memory or if the court uses it for contradicting the testimony of the police officers. Criminal Trial \u2013 Fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence founded on Arts. 20 and 21 of the Constitution require not just the investigating agency but also courts in their own independent field, to ensure that investigation is fair and does not hamper the individual\u2019s freedom, except in accordance with law, i.e., ensure adherence to the rule of law. Criminal Trial \u2013 Practical guidelines to collect mitigating circumstances \u2013 Trial Court must elicit information from the accused and the State both \u2013 The State must for an offence carrying capital punishment - at the appropriate stage, produce material which is preferably collected beforehand, before the Sessions Court disclosing psychiatric and psychological evaluation of the accused \u2013 This will help establish proximity to the accused person\u2019s frame of mind \u2013 The State must in a time-bound manner collect additional information pertaining to the accused \u2013Information regarding the accused\u2019s jail conduct and behaviour, activities the accused involved themselves in, and other related details should be called for in the form of a report from the relevant jail authorities. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Sentencing \u2013 An effective sentencing hearing to the accused at the relevant stage is a right under s.235(2)."

FIR: Delay in forwarding FIR to jurisdictional Court \u2013 Effect on prosecution case \u2013 Held: While every delay in forwarding the FIR may not necessarily be fatal to the case of the prosecution, Courts may be duty bound to see the effect of such delay on the investigation and even the creditworthiness of the investigation \u2013 The word \u201cforthwith\u2019 in s.157(1) of the Code is to be understood in the context of the given facts and circumstances of each case and a straight-jacket formula cannot be applied in all cases \u2013 But where ocular evidence is found to be unreliable and thus unacceptable, a long delay has to be taken note of by the Court \u2013 Delay of five days in transmitting the FIR to the jurisdictional court, especially in the facts and circumstances of the present case was fatal \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.157(1). Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.53A \u2013 Relevance of medical examination of rape accused in cases based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 In cases where the victim of rape is alive and is in a position to testify in court, it may be possible for the prosecution to take a chance by not medically examining the accused \u2013 But in cases where the victim is dead and the offence is sought to be established only by circumstantial evidence, medical evidence assumes great importance \u2013 Failure of prosecution to produce such evidence, despite there being no obstacle from the accused or anyone, will certainly create a gaping hole in the case of the prosecution and give rise to a serious doubt on the case of the prosecution \u2013 s.53A enables the prosecution to obtain a significant piece of evidence to prove the charge \u2013 Failure of the prosecution in the instant case to subject the appellant to medical examination is certainly fatal to the prosecution case especially when the ocular evidence is found to be not trustworthy.

        "HeadNote": "Armed Forces: One Rank One Pension-OROP \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Writ petition challenging the manner in which the OROP policy for ex-servicemen of defence forces has been implemented by the Union of India through a letter dated 07.11.2015 issued to the Chiefs of three defence forces \u2013 Letter defining OROP as the payment of uniform pension to armed services personnel retiring in the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement; that OROP aims to bridge the gap between the rate of pension of current and past pensioners at periodic intervals \u2013 Petitioners case that in the course of implementation, the principle of OROP has been replaced by \u2018one rank multiple pensions\u2019 for persons with the same length of service; that the initial definition of OROP was altered by the UOI and, instead of an automatic revision of the rates of pension, where any future enhancement to the rates of pension are automatically passed on to the past pensioners, the revision now would take place at periodic intervals, is arbitrary and unconstitutional \u2013 Held: There is no constitutional infirmity in the OROP principle as defined by the communication dated 07.11.2015 \u2013 Definition of OROP is uniformly applicable to all the pensioners irrespective of the date of retirement \u2013 Cut-off date is used only for the purpose of determining the base salary for the calculation of pension \u2013 While for those who retired after 2014, the last drawn salary is used to calculate pension, for those who retired prior to 2013, the average salary drawn in 2013 is used \u2013 Since the uniform application of the last drawn salary for the purpose of calculating pension would put the prior retirees at a disadvantage, the Union Government has taken a policy decision to enhance the base salary for the calculation of pension \u2013 Such a decision lies within the ambit of policy choices \u2013 There was no conscious policy decision on the part of the Union Government on the modalities for implementing OROP until the communication dated 07.11.2015 came into being, and thus, the communication of 07.11.2015 cannot be invalidated on the ground that it infringed the \u2018original understanding\u2019 of OROP \u2013 Expression \u2018automatically passed on\u2019 cannot be construed as a commitment with reference to any period of time for the computation of benefits \u2013 Decision of the Central Government to revise the pension every five years cannot be held to violate the precepts underlying Art. 14 \u2013 Policy decision \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14, 32 \u2013 Service law. Pension \u2013 One Rank One Pension-OROP \u2013 Legitimate Expectation \u2013 Invocation of \u2013 Held: Doctrine of legitimate expectations can be invoked if a representation made by a public body leads an individual to believe that they would be a recipient of a substantive benefit \u2013 Doctrine of legitimate expectations emerges as a facet of Art. 14 \u2013 However, in the present case, there was no concrete government policy in existence prior to 07.11.2015 \u2013 There existed only certain assurances \u2013 These assurances were also to the effect that OROP has been accepted in principle - Implementation was yet to be worked out. Pension \u2013 One Rank One Pension \u2013 Concept and genesis of \u2013 Policy and Principles \u2013 Discussed. Administrative Law: Policy Decisions \u2013 Scope of judicial review \u2013 Held: Adjudication cannot serve as a substitute for policy \u2013 Most questions of policy involve complex considerations of not only technical and economic factors but also require balancing competing interests for which democratic reconciliation rather than adjudication is the best remedy \u2013 An increased reliance on judges to solve matters of pure policy diminishes the role of other political organs in resolving contested issues of social and political policy, which require a democratic dialogue \u2013 It is not that this Court will shy away from setting aside policies that impinge on constitutional rights \u2013 Rather it is to provide a clear-eyed role of the function that a court serves in a democracy \u2013 One Rank One Pension-OROP is itself a matter of policy and it was open to the makers of the policy to determine the terms of implementation \u2013 Policy is of course subject to judicial review on constitutional parameters, which is a distinct issue."

        "HeadNote": "Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 Depositories Act, 1996 \u2013 Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 1996 - Whether the Depositories Act, 1996 read with the Regulation 58 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulations, 19961 has the legal effect of overwriting the provisions relating to the contracts of pledge under the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the common law as applicable in India \u2013 Held: The Depositories Act prescribes how the dematerialised securities can be pledged \u2013 The provisions of the Depositories Act and the 1996 Regulations are not in derogation of the Contract Act but in addition to it \u2013 In this regard, reference is made to Section 28 of the Depositories Act \u2013 Therefore, the object of the Depositories Act is not to rewrite the provisions of the Contract Act but to regulate the creation and transfer of dematerialised securities \u2013 Regulation 38(1)(e) requires a depository to maintain, inter alia, records of all approvals, notices and entries, and cancellation of pledge or hypothecation, as the case may be. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 ss. 148-171, 172-179 \u2013 Bailment and Pledge \u2013 Legal Distinction \u2013 In the cases of bailment, the goods are bailed for specific purpose and once the purpose is accomplished the bailee is bound to deliver the possession of the goods back to the bailor or to dispose off the goods as per the bailor\u2019s direction \u2013 Unlike bailment, in pledge there is the delivery of possession of the goods by the pawnor to the pawnee by way of security upon the promise of repayment of a debt or the performance of a promise, thereby creating an estate that vests with the pawnee \u2013 Pledge is preceded by bailment Words and Phrases \u2013 \u201cPledge\u201d, \u201cMortgage\u201d \u2013 Movable Property \u2013 Legal Distinction \u2013 A mortgage conveys the whole legal interest in the chattel, while a pledge conveys only a special property leaving the general property in the pledger, and the pledgee never has absolute ownership of property \u2013 Further unlike pledgee, a mortgagee acquires general right in the things mortgaged subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor \u2013 Compared to the pledge, a pawnee has only special right in the goods pledged, namely the right of possession as security and in case of default, he can bring a suit against the pawnor as well as sell the goods after giving a reasonable notice. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 Accretion of the Pawned Goods \u2013 Duty of the the Pawnee towards such accretion \u2013 The pledge extends to accretions and additions, and therefore, when the pawnee returns the pledged goods, the accretions and additions must be returned to the pawnor \u2013 Further it also follows that the pawnee\u2019s right to retain and sell the pledged goods stretches to the right to retain and sell any increase and accumulations to the pledged goods. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 176, 177 \u2013 Pawnee\u2019s duty to give notice of intended sale of pawned goods \u2013 Extent - Section 176 of the Contract Act, unlike some of the sections of the Contract Act, does not specifically provide that the contractual terms can override the provision by using the expression \u201cin the absence of the contract to the contrary\u201d or \u201csubject to special contract to the contrary\u201d \u2013 The notice, that is to be given for the intended sale by the pawnee, is a special protection that the statute has given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot agree that the pawnee may sell the pledged goods without notice to the pledgor \u2013 Further, the mere tendering of notice to the pawnor does not binds pawnee to put the intended sale to the effect and he is not bound to sell even after tendering of such notice \u2013 If the notice is served, the pawnor may redeem the goods as per s. 177 before the \u2018actual sale\u2019 by the pawnee. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 63, 176 \u2013 Whether Parties to Pledge Agreement can waive the requirement of Notice As contemplated by s. 176 \u2013 Settled Legal position \u2013 S. 63 of the Contract Act governs the domain of waiver and it is a general principle of law that everyone has a right to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity however, such a waiver cannot infringe any public right or public policy \u2013 But the requirement of \u2018notice\u2019 u/s 176 is a mandatory requirement and a special protection given to the pawnor \u2013 S. 176 is not eclipsed or curtailed by the phrase \u201cin the absence of the contract to the contrary\u201d and therefore the parties cannot contract out of Section 176 \u2013 Further the need for notice to the pawnor of the intended sale by the pawnee is the special protection given to the pawnor, and the parties cannot override the special protection by agreement. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 Whether a Pawnee can Sell Goods Pledged to \u2018Himself\u2019 \u2013 Settled Legal Position \u2013 It is settled legal position that a pawnee cannot sell goods to himself, and if he does so then such transfer could not be said to be a \u2018sale\u2019 but a \u2018conversion\u2019 and hence could not interpreted as \u2018sale\u2019 in terms of s. 176. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Rules of Interpretation when two or more than two statutes apply \u2013 To resolve a debate when two views are evident, it is best to interpret the provision when we know why the statute is enacted \u2013 If a statute is looked at, in the context of its enactment, with the glasses of the statute-maker provided by such context, its scheme, the sections, clauses, phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context and this principle may equally apply when we examine interplay between two statutes \u2013 Two statutes shall be read together consistently and harmoniously to complement each other so far as it is reasonably possible to do so, and where such conciliation is not possible to clarify the legal position by application of principles of interpretation applicable to such situations. Depositories Act, 1996 \u2013 s.2(1)(a), 2(1)(j) \u2013 Words and Phrases \u2013 \u201cRegistered Owner\u2019\u2019, \u2018Beneficial Owner\u2019 - Legislative Intent and Purpose - The Depositories Act is enacted to lay down a process and rules for the dematerialization of securities by converting them into electronic data stored in the computers of \u2018the depository\u2019 and hence by the aforesaid enactment, the legislature sought to get away with physical security \u2013 Further the Depositories Act establishes the depository eco-system and introduces the concepts of a \u2018registered owner\u2019 and \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 \u2013 The depository\u2019 becomes the \u2018registered owner\u2019 in respect of the security, whereas the person who surrenders the physical shares is recorded as \u2018the beneficial owner\u2019 \u2013 Further the beneficial owner\u2019 shall be solely entitled to all rights, benefits, and liabilities attached to the securities held by \u2018the depository\u2019. And therefore Power and right to transfer ownership of a dematerialised security vests with the \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 same as in the case of buying and selling physical securities. Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s. 176, 177 \u2013 Depositories Act, 1996 \u2013 s.12 25, 28 \u2013 Securities and Exchange Board of India (Depositories and Participants) Regulation 1996 \u2013 Regulation 58 \u2013 Interplay of The Statutes - In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 12, a \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 can create a pledge or hypothecation regarding the security owned by him through \u2018the depository\u2019, subject to prior approval of \u2018the depository\u2019 but the aforesaid provision nowhere defines the term \u2018pledge\u2019 \u2013 Section 25 of the Depositories Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been vested with the power to make Regulations to carry out the purpose of the Depositories Act \u2013 As per s. 25(2)(d) the regulations may provide for the manner of creating a pledge or hypothecation in respect of a security owned by a \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 under sub-section (1) to Section 12 of the Depositories Act \u2013 Further as per Regulation 58 a beneficial owner may create a pledge on security owned by him and for this purpose, in cases of Pledge, the pawnee, to exercise the right under s. 12 r/ w Regulation 58, shall, by virtue of Regulation 58(8), get himself recorded as \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 before he proceeds to sell the pledged securities \u2013 The Acts and the Regulations are not inconsistent but are subject to harmonious construction in order to attain the objective sought to be achieved more so when s. 28 itself provides that \u201cthe provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time force relating to the holding and transfer of securities\u2019\u2019 \u2013 Further Sections 176 and 177 are not obliterated, in so far as they would equally apply to pawned dematerialised securities as they apply to other pawned goods \u2013 Further the requirement of pawnee to get himself registered as \u2018beneficial owner\u2019 in in terms of the Act and Regulation, is not an actual sale and would not affect the right of the pawnor of redemption u/s 177 of the Contract Act more so because the pawnee is not getting anything paid against the debt due."

Parade was conducted by the investigating officer during the course of investigation for the identification of the accused, nor any of the witnesses had identified the accused during their respective depositions before the Court \u2013 The circumstances under which the accused were arrested and the car was seized have also raised serious doubts in the story put-forth by the prosecution \u2013 None of the witnesses had seen the registration number of the car in which the victim was kidnapped \u2013 The trial Court had allowed the entire disclosure statements of the three accused to be admitted in evidence, the said statements being in nature of the confessions before the police were hit by s.25 of the Evidence Act \u2013 Trial Court had committed gross error in exhibiting the entire disclosure statements of the accused recorded \u2013 The incriminating articles were sent to the CFSL for examination however, no conclusive opinion was given by the CFSL to establish their link with the accused \u2013 The call details record of the phone being electronic record, was also not proved in terms of s.65B of the Evidence Act \u2013 It has been noticed from the record that out of the 49 witnesses examined by the prosecution, 10 material witnesses were not cross-examined and many other important witnesses were not adequately cross-examined by the defence counsel \u2013 The Appellants-accused were deprived of their rights to have a fair trial, apart from the fact that the truth also could not be elicited by the trial Court \u2013 Judgments and orders of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court and the High Court set aside. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 27, 45 & 65B \u2013 Circumstantial Evidence \u2013 The circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability, the crime was committed by the accused only and none else \u2013 The evidence with regard to the arrest of the appellants-accused, their identification, discoveries and recoveries of the incriminating articles, identity of the Indica Car, the seizures and sealing of the articles and collection of samples, the medical and scientific evidence, the report of DNA profiling, the evidence with regard to the CDRs etc. were not proved by the prosecution by leading, cogent, clinching and clear evidence much less unerringly pointing the guilt of the accused. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.165 \u2013 Section 165 of the Indian Evidence Act confers unbridled powers upon the trial courts to put any question at any stage to the witnesses to elicit the truth \u2013 The Judge is not expected to be a passive umpire but is supposed to actively participate in the trial, and to question the witnesses to reach to a correct conclusion."
