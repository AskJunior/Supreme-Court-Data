Chapter VII, Section 36 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 provides for grant of preventive relief. Section 37 provides that temporary injunction in a suit shall be regulated by the Code of Civil Procedure. The grant of relief in a suit for specific performance is itself a discretionary remedy. A plaintiff seeking temporary injunction in a suit for specific performance will therefore have to establish a strong prima-facie case on basis of undisputed facts. The conduct of the plaintiff will also be a very relevant consideration for purposes of injunction. The discretion at this stage has to be exercised judiciously and not arbitrarily. In a matter concerning grant of injunction, apart from the existence of a prima facie case, balance of convenience, irreparable injury,  "

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 227 \u2013 Contours of jurisdiction under \u2013 Held: The principle established is to take the materials produced by the prosecution, both in the form of oral statements and also documentary material, and act upon it without it been subjected to questioning through cross-examination and everything assumed in favour of the prosecution, if a scenario emerges where no offence, as alleged, is made out against the accused, it, undoubtedly, would enure to the benefit of the accused warranting the Trial Court to discharge the accused \u2013 It is not open to the accused to rely on material by way of defence and persuade the court to discharge him. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 227 \u2013 Discharge \u2013 Defence of accused seeking discharge \u2013 Held: The defence of the accused is not to be looked into at the stage when the accused seeks to be discharged u/s. 227 of the Cr.PC (State of J & K v. Sudershan Chakkar and another) \u2013 The expression, \u201cthe record of the case\u201d, used in Section 227 of the Cr.PC, is to be understood as the documents and the articles, if any, produced by the prosecution \u2013 The Code does not give any right to the accused to produce any document at the stage of framing of the charge \u2013 At the stage of framing of the charge, the submission of the accused is to be confined to the material produced by the Police (State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi). Dismissing the appeal, the Court"

Union of India (2019 SCC Online 441) held that the process leading up to the grant of an Environmental clearance on 28.10.2015 was flawed \u2013 Held: On reading of the process leading upto the instant proceedings, it cannot be said that EAC has, it its appraisal process, ignored the concerns which were highlighted by the Supreme Court \u2013 The EAC has adequately addressed four areas i.e. (i) Forests; (ii) Ecologically sensitive areas; (iii) Western Ghats and (iv) Flora & Fauna and has laid down additional conditions to ensure the adequate protection of the environment \u2013 A comprehensive process has been followed by the EAC bearing in mind the requirements of the Airport Guidance Manual \u2013 The process which has been adopted by the EAC and its ultimate conclusions must be scrutinized, in the course of judicial review, in the context of the limitations which were attached to the Court conducting a merits based review \u2013 Earlier, the Court did not quash the EC but suspended it until the EAC revisited its recommendations in the light of the concerns which were expressed by the Supreme Court \u2013 Having assessed the process which took place following the judgment of the Supreme Court and outcome, it would be difficult to hold that it fails to meet the standards which the Court applies in the course of judicial review in the environmental matters \u2013 The minutes of the meeting of the EAC dated 23.4.2019"

Union of India & Ors. (2016) 6 SCALE 417: (2016) 13 SCC 153: [2016] 3 SCR 407 in affirmation \u2013 However, it was contended that the Prohibition laid down by the majority in Indra Sawhney & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors. (1992) Supp. 3 SCC 125 applies not only to Article 16(4) but also Article 16(1) of the Constitution of India and inference to the contrary is not justified \u2013 Also, there was a Office Memorandum dated 29.12.2005 issued by the Government which stated that the quantum of reservation as \u201c2(ii) Three percent of the vacancies in case of promotion to Group D, and Group C posts in which the element of direct recruitment, if any, does not exceed 75%, shall be reserved for persons with disabilities...\u201d\u2013 The said O.M. was considered in the Union of India and Another v. National Federation of the Blind and others (2013) 10 SCC 772, it held that the computation of reservation for persons with disabilities has to be computed in case of Group A,B,C and D posts in identical manner, accordingly clauses of O.M. dated 29.12.2005 contrary to this reasoning are struck down \u2013 It was also held that the reservation for persons with disabilities has nothing to do with the ceiling of 50% and hence, Indra Sawhney is not applicable with respect to the disabled persons \u2013 The instant batch of cases were referred to the larger Bench for consideration \u2013 The larger Bench, held: In Rajeev Kumar Gupta & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors (2016) 13 SCC 153 it was held the rule of no reservation in promotions as laid down in Indra Sawhney has no application to persons with disabilities \u2013 This judgment cannot be faulted when it stated that Indra Sawhney dealt with a different problem and, therefore, cannot be followed \u2013 Consequently, the reference stands answered by stating that the judgment Union of India and Another v. National Federation of the Blind and others (2013) 10 SCC 772 as clarified in National Federation of the Blind v. Sanjay Kothari, Secretary Department of Personnel and Training, 2015 (9) Scale 611 and the judgment in Rajeev Kumar Gupta and others v. Union of India & Ors. (2016) 13 SCC 153 case will bind the Union and the State Governments and must be strictly followed notwithstanding the O.M. dated 29.12.2005, in particular. Union of India and Another v. National Federation of the Blind and Others, (2013) 10 SCC 772 : [2013] 9 SCR 1023; National Federation of the Blind v. Sanjay Kothari, Secy. Deptt. of Personnel and Training, 2015 (9) Scale 611; Rajeev Kumar Gupta & Others v. Union of India & Others (2016) 13 SCC 153 : [2016] 3 SCR 407 \u2013 held applicable. Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, (1992) Supp 3 SCC 217 : [1992] 2 Suppl. SCR 454 \u2013 held inapplicable."
