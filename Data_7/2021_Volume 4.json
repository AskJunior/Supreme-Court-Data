Permanent Commission \u2013 Claim of women \u2013 Medical criteria prescribed by the Army \u2013 Judicial review of \u2013 Held: Physical fitness is crucial for securing a place in the Army \u2013 While exercising judicial review, the Court must be circumspect on dealing with policies prescribed for the Armed Forces personnel on physical and mental fitness \u2013 There can be no judicial review of the medical standards adopted by the Army, unless they are manifestly arbitrary and bear no rational nexus to the objects of the organization \u2013 SHAPE criterion is per se not arbitrary \u2013 Constitution of India. Constitution of India : Art. 14 \u2013 Right to equality \u2013 Equal opportunity in public employment and gender equality \u2013 Held: Since independence there is continuous endeavor to achieve equal opportunity in public employment and gender equality \u2013 Structures of the society have been created by males and for males \u2013 Facially equal application of laws to unequal parties is a farce, when the law is structured to cater to a male standpoint \u2013 Thus, adjustments, both in thought and letter, necessary to rebuild the structures of an equal society \u2013 These adjustments and amendments are not concessions being granted to a set of persons, but are the wrongs being remedied to obliterate years of suppression of opportunities which should have been granted to women \u2013 It cannot be said that the women officers are allowed to serve the Armed Forces, when the true picture of their service conditions is totally different \u2013 Superficial sense of equality is not in the true spirit of the Constitution and attempts to make equality only symbolic. Gender justice: Antidiscrimination law \u2013 Concept of \u2013 Formal versus substantive equality \u2013 Held: Under the formal and symmetric conception of anti discrimination law, the law requires is that likes be treated alike \u2013 It is premised on the notion that fairness demands consistency in treatment \u2013 The fact that some protected groups are disproportionately and adversely impacted by the operation of the concerned law or its practice, makes no difference \u2013 On the other hand, under a substantive approach, the anti discrimination guarantee pursues more ambitious objectives \u2013 This conception eschews the uncritical adoption of laws and practices that appear neutral but in fact help to validate and perpetuate an unjust status quo \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14 and 15(1). Indirect discrimination \u2013 Doctrine of \u2013 Held: Is closely tied to the substantive conception of equality \u2013 Use of the term \u2018indirect discrimination\u2019 is not to refer to discrimination which is remote, but is as real as any other form of discrimination \u2013 Indirect discrimination is caused by facially neutral criteria by not taking into consideration the underlying effects of a provision, practice or a criterion \u2013 In evaluating direct and indirect discrimination, it is important to underscore that these tests, when applied in strict disjunction from one another, may end up producing narrow conceptions of equality which may not account for systemic flaws that embody discrimination \u2013 Doctrine seeks to broaden the scope of antidiscrimination law to equip the law to remedy patterns of discrimination that are not as easily discernible. Indirect and direct discrimination \u2013 Difference between \u2013 Held: As long as a court\u2019s focus is on the mental state underlying the impugned action that is allegedly discriminatory, it is the area of direct discrimination \u2013 However, when the focus switches to the effects of the concerned action, it is indirect discrimination \u2013 An enquiry as to indirect discrimination looks, not at the form of the impugned conduct, but at its consequences \u2013 In a case of direct discrimination, the judicial enquiry is confined to the act or conduct at issue, abstracted from the social setting or background fact- situation in which the act or conduct takes place \u2013 In indirect discrimination, on the other hand, the subject matter of the enquiry is the institutional or societal framework within which the impugned conduct occurs. Systemic Discrimination \u2013 Explanation of \u2013 Systemic discrimination as antithetical to substantive equality \u2013 Held: Emphasis on intent alone as the key to unlocking discrimination has resulted in several practices, under the veneer of objectivity and equal application to all persons, to fall through the cracks of our equality jurisprudence \u2013 Indirect discrimination as a tool of jurisprudential analysis, can result in the redressal of several inequities \u2013 In order to conceptualize substantive equality, it would be apposite to conduct a systemic analysis of discrimination that combines tools of direct and indirect discrimination \u2013 Particular discriminatory practice or provision might often be insufficient to expose the entire gamut of discrimination that a particular structure may perpetuate \u2013 Exclusive reliance on tools of direct or indirect discrimination may also not effectively account for multiple axles of discrimination \u2013 Therefore, a systemic view of discrimination, in perceiving discriminatory disadvantage as a continuum, would account for not just unjust action but also inaction \u2013 Duty of constitutional courts, when confronted with such a scheme, would not just be to strike down the discriminatory practices and compensate for the harm hitherto arising out of them; but also structure adequate reliefs and remedies that facilitate social re- distribution by providing for positive entitlements that aim to negate the scope of future harm \u2013 An analysis of discrimination, with a view towards its systemic manifestations (direct and indirect), would be best suited for achieving the constitutional vision of equality and antidiscrimination. Doctrine of indirect discrimination \u2013 Comparative study \u2013 Position in India, United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada \u2013 Discussed."

Arbitration \u2013 Arbitration agreement \u2013 Held: An arbitration agreement is a distinct and separate agreement, which is independent from the substantive commercial contract in which it is embedded \u2013 This is based on the premise that when parties enter into a commercial contract containing an arbitration clause, they are entering into two separate agreements viz. (i) the substantive contract which contains the rights and obligations of the parties arising from the commercial transaction; and, (ii) the arbitration agreement which contains the binding obligation of the parties to resolve their disputes through the mode of arbitration. Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Doctrine of separability of the arbitration agreement \u2013 Held: The doctrine of separability of the arbitration agreement connotes that the invalidity, ineffectiveness, or termination of the substantive commercial contract, would not affect the validity of the arbitration agreement, except if the arbitration agreement itself is directly impeached on the ground that the arbitration agreement is void ab initio. A Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Doctrine of kompetenz \u2013 Held: kompetenz implies that the arbitral tribunal has the competence to determine and rule on its own jurisdiction, including objections with respect to the existence, validity, and scope of the arbitration agreement, in the first instance, which is subject to judicial scrutiny by the courts at a later stage of the proceedings \u2013 Under the Arbitration Act, the challenge before the Court is maintainable only after the final award is passed as provided by sub-section (6) of s.16."

        "HeadNote": "Education/Educational Institutions: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) \u2013 Examination Byelaws of the Board, if having the force of law \u2013 Held: The CBSE Examination Byelaws are couched in the form of a code \u2013 They provide for all essential aspects relating to formal education of a student including admission, examination, migration, transfer, curriculum, fee for various services, issuance of verified certificates, modifications in certificates etc. \u2013 The Byelaws, therefore, bind the parties and are duly enforceable in a court of law, even by way of writ remedies \u2013 The Byelaws of the Board have the force of law and must be regarded as such for all legal purposes \u2013 It would serve no meaningful purpose to hold these authoritative set of rules originating from an instrumentality of the State as mere contractual terms despite there being overwhelming public interest in their just application \u2013 Arguendo, the Examination Byelaws are not \u201claw\u201d under Art.13, it would not affect the power of the Court to scrutinize them in reference to Part-III of the Constitution of India as CBSE is \u201cState\u201d within the meaning of Art.12 and all its actions are consequently subject to Part-III \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Part III \u2013 Arts. 12 and 13 \u2013 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Examination Byelaws of 2007. Education/Educational Institutions: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) \u2013 Correction/change in certificates issued by the Board \u2013 Scope of permissible corrections/ changes \u2013 The CBSE Examination Byelaws restrict, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the corrections/changes that can be carried out in the certificates issued by the Board \u2013 Test of rationality \u2013 Whether Examination Byelaws of CBSE / Board impose reasonable restrictions \u2013 Held: The identity of an individual is one of the most closely guarded areas of the constitutional scheme in India \u2013 Name can be regarded as one of the foremost indicators of identity \u2013 Going by the very nature of rights under Article 19, the right to get changed name recorded in the official (public) records cannot be an absolute right and as a matter of public policy and larger public interest calls for certain reasonable restrictions to observe consistency and obviate confusion and deceptive attempt \u2013 On facts, the Byelaws permit change of name only if permission from the Court has been obtained prior to the publication of result \u2013 The provision is problematic on certain counts \u2013 There can be numerous circumstances wherein change of name could be a legitimate requirement and keeping the ultimate goal of preserving the standard of education in mind, the Board must provide for a reasonable opportunity to effect such changes \u2013 Balance of convenience would tilt in favour of students for, they stand to lose more due to inaccuracies in their certificates than the Board whose sole worry is increasing administrative burden \u2013 CBSE maintains its official records in respect of candidates on the basis of foundational documents being the school records \u2013 Therefore, CBSE is obliged to carry out all necessary corrections to ensure that CBSE certificate is consistent with the relevant information furnished in the school records as it existed at the relevant time and future changes thereto including after the publication of results by the CBSE \u2013 However, when it comes to recording any information in the original certificate issued by the CBSE which is not consistent with the school records, it is essential that the CBSE must insist for supporting public document which has presumptive value and in the given case declaration by a Court of law to incorporate such a change \u2013 In that regard, the CBSE can insist for additional conditions to reassure itself and safeguard its interest against any claim by a third party/ body because of changes incorporated by it pursuant to application made by the candidate \u2013 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Examination Byelaws of 2007 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19. Education/Educational Institutions: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) \u2013 Correction/change in certificates issued by the Board \u2013 Whether the CBSE / Board is obliged to carry out corrections/changes in the certificates issued by it owing to correction/updation of public records/ documents which have statutory presumption of genuineness \u2013 Held: There is no reason for the CBSE Board to not take notice of the public documents relied upon by the candidate and to record change on that basis in the certificate issued by it, for being consistent with the relied upon public documents \u2013 It matters not if the information furnished in the public documents is not entirely consistent with the school records of the incumbent \u2013 CBSE while accepting those documents as foundational documents for effecting changes consistent therewith may insist for additional conditions and at the same time while retaining the original entry make note in the form of caption/ annotation in the fresh certificate to be issued by it while calling upon the incumbent to surrender the original certificate issued by it to avoid any misuse thereof at a later point of time \u2013 It would be permissible for the CBSE to insist for a sworn affidavit to be given by the incumbent making necessary declaration and also to indemnify the CBSE \u2013 The fresh certificate to be issued by the CBSE may also contain disclaimer of the Board clearly mentioning that change has been effected at the behest of the incumbent in light of the public documents relied upon by him \u2013 In addition, the incumbent can be called upon to notify about the change in the Official Gazette and by giving public notice as precondition for recording the change by way of abundant precaution \u2013 When a student applies to a Court of law for prior permission and/or declaration and produces public document(s), the Court would enter upon an inquiry wherein the legal presumption would operate in favour of the public document(s) and burden would shift on the party opposing the change to rebut the presumption or oppose the claim on any other ground \u2013 The question of genuineness of the document including its contents would be adjudicated in the same inquiry and the Court of law would permit the desired change only upon verifying the official records and upon being satisfied of its genuineness \u2013 At the same time, the question of justiciability of the requested changes would be considered and only upon being satisfied with the need demonstrated by the student, the Court would grant its permission \u2013 The said permission can then be placed before the Board along with copy of publication in the official gazette and requisite (prescribed) fee (if any) \u2013 The Board would then have no locus to make further enquirynor would be required to enter upon any further verification exercise \u2013 While considering requests for changes in certificates, CBSE cannot act as a court and it cannot effectively consider any request over and above those requests that merely require bringing the certificates in conformity with the school records or public documents, as the case may be \u2013 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Examination Byelaws of 2007. Education/Educational Institutions: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) \u2013 Examination Byelaws of the Board \u2013 Corrections/changes in certificates issued by the Board \u2013 Period of limitation for correction of the certificates \u2013 Whether the Examination Byelaws in force on the date of examination conducted by CBSE or the date of consideration of the application for recording correction/change would be relevant \u2013 And, whether the effect of correction or change, as the case may be, will have retrospective effect from the date of issue of the original certificate \u2013 Held: The Byelaws existing on the date of declaration/publication of result and issue of certificate would be relevant for the purpose of effecting changes in the certificates \u2013 If the limitation of applicability of Byelaws was to be reckoned from the date of application for correction/change and not the date of result of the examination conducted by CBSE, that would be leaving things to a state of uncertainty \u2013 Once changes are permitted in the documents of CBSE, it does not ipso facto mean that the changes are given a retrospective effect \u2013 The changes are indeed prospective and to signify that a remedial measure is provided in the Byelaws, as existing presently \u2013 They provide for the requirement of adding a caption/ annotation with the date of such change along with the changed particulars so as to indicate within the certificate that the changes have been made on a date subsequent to the date of publishing the certificates \u2013 The requirement of caption/annotation is indeed a sufficient safeguard to prevent the usage of subsequently altered documents as unchanged original records \u2013 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Examination Byelaws of 2007.Education/Educational Institutions: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) \u2013 Correction/change in certificates issued by the Board \u2013 Whether writ of mandamus issued for effecting corrections in CBSE certificates can be in the teeth of explicitprovisions in the examination byelaws, without examining validity of the byelaws \u2013 Held: The High Courts, being constitutional Courts, are duly vested with the power to review any law in light of Part-III \u2013 There cannot be mechanical directions by way of mandamus to a public authority without going into the veracity of the claims and without sufficiently explaining why the case demands extraordinary treatment \u2013 The Courts need to be extra cautious and alive to the immediate factual position before permitting changes \u2013 No two requests for change of name or change in date of birth can be viewed with the same judicial eye \u2013 Sometimes, change of name could be a necessity, sometimes it could be a pure exercise of freewill without any need \u2013 As long as Byelaws or the applicable rules permit so, there is no occasion for any court to deny such relief \u2013 But when Byelaws do not permit for the same, the Court must be circumspect before issuing directions, that too without commenting upon the validity of the Byelaws and without demonstrating the rights which are at stake \u2013 constitutional or legal \u2013 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Examination Byelaws of 2007 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Part III. Education/Educational Institutions: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) \u2013 Correction/change in certificates issued by the Board \u2013 Nature of correction or change, as the case may be, permissible to be carried by the CBSE at the instance of the student including past student \u2013 Held: Broadly, two situations would arise \u2013 The first is where the incumbent wants \u201ccorrection\u201d in the certificate issued by the CBSE to be made consistent with the particulars mentioned in the school records \u2013 There is no reason for the CBSE to turn down such request or attach any precondition except reasonable period of limitation and keeping in mind the period for which the CBSE has to maintain its record under the extant regulations \u2013 CBSE cannot impose precondition of applying for correction consistent with the school records only before publication of results \u2013 Such a condition would be unreasonable and excessive \u2013 However, if the request for recording change is based on changed school records post the publication of results and issue of certificate by the CBSE, the candidate would be entitled to apply for recording such a change within the reasonable limitation period prescribed by the CBSE \u2013 As regards request for \u201cchange\u201d of particulars in the certificate issued by the CBSE, it presupposes that the particulars intended to be recorded in the CBSE certificate are not consistent with the school records \u2013 Such a request could be made in two different situations \u2013 The first is on the basis of public documents like Birth Certificate, Aadhaar Card/Election Card, etc. and to incorporate change in the CBSE certificate consistent therewith \u2013 The second possibility is when the request for change is due to the acquired name by choice at a later point of time \u2013 That change need not be backed by public documents pertaining to the candidate \u2013 Reverting to the first category, there is a legal presumption in relation to the public documents as envisaged in the 1872 Act \u2013 Such public documents, therefore, cannot be ignored by the CBSE \u2013 Taking note of those documents, the CBSE may entertain the request for recording change in the certificate issued by it \u2013 This, however, need not be unconditional, but subject to certain reasonable conditions to be fulfilled by the applicant as may be prescribed by the CBSE \u2013 The fresh certificate may contain disclaimer and caption/annotation against the original entry (except in respect of change of name effected in exercise of right to be forgotten) indicating the date on which change has been recorded and the basis thereof \u2013 However, in the latter situation where the change is to be effected on the basis of new acquired name without any supporting school record or public document, that request may be entertained upon insisting for prior permission/declaration by a Court of law in that regard and publication in the Official Gazette including surrender/return of original certificate (or duplicate original certificate, as the case may be) issued by CBSE and upon payment of prescribed fees \u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss.76 r/w ss.79, 80 and 81."
