Doctrines / Principles \u2013 Principle of contra proferentem \u2013Explained \u2013 Held: The principle of contra proferentem is ordinarilyutilised in contracts of insurance and standard form contracts \u2013The principle apparently in substance is that in case of any doubt in its terms, the doubt should be resolved against the party whodrafted the contract."

\u2018Law\u2019 would mean all laws includingElectricity Laws in force in India and any statute, ordinance,regulations, orders, Notification or code, rules, or any interpretationof any of them by an Indian Governmental Instrumentality andhaving force of law \u2013 It shall also include all rules, regulations,decisions and orders of the CERC and the MERC \u2013 Thus, all suchadditional charges which are payable on account of orders,directions, Not if ications, Regulations, etc. , issued by theinstrumentalities of the State after the cut-off date will have to beconsidered to be \u2018Change in Law\u2019 events \u2013 The Generators wouldbe entitled to compensation on the restitutionary principle on suchchanges occurring after the cut-off date \u2013 Revision of charges tobe paid on Busy Season Surcharge, Development Surcharge andPort Congestion Charges from time to time by the \u2018Railway Board\u2019would come within the ambit of \u2018Change in Law\u2019 \u2013 Notifications bywhich MoEF mandated power projects to use beneficiated coal withash content lower than 34% would also amount to \u201cChange in Law\u2019\u2013 Further, change in NCDP would also amount to \u2018Change in Law\u2019\u2013 With regard to forest tax, as on the cut-off date there was noForest Tax applicable on coal mined and transported from SouthEastern Coalfields Limited mines located in Forest area \u2013 For thefirst time, vide Notification of the Forest Department, Governmentof Chhattisgarh a fee was levied \u2013 Said notification issued by theForest Department of the Government of Chhattisgarh, which is aninstrumentality of the State would also be a \u2018Change in Law\u2019 \u2013 Noerror in the finding of the APTEL in that regard \u2013 Also, \u2018add onpremium\u2019 was required to be paid on account of cancellation of captive coal blocks and inordinate delay on account of Go-No-Gopolicy \u2013 As such, it cannot be said that the reasoning adopted bythe APTEL is perverse and arbitrary \u2013 EFC imposed by CIL whichis an instrumentality of the State, circular of CIL would also amountto \u2018Change in Law\u2019 \u2013 In the light of said findings, each of the appealsconsidered independently, dismissed \u2013 Electricity Act, 2003.Electricity \u2013 Carrying cost \u2013 Grant of interest \u2013 Held: Oncecarrying cost has been granted, it cannot be urged that interest oncarrying cost should be calculated on simple interest basis insteadof compound interest basis \u2013 Grant of compound interest on carryingcost and that too from the date of the occurrence of the \u2018Change inLaw\u2019 event is based on sound logic \u2013 It aimed at restituting a partythat is adversely affected by a \u2018Change in Law\u2019 event and restore itto its original economic position as if such a \u2018Change in Law\u2019 eventhad not taken place \u2013 In view of the consistent position of law andapplication of restitutionary principles and privity of contractualobligations between the parties as contained in the Power PurchaseAgreements, the view taken by the APTEL with regard to carryingcost warrants no interference \u2013 Electricity Act, 2003.Electricity Act, 2003 \u2013 s.125 \u2013 Appeals arising from concurrentfindings of fact arrived at by two statutory bodies having expertisein the field \u2013 Held: CERC, SERCs and APTEL are bodies consistingof experts in the field \u2013 This Court should be slow in interferingwith the concurrent findings of fact unless they are found to beperverse, arbitrary and either in ignorance of or contrary to thestatutory provisions \u2013 Appeal to this Court u/s.125 is only permissibleon any of the grounds as specified in s.100 of the Code of CivilProcedure, 1908 \u2013 As such, the appeal to this Court would bepermissible only on substantial questions of law \u2013 However, even incases where well-reasoned concurrent orders are passed by the ERCand APTEL, the same are challenged by the DISCOMS as well asthe Generators \u2013 On account of pendency of litigation, which insome of the cases in this batch has been more than 5 years, nonpaymentof dues would entail paying of heavy carrying cost to theGenerators by the DISCOMS, which, in turn, will be passed over tothe end consumer \u2013 As a result, it will be the end consumer whowould be at sufferance \u2013 Therefore, such unnecessary andunwarranted litigation needs to be curbed \u2013 Union of India, through Ministry of Power, may evolve a mechanism to ensure timely paymentby the DISCOMS to the Generating Companies, which would avoidhuge carrying cost to be passed over to the end consumers \u2013 Amechanism may also be evolved to avoid unnecessary andunwarranted litigation, the cost of which is also passed on to theultimate consumer \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 s.100."

Suit \u2013 Partition suit \u2013 Preliminary decree \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held:A preliminary decree in a suit for partition merely declares the sharesthat the parties are entitled to in any of the properties included inthe plaint schedule and liable to partition \u2013 On the basis of a meredeclaration of the rights that take place under the preliminary decree,the parties cannot trade in, on specific items of properties or specificportions of suit schedule properties \u2013 Since there are three stagesin a partition suit, namely (i) passing of a preliminary decree interms of Order XX Rule 18(2); (ii) appointment of a Commissionerand passing of a final decree in terms of Order XXVI Rule 14(3);and (iii) taking possession in execution of such decree under OrderXXI Rule 35, no party to a suit for partition, even by way ofcompromise, can acquire any title to any specific item of propertyor any particular portion of a specific property, if such a compromiseis struck only with a few parties to the suit \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure,1908 \u2013 Order XX, r.18(2); Order XXVI, r.14(3) and Order XXI, r.35.Suit \u2013 Partition suit \u2013 Held: In a suit for partition, the CivilCourt cannot go into the question of title, unless the same isincidental to the fundamental premise of the claim."

the House \u2013 Power of the Governorto call for Floor Test \u2013 After the State elections in 2019, a coalitiongovernment of Maha Vikas Agadi (MVA) [a post-poll alliance ofShiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), Indian NationalCongress (INC) and some independent MLAs] was formed inMaharashtra, with Mr. Thackeray of Shiv Sena as the Chief Minister\u2013 However, certain events transpired in mid-2022 which led to splitin Shiv Sena into two factions, one led by Mr. Thackeray and theother led by Mr. Shinde \u2013 34 Shiv Sena MLAs (of Shinde Group)issued notice to Deputy Speaker stating that he no longer enjoyedtheir support and calling upon him to move a motion for his ownremoval \u2013 In the meanwhile, notices were issued by the DeputySpeaker on petition filed by the Chief Whip of petitioners (ThackerayGroup) under Tenth Schedule to the Constitution for disqualificationof MLAs of Shinde Group \u2013 Governor, pursuant to letter addressedby the Opposition Party, called upon the Thackeray Group to provemajority on the floor of the House \u2013 Thackeray resigned on thevery next day and thereafter a new Govt. was formed by a coalitionconsisting of BJP MLAs and rebel MLAs of Shiv Sena, with Mr.Shinde as the Chief Minister \u2013Discretion and power of governor toinvite a person to form the Government \u2013 Extent of \u2013 Held: Thediscretion to call for a floor test is not an unfettered discretion butone that must be exercised with circumspection, in accordance withthe limits placed on it by law \u2013 The Governor had no objectivematerial on the basis of which he could doubt the confidence of the incumbent government \u2013 The resolution on which the Governorrelied did not contain any indication that the MLAs wished to exitfrom the MVA government \u2013 Communication expressing discontenton the part of some MLAs is not sufficient for the Governor to callfor a floor test \u2013 The Governor ought to apply his mind to thecommunication or other material before him to assess whether theGovernment seemed to have lost the confidence of the House \u2013 The34 Shiv Sena MLAs did not express their desire to withdraw supportfrom the MVA Government in the resolution \u2013 The floor test cannotbe used as a medium to resolve internal party disputes or intra partydisputes \u2013 In the present case, the Governor did not have anyobjective material before him to indicate that the incumbentgovernment had lost the confidence of the House and that he shouldcall for a floor test \u2013 Hence, exercise of discretion by the Governorin this case was not in accordance with law \u2013 The Governor wasnot justified in calling upon Mr. Thackeray to prove his majority onthe floor of the House because he did not have reasons based onobjective material before him, to reach the conclusion that Mr.Thackeray had lost the confidence of the House \u2013 However, thestatus quo ante cannot be restored because Mr. Thackeray did notface the floor test and tendered his resignation \u2013 The Governorwas justified in inviting Mr. Shinde to form the government.Constitution of India \u2013 Art.153 \u2013 Position of Governor \u2013 InInternal Disputes of a Political Party \u2013 Split in Political Party \u2013Held: The Governor is the titular head of the State Government \u2013He is a constitutional functionary who derives his authority fromthe Constitution and he cannot exercise a power that is not conferredon him by the Constitution or a law made under it \u2013 Neither theConstitution nor the laws enacted by Parliament provide for amechanism by which disputes amongst members of a particularpolitical party can be settled \u2013 They certainly do not empower theGovernor to enter the political arena and play a role (howeverminute) either in inter-party disputes or in intra-party disputes.Constitution of India: Tenth Schedule and Arts.32 & 226 \u2013Power and Jurisdiction of Court \u2013 To adjudicate uponDisqualifications of Legislative Members \u2013 Held: Disqualificationof a person for being a member of the House has drasticconsequences for the member concerned and by extension, for thecitizens of that constituency \u2013 Supreme Court should normally refrain from deciding disqualification petitions at the first instance, havingdue regard to constitutional intendment \u2013 The question ofdisqualification ought to be adjudicated by the constitutionalauthority concerned, namely the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly,by following the procedure prescribed \u2013 The Speaker must decidedisqualification petitions within a reasonable period.Constitution of India: Art.181 \u2013 Reference to Larger Bench \u2013Whether a notice for removal of a Speaker restricts them fromcontinuing with disqualification proceedings under Tenth Scheduleas held by this Court in Nabam Rebia \u2013 Held: Although the decisionin Nabam Rebia is not applicable to the factual scenario, however,Nabam Rebia is in conflict with the judgement in Kihoto Hollohan \u2013 Itappears that the majority in Nabam Rebia did not consider the effectand import of Article 181 of Constitution of India \u2013 Hence, thedecision in Nabam Rebia merits reference to a larger Bench becausea substantial question of law remains to be settled.Constitution of India: Tenth Schedule \u2013 MaharashtraLegislative Members (Removal of

between Political Party and Legislature Party \u2013 Held:The political party and not the legislature party appoints the Whipand the Leader \u2013 The Tenth Schedule would become unworkable ifthe term \u2018political party\u2019 is read as the \u2018legislature party\u2019 \u2013 A cleardemarcation is made between political party and legislature partyfor the purpose of a merger under Paragraph 4 \u2013 To read the term\u2018political party\u2019 as \u2018legislature party\u2019 would be contrary to the plainlanguage of the Tenth Schedule \u2013 Direction to vote in a particularmanner or to abstain from voting is issued by the political partyand not the legislature party \u2013 The Speaker must recognize the Whipand the Leader who are duly authorised by the political party afterconducting an enquiry in this regard.Constitution of India \u2013 Arts. 189(2) and 190(3) \u2013 Decision ofSpeaker \u2013 Disqualification of Member \u2013 Validity of Proceedings ofthe

House inthe interregnum is not \u201csubject to\u201d outcome of the disqualification petitions \u2013 Decision of the Speaker does not relate back to the datewhen the MLA indulged in prohibitory conduct \u2013 The decision ofthe Speaker and the consequences of disqualification areprospective \u2013 If a member incurs disqualification under the TenthSchedule, it does not automatically result in their expulsion fromthe political party to which they belong.Constitution of India \u2013 Tenth Schedule \u2013 Election Symbols(Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 \u2013 Para 15 \u2013 Held: TheSpeaker and the ECI are empowered to concurrently adjudicate onthe petitions before them under the Tenth Schedule and underParagraph 15 of the Symbols Order respectively.Election Symbols (Reservation and Allotment) Order, 1968 \u2013Para 15 \u2013 Held: While adjudicating petitions under Paragraph 15of the Symbols Order, the ECI may apply a test that is best suited tothe facts and circumstances of the case before it.Constitution of India \u2013 Tenth Schedule \u2013 Para 2(1) and Para3 \u2013Deletion of Paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule \u2013 Effect of \u2013Held: Is that the defence of \u2018split\u2019 is no longer available to membersfacing disqualification proceedings \u2013 The Speaker would prima faciedetermine who the political party is for the purpose of adjudicatingdisqualification petitions under Paragraph 2(1) of the TenthSchedule, where two or more factions claim to be that political party\u2013 When there are two Whips appointed by two or more factions ofthe political party, the Speaker decides which of the two Whipsrepresents the political partyConstitution of India \u2013 Tenth Schedule \u2013 Para 2 & 3 \u2013 ElectionSymbols

Thetest of majority in the legislative and organisational wings of theparty is not the only or primary test \u2013 The ECI is free to fashion atest suited to the facts and complexities of the specific case before it\u2013 In some cases, it is futile to assess which group enjoys a majorityin the legislature \u2013 Other tests include an evaluation of the majorityin the organisational wings of the political party, an analysis of theprovisions of the party constitution, or any other appropriate test \u2013ECI to refrain from passing a subjective judgment on the approachespreferred by rival factions by applying the test of whether rival groups are adhering to the aims and objects of the party asincorporated in its constitution \u2013 Decision of ECI need not beconsistent with the decision of the Speaker \u2013 Decision of the ECIhas prospective effect \u2013 Disqualification proceedings before theSpeaker cannot be stayed in anticipation of the decision of theECI.Constitution of India \u2013 Art.164(1B) \u2013 Appointment of ChiefMinister \u2013 Pending disqualification petitions \u2013 Held: Disqualificationis triggered only if disqualification incurred under the

Tamil Nadu \u2013 Whether withoutidentifying the proceeds of crime/a property representing theproceeds of crime and any process or activity connected to proceedsof crime as required by s.3, which constitute the foundational/jurisdictional fact, can ED initiate an investigation and issuesummons \u2013 Held: All the three FIRs alleged that the accused hadcommitted offences included in the schedule by taking illegalgratification for providing appointment to several persons in thePublic Transport Corporation \u2013 It is the bribe money that constitutesthe proceeds of crime u/s.2(1)(u) \u2013 A public servant receiving illegalgratification is in possession of proceeds of crime \u2013 Mere generationof proceeds of crime is sufficient to constitute the offence of moneylaundering\u2013 In s.3 there are 6 activities or process and one of themis \u201cacquisition\u201d \u2013 If a person takes a bribe, he acquires proceedsof crime, hence, activity of \u201cacquisition\u201d takes place \u2013 Even if hedoes not retain it but \u201cuses\u201d it, he will be guilty of offence of moneylaundering,since \u201cuse\u201d is one of the activities mentioned in s.3 \u2013The FIRs for the predicate offences identify all the three componentsof s.3, persons; process; and product \u2013 Corruption money representsthe proceeds of crime \u2013 In the case of an offence of corruption, thecriminal activity and the generation of the proceeds of crime arelike Siamese twins \u2013 The contention that the investigation by EDwas triggered without any foundational/jurisdictional facts are aimedat hoodwinking the Court \u2013 Wherever there are allegations ofcorruption, there is acquisition of proceeds of crime which itselftantamount to money-laundering \u2013 Once an information relating tothe acquisition of huge amount of illegal gratification in the matterof public employment has come in the public domain, it is the dutyof the ED to register an Information Report \u2013 This is because \u201cacquisition\u201d is an activity amounting to money-laundering andthe illegal gratification acquired by a public servant represents\u201cproceeds of crime\u201d, generated through a criminal activity in respectof a scheduled offence \u2013 Receipt of bribe money is an act of moneylaundering\u2013 All the arguments on facts and all the legal contentionsemanating from some portions of the judgment in Vijay MadanlalChoudhary, to challenge the validity of the proceedings initiated byED are completely unsustainable.Criminal Law \u2013 Matters pertaining to Jobs-for-cash scam inthe State of Tamil Nadu \u2013 Impugned order allowed de novoinvestigation on a ground not raised in the petition \u2013 Held: \u2018D\u2019,whose original complaint led to the registration of FIR in CrimeNo.441 of 2015 seems to have had a genuine grievance against theculprits at the bottom of the layer, but he later turned out to be aTrojan horse, willing to sabotage the investigation against influentialpersons \u2013 Order directing de novo investigation in all the three cases,actually inured to the benefit of the accused, but the High Courtput it on the ground that the credibility of the investigation shouldnot be eroded \u2013 In fact, the accused did not seek de novo investigationon the ground of slackness on the part of the Investigating Officer,but it was \u2018D\u2019 who sought it, with the able assistance of theInvestigating Officer \u2013 What is shocking is that the High Courtdirected reinvestigation to be started ab initio, wiping out the earlierinvestigation altogether \u2013 By issuing the said direction, the HighCourt not only directed the wiping out of the investigation carriedout so far, but virtually wiped out even the judgment of SupremeCourt dtd.08.09.2022 passed in the previous round of litigation \u2013The problem with the impugned order is not merely one of improperusage of language, as sought to be diluted by the accused and thecomplainant, but something more \u2013 Prevention of Money LaunderingAct, 2002 \u2013Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Doctrine of stare decisis \u2013 Whether inthe light of the fact that notice has been ordered in the review petitionand a few interim orders have been passed in some proceedings, itis necessary for this Court to tag these appeals along with a reviewpetition or defer the hearing of these matters until a decision isrendered in the review petition and other petitions \u2013 Held: A noticeordered in the review petition will not destroy or diminish theprecedential value of Vijay Madanlal Choudhary \u2013 The argument ofthe counsel for the accused, if accepted, will not only destroy theprinciples of judicial discipline and the doctrine of stare decisis, butalso bring to a grinding halt, all pending investigation in the country\u2013 Accused is not entitled at all either to seek a reference to a largerBench or to seek to defer the matter till a decision is rendered in thematters involving larger issues \u2013 Appeals arising out of the order ofthe Division Bench of the High Court are allowed \u2013 Order of theDivision Bench of the High Court dtd. 01.09.2022 is set aside \u2013 EDentitled to proceed further from the stage at which their hands weretied by the impugned order \u2013 Prevention of Money

rr.231(3), 237 \u2013 Appellantcontended that the High Court overlooked the provisions of r.231(3)and also s.65B, Evidence Act \u2013 Held: Both the contentions are withoutsubstance \u2013 r.231 primarily deals with the grant of certified copiesof certain other documents to the accused, before filing of the FinalReport \u2013 It states that certified copies of unmarked documents shallnot be given \u2013 High Court has not passed any order directing thegrant of certified copies of unmarked documents \u2013 It has onlypermitted the ED to have an inspection of the documents u/r.237and thereafter to file a proper copy application \u2013 This is not contraryto r.231(3) \u2013 Further, it is not known how an argument revolvingaround s.65B, Evidence Act is raised \u2013 s.65B concerns theadmissibility of electronic records \u2013 Without certification, ED maynot be able to use those electronic records in evidence, in theprosecution under PMLA \u2013 But it does not mean that they cannoteven have a look at the electronic record \u2013 Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013s.65B \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 \u2013Prevention ofCorruption Act, 1988 \u2013 Criminal Law.Criminal Law \u2013 Matters pertaining to Jobs-for-cash scam inthe State of Tamil Nadu \u2013 Objection to the maintainability of theappeals by appellants, against the order of de novo investigation \u2013Held: Criminal jurisprudence recognizes a limited role of victimsand it is the state which is entrusted with the onerous responsibilityof prosecuting the accused and getting them punished \u2013 These theories of law were developed when process of administration ofcriminal justice system was largely unpolluted \u2013 However, wheresome of the complainants and the accused have come together toform an unholy alliance, victims cannot be left at the mercy of suchpartnerships \u2013 What was compromised between the complainantand accused is not just their disputes, but justice, fair play, goodconscience and the fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence\u2013 Investigation trail of a criminal case cannot be converted by thecomplainant and accused into a friendly match \u2013 Further,submissions made on the question of locus in the previous round oflitigation in were rejected by Supreme Court in the very sameproceedings in the first round \u2013 Therefore, the accused cannot raisethe question of locus again and again.Criminal Rules of Practice, 2019 \u2013 rr.207(12), 210 \u2013 Some ofthe appellants filed copies of the confession statements u/s.164,CrPC, as part of the paper book in the appeals \u2013 It was contendedthat the confession statements recorded before the Magistrate aresacrosanct and that the copies of the same cannot be made availableto third parties \u2013 Held: It is clear from r.207(12) that a confessionstatement is a confidential document till the time investigation iscomplete and Final Report filed \u2013 r. 210 enables \u201cthird parties toapply to the Court for the grant of copies of Judgment or order orany proceeding or document in the custody of a Court\u201d \u2013 Therefore,it is not as though the appellants have filed something to which theycould have never had any access \u2013 Further, many of the documentshad started appearing in the public domain at the instance of severalpersons \u2013 Hence, it is futile to contend that the appeals are liable tobe thrown out on the ground that the appellants came up withdocuments to which they could not have had any access \u2013 Code ofCriminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.164.Criminal Law \u2013 Matters pertaining to Jobs-for-cash scam inthe State of Tamil Nadu \u2013 Political vendetta alleged \u2013 On the basisof the timeline of events, it was alleged the Minister was implicatedin the case on 08.03.2021, for offences under the PC Act immediatelyafter the announcement of the elections to the Legislative Assembly,as he had switched over from the party in power to another \u2013 Held:That the Investigation Officer did not choose to include the offencesunder the PC Act from the year 2015 till 08.03.2021, cannot be taken to the credit of the Minister, but should be taken as a discreditof the prosecution \u2013 If the shield of office protected him from 2015till he formed part of the splinter group and the shield stoodtemporarily removed for a brief period of time until he again becamea Minister in the next regime, the same cannot be said to be a caseof political vendetta \u2013 Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.Practice and Procedure \u2013 For all the accused in the PMLAcase, arguments were advanced for the grant of larger reliefs thanwhat they got under the impugned order, without even filing anyappeal against the same \u2013 Held: It is possible in law for a successfulparty (though in civil proceedings) to support the decree withoutsupporting the judgment \u2013 But what the accused sought to do beforeSupreme Court was to support the judgment and seek an enlargementof the decree, without independently filing appeals \u2013 Since theytook a chance by adopting such a course, they may not even beable to challenge the impugned order hereafter, once the seal ofapproval on the same is affixed by this Court and the doctrine ofmerger comes into play \u2013 Prevention of Money Laundering Act,2002 \u2013 Doctrines/Principles \u2013 Doctrine of merger."
