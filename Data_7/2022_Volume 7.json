Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss. 25, 26, 27 \u2013 Confession \u2013 Admissibility of \u2013 Held: No part of a First Information Report lodged by an accused with the police as an implicatory statement can be admitted into evidence \u2013 However, the statement can be admitted to identify the accused as the maker of the report \u2013 Further, that part of the information in the statement, which is distinctly related to the \u2018fact\u2019 discovered in consequence of such information, can also be admitted into evidence u/s.27 of the Evidence Act, provided that the discovery of the fact must be in relation to a material object."

Income Tax Act, 1961: Chapter IV, Part D, ss.28, 36 \u2013 Scope \u2013 The income of every assessee has to be assessed as per Chapter IV, Part D of the Act \u2013 s.28 deals with the chargeability of income to tax under the head \u2018Profits and Gains of Business or Profession\u2019 \u2013 The other deductions is given u/s.36 of the Act, which opens with the phrase \u201cthe deductions provided for in the following clauses shall be allowed in respect of the matters dealt with therein, in computing the income referred to in s.28\u201d \u2013 For the purposes of computing income chargeable to tax, therefore, besides specific deductions, \u2018other deductions\u2019 enumerated in different clauses of s.36 can be allowed by the AO \u2013 Each of the deductions must relate to the business carried out by the assessee \u2013 If the assessee carries on a business and writes off a debt relating to the business as irrecoverable, it would be entitled to a corresponding deduction under clause (vii) of sub-section (1) of s.36 subject to the fulfilment of the conditions set forth in sub-section (2) of s.36 of the IT Act. Income Tax Act, 1961: s.36(1)(vii) \u2013 Amendment of 1989 \u2013 Pre and Post amendment position \u2013 Before the amendment in 1989, even in cases where the assessee had made only a provision in its accounts for bad debts and interest thereon, without the amount actually being debited from the assessee\u2019s Profit and Loss account, the assessee could still claim deduction under s.36(1)(vii) of the Act \u2013 With effect from 1 April 1989, with the insertion of the new Explanation under s.36(1)(vii), any bad debt written-off as irrecoverable in the account of the assessee would not include any \u2018provision\u2019 for bad and doubtful debt made in the accounts of the assessee \u2013 In other words, before this date, even a provision could be treated as a write off, however, after this date, as per the Explanation to s.36(1)(vii), a mere provision for bad debt per se was not entitled to deduction under s.36(1)(vii)."

        "HeadNote": "Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.302 r/w s.34 \u2013 Murder \u2013 Common intention \u2013 On the fateful night at about 3 a.m., the victim and his wife (eye witness) woke up and while the wife was doing preparations for cooking, the husband went to attend to the nature\u2019s call \u2013 Wife heard his shouts, when she ran to the site she saw two accused assaulting her husband with an axe whereas the appellants had caught hold of him \u2013 She found him bleeding, he also told her that four of them had caught hold of him and assaulted him by an axe \u2013 He was taken to hospital, was declared brought dead \u2013 Appellants were acquitted by trial court noticing that the role attributed to them was of catching the victim without actual participation or use of weapon to assault and inflict injuries, other two accused were convicted \u2013 High Court dismissed the appeal of the convicted accused, while the acquittal of appellants was reversed \u2013 SLP filed by the two accused who used the axe was dismissed \u2013 Held: Concurrently both the Courts have held that the witnesses were reliable, more so the wife of the deceased \u2013 There is no quibble with the manner in which the incident occurred or the identifying of all the accused \u2013 The very presence of all the accused at 3.30 in the morning at the site with two of them holding an axe clearly shows that there can be no doubt about a common intention in behalf of what they were proposing to do \u2013 It was not an axe picked up at the site \u2013 Two of the accused were carrying the axes \u2013 It is not a sudden incident which had occurred \u2013 The premeditated intention was clear \u2013 Even at the site, the intentions had never changed as the appellants were holding the deceased while the other two attacked \u2013 The fact that only two of them used the axe while the other were two holding the deceased to ensure appropriate injuries being inflicted on the deceased would give no remission to the case of the appellants \u2013 No fault in High Court reversing the acquittal. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.34 \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Common intention \u2013 Evidence \u2013 Held: s.34 creates a deeming fiction by infusing and importing a criminal act constituting an offence committed by one, into others, in pursuance to a common intention \u2013 This would require the quality of evidence to be substantial, concrete, definite and clear. Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.34 \u2013 Common intention \u2013 Principle of constructive liability \u2013 Held: Dominant feature of s.34 is an element of intention and participation in action \u2013 This participation need not in all cases even be physical presence but a common intention \u2013 There has to be a simultaneous consensus of minds of the persons participating in the criminal action to bring about a particular result \u2013 That intention can be formed at any time \u2013 s.34 does not create any distinct offence but it lays down the principle of constructive liability stipulating that the act must be done in furtherance of the common intention."

The interpretation given by the High Court to Rule 25(2) of the Rules is a plausible interpretation Constitution of India: The State is bound by the fundamental rights of its employees under Arts.14 to 16 of the Constitution of India \u2013 It is now well settled that arbitrariness violates the right to equality under Arts.14 to 16 of the Constitution of India. Writ jurisdiction: Relief under Art.226 of the Constitution of India being discretionary, the Courts might in their discretion refuse to entertain the Writ Petition, where there is gross delay on the part of the Writ Petitioner, particularly, where the relief sought would, if granted, unsettle things, which are already settled \u2013 In the instant case, although there was a delay of six years in filing the writ petition, however, the laws of limitation do not apply to exercise of jurisdiction under Art.226 of the Constitution of India \u2013 Respondent-Writ Petitioner is claiming pension, which is a life long benefit \u2013 Denial of pension is a continuing wrong \u2013 When financial rules framed by the Government such as Pension Rules are capable of more interpretations than one, the Courts should lean towards that interpretation which goes in favour of the employee."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: Stage of charge framing \u2013 Approach of Court \u2013 Court has to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged \u2013 Court is not required to go deep into the probative value of the materials on record. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.239 \u2013 Prima facie case u/s.239 \u2013 If the Magistrate considers the charge against the accused to be groundless, he shall discharge the accused \u2013 The word \u2018groundless\u2019 means that there must be no ground for presuming that the accused has committed the offence and that the materials placed before the Court do not make out or are not sufficient to make out a prima facie case against the accused \u2013 If no prima facie case regarding the commission of any offence is made out, it would amount to a charge being groundless.

Principles/Doctrines \u2013 Doctrine of Eclipse, conflict and repugnancy \u2013 The moment the Parliament stepped in to codify the law relating to registration and regulation of NBFCs, by inserting certain provisions in Chapter III-B of the RBI Act, the same would cast a shadow on the applicability of the provisions of the Kerala Act to NBFCs registered under the RBI Act and regulated by RBI \u2013 In case of Gujarat, State of Gujarat contended that the Gujarat Act exempts NBFCs registered under the RBI Act from seeking registration under the Gujarat Act \u2013 However, u/s. 5(2) of the Gujarat Act, NBFCs registered under the RBI Act are deemed to have been registered under the Gujarat Act \u2013 Gujarat Act, 2011 tacitly recognizes the regulation of NBFCs under the RBI Act \u2013 Yet the State got the assent of only the Governor \u2013 Therefore, Kerala Act and the Gujarat Act will have no application to NBFCs registered under the RBI Act and regulated by RBI \u2013 Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (RBI Act) \u2013 Kerala Money Lenders Act,1958 (Kerala Act) \u2013 Gujarat Money Lenders Act, 2011 (Gujarat Act)."
