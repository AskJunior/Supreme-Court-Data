        "HeadNote": "Gujarat Riots \u2013 Godhra incident of 27.2.2002, in which large number of Kar-sevaks, returning from Ayodhya, were burnt alive in train bogies \u2013 As aftermath of that incident, there was unrest and violence all across the State of Gujarat \u2013 A violent mob attacked the inhabitants of one Gulberg Society, killing 69 persons including the husband of appellant \u2013 Complaint dated 8.6.2006 of appellant to Director General of Police, Gujarat and other high officials inter alia containing allegations of \u201clarger conspiracy at the highest level\u201d which resulted into causing mass violence across the State during the relevant period \u2013 Such allegations founded on the alleged utterances made by the then Chief Minister while addressing the DGP, the then Chief Secretary and other senior officials of the State \u2013 Towards this, reference made to meeting held on 27.2.2002 evening in Gandhinagar, as testified in the affidavit of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar, the then Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) \u2013 Reliance placed on report of a private panel of former Judges of Supreme Court titled \u201cConcerned Citizens Tribunal\u201d which referred to testimony before them of late Mr. Haren Pandya, former Minister \u2013 Additionally, reliance placed on testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, the then Superintendent of Police (Security), who claimed to have attended the meeting convened by the then Chief Minister on 27.2.2002 \u2013 Held: The testimony of Mr. Sanjiv Bhatt, Mr. Haren Pandya and also of Mr. R.B. Sreekumar was only to sensationalize and politicize the matters in issue, although, replete with falsehood \u2013 There was a coalesced effort of the disgruntled officials of the State of Gujarat alongwith others to create sensation by making revelations which were false to their own knowledge \u2013 The falsity of their claims had been fully exposed by the SIT (appointed by Supreme Court) after a thorough investigation \u2013 To make out a case of larger criminal conspiracy, it is essential to establish a linkindicative of meeting of minds of the concerned persons for commission of the crime(s), committed during the relevant period across the State \u2013 No such link is forthcoming, much less had been unraveled and established in any of the nine cases investigated by the same SIT under the directions of Supreme Court \u2013 In light of the timely corrective measures taken by the State Government in right earnest and repeated public assurances given by the then Chief Minister that guilty will be punished for their crime(s), and to maintain peace, it would be beyond comprehension of any person of ordinary prudence to bear suspicion about the meeting of minds of named offenders and hatching of conspiracy by the State at the highest level, as alleged, much less grave or strong suspicion as being the quintessence for sending the accused for trial for an offence of criminal conspiracy \u2013 Breakdown of law-and-order situation if for short duration, cannot partake the colour of breakdown of rule of law or constitutional crisis \u2013 No fault found with the approach of the SIT in submitting final report for discarding the allegations regarding larger criminal conspiracy (at the highest level) for causing and precipitating mass violence across the State during the relevant period \u2013 Decision of the Magistrate in accepting the final report submitted by the SIT, is upheld as it is and the protest petition filed by the appellant is rejected \u2013 Submission of appellant regarding infraction of rule of law in the matter of investigation and the approach of the Magistrate and the High Court in dealing with the final report, cannot be countenanced \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.302 r/w s.120B, s.193 r/w s.114 and ss.185, 153A, 186 and 187 \u2013 Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952 \u2013 s.6 \u2013 Gujarat Police Act, 1951 \u2013 Human Rights Act, 1991. Constitution of India, 1950 \u2013 Art. 356 \u2013 Failure of Constitutional machinery \u2013 Breakdown of law and order \u2013 When made out \u2013 Held: Mis-governance or failure to maintain law-andorder during a brief period may not be a case of failure of constitutional machinery in the context of tenets embodied in Art.356 \u2013 There must be credible evidence regarding State sponsored breakdown of law-and-order situation; not spontaneous or isolated instances or events of failure of State administration to control the situation. Gujarat Riots \u2013 Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities \u2013 Forwarding of messages by the intelligence agencies including inaction or lack of effective measures taken by the concerned officials \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: It does not per se imply criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities \u2013 Inaction of the duty holders to take those messages (of intelligence agencies) to its logical end, cannot be regarded as act of criminal conspiracy unless there is material to provide link regarding the meeting of minds and deliberate act to effectuate a plan to spread mass violence across the State. Gujarat Riots \u2013 Allegations of criminal conspiracy on the part of the State authorities \u2013 Inaction or failure of some officials of one section of the State administration \u2013 Held: Cannot be the basis to infer a pre-planned criminal conspiracy by the authorities of the State Government or to term it as a State sponsored crime (violence)."

        "HeadNote": "Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 \u2013 Regulation 52 \u2013 Applicability \u2013 Regulation 52, which relates to and permits deduction of expenses including commission payable to the distributor, is applicable when the scheme is in operation, and not post the decision of the trustees in terms of Regulation 39(2)(a) read with Regulation 39(3), when, upon publication of notices, the ceasure mandate of Regulation 40 is triggered. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 \u2013 Regulations 40 and 52 \u2013 Held: Regulations 40 and 52 need to be read harmoniously \u2013 When read together, Regulation 52, authorising and specifying the limit of the fees and expenses payable to the asset management company, would apply only when the scheme is in operation, and not after publication of the notice under Clause (b) to sub-regulation 3 to Regulation 39 resulting in ceasure of any business activities in respect of the scheme to be wound up. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 \u2013 Regulation 41 \u2013 Applicability \u2013 Regulation 41, which deals with the procedure and manner of winding up, applies once the notice under Regulation 39(3)(b) is published and the unitholders\u2019 approval under Regulation 18(15)(c) of the Regulations is received. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 \u2013 Regulation 41 \u2013 Claim for entitlement to payment of commission under clause (b) to sub-regulation 2 to Regulation 41 \u2013 Held: In a given case, some of the recurring expenses mentioned in clause (b) to Regulation 52(4) like audit fee, insurance premium, cost of statutory advertisements, etc., would be covered and would satisfy the requirement of clause (b) to Regulation 41(2) \u2013 However, if and only when they fall under and meet the requirement of the expenses connected with the winding up can they be allowed under Regulation 41(2)(b) \u2013 Commission payable to the mutual fund distributers is certainly not an expense connected with the winding up of the scheme. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 \u2013 Regulation 39(2)(b) and 52(4) (b) \u2013 Claim for commission payment by mutual fund distributors as an amount \u2018due and payable under the scheme\u2019 , on ground that it was an amount or payment that had accrued before the publication of notices under Regulation 39(2)(b), but was not paid as it was payable in future \u2013 Held: Not tenable \u2013 The expression \u2018due and payable\u2019 has to be interpreted with reference to the context in which the words appear \u2013 In the context of the Regulations in question, the expression refers to the present liabilities which may be payable in praesenti or in future \u2013 There must be an existing obligation to pay though the appointed date of payment may not have arrived \u2013 Clause (b) to Regulation 52(4) refers to recurring expenses, that is, expenses which will recur from time to time \u2013 It does not refer to one-time payment which is deferred \u2013 The recurring liability is not a present liability, but an obligation which, on satisfaction of certain conditions, may accrue in future \u2013 The right to claim commission may not accrue and become due and payable \u2013 On and after publication of the winding up notice in terms of Regulation 39(3)(b), the trustees and the asset management company cannot claim any payment on account of recurring expenses under clause (b) to sub- regulation (4) to Regulation 52 \u2013 Words and Phrases \u2013 Expression \u2018due and payable\u2019. Security and Exchange Board of India (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 \u2013 Regulation 39(3)(b) and 41 \u2013 On publication of notices in terms of Regulation 39(3)(b), the business of the mutual fund comes to a stop and therefore, on and from that date the trail commission is not payable, as the scheme is to be wound up and the money is to be collected and paid to the unitholders, in terms of and as per the mandate of Regulation 41 \u2013 Even if a distributor renders some services to the unitholders after publication of the notice under Regulation 39(3)(b), it would not entitle him to claim an amount from the asset management company"

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s.397(2) \u2013 Revisional Jurisdiction of High Court in criminal matter \u2013 Scope of \u2013 The revisional jurisdiction u/s.397 of CrPC can be exercised against the final order of acquittal or conviction, or an intermediate order not being interlocutory order where the interest of the public justice requires to subvert manifest illegality and to prevent gross miscarriage of justice \u2013 In the present case, the order of the trial court declining to mark the statement of the informant as an exhibit is an intermediate order affecting important rights of the parties and cannot be said to be purely of an interlocutory nature \u2013 The revisional jurisdiction u/s 397 r/w 401 of CrPC is a discreationary in nature and can be exercised suo motu and there can be no bar on the third party invoking such jurisdiction inviting the attention of the High Court that an occasion to exercise the power has arisen \u2013 Since the order of the trial court is not interlocutory in nature and that the bar u/s.397(2) of the CrPC in inapplicable, a criminal revision filed by an appellant-informant against the said order of the trial court was maintainable."
