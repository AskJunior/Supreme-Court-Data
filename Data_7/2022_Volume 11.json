question ofavailability of fraud as a ground for winding up of a company \u2013Discussed \u2013 Held: The main departure of the Companies Act, 2013from the statutory regime of the Companies Act, 1956, is the specificinclusion of fraud, directly as one of the circumstances in which acompany could be wound up \u2013 s.271 of the 2013 Act lists out thecircumstances in which a company may be wound up \u2013 Fraud hasnow directly become (under the 2013 regime), one of thecircumstances in which a company could be wound up, though italso continues to be a ground indirectly, u/s 224(2) r/w section 213[as it was under Section 439(1) (f) r/w sections 243 and 237(b) ofthe 1956 Act] \u2013 Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.271 \u2013 Companies Act,1956.Company Law \u2013 Winding up of a company \u2013 Fraud as aground for winding up \u2013 Petition u/s.271(c) of the Companies Act,2013 \u2013 Advertisement of the company petition \u2013 Breach of \u2013 Onfacts, petition for winding up was never advertised nor even orderedto be advertised, either upon admission of the petition or anytimethereafter \u2013 Contention of appellants that this vitiated the wholeproceedings \u2013 Held: Sub-sections (1) and (2) of s.468 of the 2013Act empower the Central Government to make Rules providing forall matters relating to winding up of companies \u2013 In exercise of thepowers so conferred, the Companies (Winding up) Rules, 2020 wereissued \u2013 Since requirement to advertise a petition for winding up isstipulated in rr. 5 and 7 of the Companies (Winding up) Rules, 2020,what is prescribed in r.35 of the NCLT Rules 2016 would covereven petitions for winding up \u2013 Sub-rule (5) of r.35 makes it clearthat even in cases where direction of the Tribunal as regardsadvertisement has not been complied with, the Tribunal has an option(i) either to dismiss the petition; or (ii) to give such further directionsas it may think fit \u2013 Sub-rule (6) of r.35 confers power upon theTribunal even to dispense with any advertisement \u2013 Thus, what wasnot specifically available in black and white, under the 1956statutory regime, namely the power to dispense with anyadvertisement, is now made available specifically under the statutoryregime of 2013 \u2013 In the case at hand, the company in liquidationdid not have any creditors or customers who had dealings with thecompany \u2013 There were no stakeholders prejudiced by failure ofNCLT to order publication of advertisement of the petition \u2013 Thiswas not a case where the company was sought to be wound up onground of inability to pay debts or on just and equitable ground \u2013This was a case of fraud and all stakeholders were fully aware ofthe winding up proceedings \u2013 Therefore, failure of the Tribunal toorder publication of an advertisement did not render the entireproceedings unlawful \u2013 Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.271(c) and 468 \u2013Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 Companies (Winding

Challenged, for being barredby limitation \u2013 Held: Limitation is not always akin to a lightedmatchstick to a train of gun powder \u2013 The date of commencementof the period need not necessarily be static \u2013 The date ofcommencement may keep changing depending upon the acts ofomission and commission on the part of the party against whom theaction is initiated \u2013 If the conduct of the affairs of the company ina fraudulent manner is a continuing process, the right to applybecomes recurring \u2013 In the case at hand, fraud and corruptionwere discovered only later and by the time the discovery was made,the attempts to reap the fruits of fraud had reached the pinnacle \u2013These attempts continue even till date and this falls squarely withins.271(c) \u2013 Therefore, the contention that the petition was barred bylimitation was rightly rejected by the Tribunal \u2013 Companies Act,2013.Company Law \u2013 Winding up of a company \u2013 Fraud as aground for winding up \u2013 Petition under s.271(c) of the CompaniesAct, 2013 \u2013 Challenge to \u2013 On ground of estoppel from pleadingfraud and seeking winding up \u2013 Held: In the case at hand, whatwas alleged in the petition for winding up were, (i) formation of thecompany for fraudulent or unlawful purpose; (ii) fraud in theconduct of the affairs of the company; and (iii) fraud on the part ofthe persons who were involved in the formation and/or in themanagement of affairs of the company \u2013 The fraud relatable to theagreement in question, was only one facet of the whole scheme ofthings \u2013 What is covered by s.271(c) of the Companies Act, 2013 isa fraud that goes beyond what lies in the realm of contract or in therealm of the penal provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 Hencethe contention of estoppel from pleading fraud, was rightly rejectedby the Tribunal \u2013 Companies Act, 2013 \u2013 s.271(c).Company Law \u2013 Winding up of a company \u2013 Fraud as aground for winding up \u2013 Petition under s.271(c) of the CompaniesAct, 2013 \u2013 Order of winding up passed by Tribunal \u2013 Challenge to\u2013 On ground of violation of the principles of natural justice due todenial of permission for cross examination \u2013 Tribunal justified itsaction of omission to permit cross-examination holding that the casedid not require any oral evidence \u2013 Held, on facts, the Tribunal wasright in rejecting the request for cross-examination \u2013 A party allegingthe non-existence of something, cannot be called upon to prove thenon-existence \u2013 It is the party who asserts the existence or whochallenges the assertion of non existence, who is liable to prove theexistence of the same \u2013 In the case on hand, Antrix asserted thatDevas offered services which were non-existent, through a devicewhich was not available and that even the so-called intellectualproperty rights over the device were not available \u2013 Therefore, Antrixcannot lead evidence to show the non-existence or non-availabilityof those things, either by oral evidence or by subjecting their officialsto cross-examination by Devas \u2013 Devas never produced before theTribunals any device nor did they demonstrate the availability toDevas services \u2013 All that Devas wanted was, the cross-examinationof the officials of Antrix \u2013 Any amount of cross-examination of theofficials of Antrix could not have established the existence ofsomething that was disputed by Antrix \u2013 Also, it is clear from thetime-line of events that the application for cross-examination wasmoved by Devas after conclusion of the arguments on the side ofAntrix in the main petition itself, and that too after the unsuccessfulattempt made by one of its shareholders to assail the constitutionalvalidity of the statutory provisions \u2013 Therefore, the Tribunal wasright in rejecting the request for cross-examination.Company Law \u2013 Winding up of a company \u2013 Fraud as aground for winding up \u2013 Petition under s.271(c) of the CompaniesAct, 2013 \u2013 Locus standi of the shareholders \u2013 Held: There is noscope either in the Act or in the Rules for impleadment of anyshareholder as a respondent to the winding up petition \u2013 Theobjecting shareholders had an effective hearing before NCLT \u2013Though their appeal was rejected by NCLAT on ground ofmaintainability, their arguments for opposing the winding up, whichwere just the same as that of the company, had been considered \u2013Therefore, the objection that opportunity was not given to theshareholders, is just theoretical, when in fact they were heard \u2013Companies (Winding Up) Rules, 2020 \u2013 r.3(1) \u2013 Companies Act,2013.Company Law \u2013 Winding up of a company \u2013

defined to mean all parts of \u2018opium poppy\u2019 exceptthe seeds \u2013 \u2018Opium poppy\u2019 defined under Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the1985 Act \u2013 As per sub-clause (a) of Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985Act, \u2018opium poppy\u2019 means the plant of the species \u2018papaversomniferum L\u2019 \u2013 As per sub-clause (b) thereof, \u2018opium poppy\u2019 wouldalso mean the plant of any other species of \u2018papaver\u2019 from which\u2018opium\u2019 or any \u2018phenanthrene alkaloid\u2019 can be extracted and whichthe Central Government, by notification in the official gazette, hasdeclared to be \u2018opium poppy\u2019 for the purposes of the 1985 Act \u2013Whether it is sufficient for the prosecution to establish that the rawmaterial contains \u2018morphine\u2019 and \u2018meconic acid\u2019 to bring it undersub-clause (a) of Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the Act or is it necessary forthe prosecution to further establish that, though the seized materialcontains \u2018morphine\u2019 and \u2018meconic acid\u2019, the genus of the seizedmaterial is \u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019 or any other species of \u2018papaver\u2019from which \u2018opium\u2019 or any \u2018phenanthrene alkaloid\u2019 can be extractedand which is notified in the Official Gazette by the CentralGovernment to be \u2018opium poppy\u2019 for the purposes of the 1985 Act \u2013High Court was of the opinion that the tests conducted by theChemical Examiner to ascertain whether \u2018meconic acid\u2019 and\u2018morphine\u2019 were present in the sample stuff, were not enough toreach the conclusion that the stuff was, in fact, \u2018poppy straw\u2019 \u2013Held: Prior to enactment of the 1985 Act, it was only the plant\u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019 which was included in the definition of 1878and 1930 enactments \u2013 By virtue of sub-clause (a) of Clause (xvii)of Section 2 of the 1985 Act, the same has been retained \u2013 However,noticing that there was some material to show that some other speciesof \u2018papaver\u2019 may also be used for the production of \u2018opium\u2019, thelegislature, by an abundant precaution, also added sub-clause (b)in Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985 Act so as to enable the CentralGovernment to notify such a species from which \u2018opium\u2019 or any\u2018phenanthrene alkaloid\u2019 can be extracted \u2013 The legislative intent isclear that the 1985 Act, in addition to retaining the species of\u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019 in the definition of \u2018opium poppy\u2019, enabledthe Central Government to include any other species of \u2018papaver\u2019from which \u2018opium\u2019 or any \u2018phenanthrene alkaloid\u2019 could beextracted \u2013 The legislative intent is to bring any other species of\u2018papaver\u2019 which can be used for manufacture of \u2018opium\u2019 within theprohibitory and regulatory provisions of the 1985 Act \u2013 Once it isestablished that the seized material contains \u2018meconic acid\u2019 and\u2018morphine\u2019, it will be sufficient to establish that it is derived fromthe plant \u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019 as defined in sub-clause (a) ofClause (xvii) of Section 2 of the 1985 Act \u2013 Once a ChemicalExaminer establishes that the seized \u2018poppy straw\u2019 indicates apositive test for the contents of \u2018morphine\u2019 and \u2018meconic acid\u2019, it issufficient to establish that it is covered by subclause (a) of Clause(xvii) of Section 2 of the 1985 Act and no further test would benecessary for establishing that the seized material is a part of\u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019.Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Heydon\u2019s/Mischief Rule \u2013 Meaningof \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Four factors to be considered while applying therule (i) position before enactment of the Act (ii) mischief and defectsfor which the earlier enactments did not provide (iii) remedy (iv)reason of the remedy \u2013 Held: Legislature by incorporating sub-clause (a) in Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985 Act, intended to continue\u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019 in the definition of \u2018opium poppy\u2019 \u2013 However,by taking abundant precautions and to take care of a situationwhere any other species of \u2018papaver\u2019 was found to be used for theproduction of \u2018opium\u2019, the legislature vested the Central Governmentwith a power to include such a variety to mean \u2018opium poppy\u2019 forthe purpose of the 1985 Act \u2013 The defect noticed by the legislaturewas that, though \u2018papaver somniferum L\u2019, which contained\u2018morphine\u2019 and \u2018meconic acid\u2019 and was used for the production of\u2018opium\u2019, was already included in the definition of \u2018opium\u2019 in theearlier enactments, there was also a possibility of other variety of\u2018papaver\u2019 being used for \u2018opium\u2019 production, but could not bebrought under the prohibitory and regulatory measures \u2013 The remedy,which the Parliament provided was by way of incorporating sub-clause (b) in Clause (xvii) of s.2 of the 1985 Act thereby empoweringthe Central Government to notify any other species of \u2018papaver\u2019from which \u2018opium\u2019 or any other \u2018phenanthrene alkaloid\u2019 could beextracted, to be declared as \u2018opium poppy\u2019 for the purpose of the1985 Act \u2013 The true reason for the remedy was to empower theCentral Government to include any other species of \u2018papaver\u2019 whichmay be used for the production of \u2018opium\u2019 and bring the same underthe purview of the 1985 Act \u2013 The reason was that, if it is found thatany species of \u2018papaver\u2019 is being used for the production of \u2018opium\u2019,the production of such a variety should not be permitted and thesame be brought under the prohibitory and regulatory measures asprovided under the 1985 Act \u2013 Narcotic Drugs and PsychotropicSubstances Act, 1985 \u2013 s.2(xvii) (a) and (b) \u2013Opium Act,1878 \u2013Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930. AInterpretation of Statutes \u2013 Purposive interpretation \u2013Principles of \u2013 Held: Settled principle of law that an enactment hasto be incorporated in such a manner which advances the purposeof the Act rather than interpreting in such a manner which defeatsthe purpose of the Act \u2013 The dominant purpose of the Act, 1985was to curb the menace of trafficking of drugs and psychotropicsubstances \u2013 Therefore, the interpretation which advances thepurpose of the Act, 1985 has to be preferred rather than adoptinga pedantic and a mechanical approach \u2013 Narcotic Drugs andPsychotropic Substances Act, 1985"

UNION OF INDIA & ORS.was only clarificatory in view of the earlier observations in BuddhiPrakash Sharma \u2013 Interpreting the order to mean that the Union ofIndia sought the permission of Supreme Court before providingreservation would amount to aiding an interpretation that wouldfoster judicial overreach \u2013 The Union Government was not requiredto seek the permission of the Court before providing reservation inAIQ seats \u2013 Providing reservation in the AIQ seats is a policy decisionof the Government.Constitution of India \u2013 Reservation \u2013 All-India Quota (AIQ)seats \u2013 Impugned notice providing reservation for OBC and EWScategories in the AIQ was issued on 29 July 2021, after theregistration for the examination had closed on 18 April 2021 \u2013Plea of the petitioners that the rules of the examination could haveonly been changed before the last date for registration and as thecandidates registered for the exam having a particular seat matrixin mind, the change in the seat matrix after registration would bearbitrary \u2013 Held: Clause 11 of the information bulletin specifiesthat the reservation applicable to NEET-PG would be notified bythe counselling authority before the beginning of the counsellingprocess \u2013 Therefore, the candidates while applying for NEET-PGare not provided any information on the distribution of seat matrix\u2013 Such information is provided by the counselling authority onlybefore the counselling session is to begin \u2013 It thus cannot be arguedthat the rules of the game were set when the registration for theexamination closed.Constitution of India \u2013 Reservation \u2013 The Constitution (OneHundred and Third Amendment) Act 2019 \u2013 Articles 15(6) and 16(6)\u2013 Criteria for the determination of the EWS for the ten percentreservation \u2013 Challenge to \u2013 Held: Challenge to the very criteriafor the determination of the EWS would not only require the matterto be heard at length but also to hear all interested parties \u2013 However,in view of the delay in the counselling process due to the pendencyof this petition, it is deemed necessary to allow the counsellingsession to begin with the existing criteria for the identification ofthe EWS category \u2013 Judicial propriety does not permit to pass aninterim order staying the criteria for determination of the EWScategory \u2013 It is a settled principle of law that in matters involvingchallenge to the constitutionality of a legislation or a rule, the Courtmust be wary to pass an interim order, unless the Court is convincedthat the rules are prima facie arbitrary \u2013 However, at this stage,without hearing all the interested parties at length on arguments, itwould be impermissible to form a prima facie opinion on the allegedarbitrariness of the criteria \u2013 Further, in the midst of the pandemic,any delay in the recruitment of doctors would impact the ability tomanage the pandemic \u2013 Hence, it is necessary to avoid any furtherdelays in the admission process and allow counselling to beginimmediately \u2013 The implementation of EWS reservation in AIQ seatsin NEET UG and PG seats for the academic year of 2021-2022 isallowed \u2013 EWS category be identified in view of the criteria in O.MNo. 36039/1/2019 \u2013 Challenge to the validity of the criteriadetermined by the Pandey Committee for the identification of theEWS category be listed for final hearing."
