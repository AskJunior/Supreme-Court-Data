        "HeadNote": " Penal Code, 1860: ss.302, 364 \u2013 Murder of three minor children \u2013 Case based on circumstantial evidence \u2013 Prosecution case was that the complainant lodged missing report of his three minor children aged about 8 years, 6 years and 4 years respectively \u2013 During search, PW-8 stated that he saw the minor children along with the appellant near their school \u2013 Appellant was not found in his house and was missing even from the village \u2013 Thereafter appellant was contacted on his mobile and he told that he was 60 Kms away \u2013 Police traced the location of mobile and found him in the house of PW-13 \u2013 At the instance of appellant, dead bodies along with the school bags were recovered \u2013 Conviction by courts below \u2013 Held: Prosecution was able to prove beyond doubt that all the three minors went to the school in the morning and thereafter they left for the home at about 11.30 hours \u2013 That, thereafter, at about 12.00 hours, the appellant was seen with all the three minor children \u2013 There was a prior enmity between the appellant and the complainant father of the deceased minor children as the wife of the accused had eloped with the brother of the complainant-father and the children of the accused were without their mother \u2013 Immediately after his arrest, the dead bodies were recovered/found along with the school bags etc. from the place shown by the accused himself \u2013 The phone-calls made to the accused was established and proved by the prosecution by examining the Investigating Officer and by producing the call details from the mobile company \u2013 These chain of events led to the conclusion that the accused first kidnapped the three minor children and thereafter killed all of them \u2013 No interference with the order of conviction called for. Sentence/Sentencing: Death sentence \u2013 Conviction and death sentence for murder of three minor children \u2013 For deciding on the issue of sentence, the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances must be located and the right balance must be adopted \u2013 In the instant case, the mitigating factors/circumstances were that the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance \u2013 Appellant was emotionally disturbed due to the elopement of his wife with the uncle of the deceased and that his children were suffering in absence of their mother; there were no criminal antecedents; at the time of commission of the offence the appellant was 28 years of age and his conduct in prison was reported to be good; he belonged to a poor family and was the only son of his parents, and his aged mother was taking care of his daughters \u2013 On the other hand, the only aggravating circumstance pointed out by the State was the manner in which the incident took place and three minors were brutally killed \u2013 Except this, no other aggravating circumstances were pointed out on behalf of the State \u2013 Therefore, striking the balance between aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances, in the facts and circumstances of the case, more particularly, the mental condition of the appellant at the time of the commission of the offence, the mitigating circumstances are in favour of the accused to convert the death sentence to life imprisonment \u2013 Thus, the death sentence converted into the life imprisonment \u2013 It is directed that the life means till the end of the life with the further observation and direction that there shall not be any remission till the accused completes 25 years of imprisonment. Evidence: Minor discrepancies and inconsistencies in evidence \u2013 Held: The minor discrepancies and inconsistencies in the statements of the prosecution witnesses and the minor lacuna in the investigation led by the police cannot be a reason for discarding the entire prosecution case, if the evidence is otherwise sufficient and inspiring to bring home the guilt of the accused. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.235(2) \u2013 Object and purpose \u2013 Held: The object and purpose of s.235(2) is that the accused must be given an opportunity to make a representation against the sentence to be imposed on him \u2013 Sub-section (2) of s.235 satisfies a dual purpose; it satisfies the rule of natural justice by affording to the accused an opportunity of being heard on the question of sentence and at the same time helps the court to choose the sentence to be awarded \u2013 There is no absolute proposition of law that in no case there can be conviction and sentence on the same day or that if the sentence is awarded on the very same day on which the conviction was recorded, the sentencing would be vitiated.

they were manufactured wholly from the raw materials produced or manufactured in India and, allowed to be sold in India in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9.9(b) of the EXIM Policy \u2013 Thus the conditions of Notification No.21/97-C.E. were satisfied \u2013 Therefore, respondent was entitled to carry out the job work for TISCO and entitled to exemption from payment of duty \u2013 Revenue\u2019s appeal was rightly dismissed by CESTAT  Interpretation of Statutes: Excise Act \u2013 It is a settled principle in excise classification that the definition of one statute having a different object, purpose and scheme cannot be applied mechanically to another statute \u2013 It is also equally well settled that the first principle of interpretation of plain and literal interpretation has to be adhered to \u2013 Therefore, the narrower scope of the term \u2018sale\u2019 as found in the Sale of Goods Act, 1930 cannot be applied in the instant case \u2013 The term \u2018sale\u2019 and \u2018purchase\u2019 under the Central Excise Act, 1944, if construed literally, it would give a wider scope and also include transfer of possession for valuable consideration under the definition of the term \u2018sale\u2019.

Kailash Nath Kothari and held that the appellant alone is vicariously liable to pay the victim\u2019s family the amount of compensation that was ordered \u2013 On appeal, held: The judgment Kailash Nath Kothari is distinguishable since in that case the Insurance Company\u2019s liability was limited only to Rs. 75,000/- which was paid, the Insurance Company would, on the facts of that case, not liable to pay anything more and on this count, the amount payable beyond Rs. 75,000/- was mulcted on to the Corporation \u2013 In a subsequent Supreme court judgment Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation v. Kulsum and Ors. also distinguished Kailash Nath Kothari Case and held the insurance company was liable \u2013 In the said case, it was held that once the vehicle is insured, the owner as well as any other person, can use the vehicle with the consent of the owner \u2013 s. 146 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 does not provide that any person who uses the vehicle independently, a separate insurance policy should be taken \u2013 The purpose of compulsory insurance in the Act has been enacted with an object to advance social justice \u2013 In the instant case, the law down in Kulsum\u2019s Case squarely applies \u2013 Besides, the clause 10 under the agreement between the Corporation and bus owner, regarding \u2018The Second Party (Bus Owner) shall have full responsibility for any fault, negligence, accident, or other illegal acts of the driver....in case any payment is made by the First Party (Corporation) in compliance of any order of any Court etc., the First Party shall be authorised to recover the same from the Second Party \u2018 is between Corporation and the Bus owner, it does not bind anybody who is not privy to the agreement, least of all, the victim \u2013 Therefore, the sum awarded by the MACT, now only be payable by the Insurance Company with interest.

Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.48(1)(b) \u2013 Enforcement of foreign awards \u2013 Refusal at the request of party if that party furnishes to the court that he was unable to present his case \u2013 Expression \u201cwas otherwise unable to present his case\u201d \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Held: Expression \u201cwas otherwise unable to present his case\u201d occurring in s.48(1)(b) cannot be given an expansive meaning and would have to be read in the context and colour of the words preceding the said phrase \u2013 This expression would be a facet of natural justice, which would be breached only if a fair hearing was not given by the arbitrator to the parties \u2013 Read along with the first part of s.48(1)(b), this expression would apply at the hearing stage and not after the award is delivered \u2013 Such breach should be clearly made out on the facts of a given case, and that awards must always be read supportively with an inclination to uphold rather than destroy, given the minimal interference possible with foreign awards under s.48 of the Act \u2013 Mere failure to consider a material issue would not fall within the rubric of s.48(1)(b) \u2013 However, if a foreign award fails to determine a material issue which goes to the root of the matter or fails to decide a claim or counter- claim in its entirety, the award shocking the conscience of the Court may be set aside on the ground of violation of the public policy of India, in that it would then offend a most basic notion of justice in this country \u2013 Poor reasoning, by which a material issue or claim is rejected, can never fall in this class of cases \u2013 The foreign award must be read as a whole, fairly, and without nit-picking \u2013 In the instant case, when award is read as a whole, it has addressed the basic issues raised by the parties and has, in substance, decided the claims and counter-claims of the parties, its enforcement must follow. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996: s.48 \u2013 Recognition and enforcement of foreign awards \u2013 Scope of interference under Art.136 \u2013 The legislative policy so far as recognition and enforcement of foreign awards is that an appeal is provided against a judgment refusing to recognise and enforce a foreign award but not the other way around (i.e. an order recognising and enforcing an award) \u2013 This is because the policy of the legislature is that there ought to be only one bite at the cherry in a case where objections are made to the foreign award on the extremely narrow grounds contained in s.48 of the Act and which have been rejected \u2013 This is in consonance with the fact that India is a signatory to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958 (\u201cNew York Convention\u201d) and intends - through this legislation - to ensure that a person who belongs to a Convention country, and who, in most cases, has gone through a challenge procedure to the said award in the country of its origin, must then be able to get such award recognised and enforced in India as soon as possible \u2013 Bearing this in mind, the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Art.136 should not be used to circumvent the legislative policy so contained \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.136 \u2013 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958.

Pvt. Ltd. \u2013 In the said Company, 25% of the shareholding was with M.P. Recycling Company (Jointly held by plaintiffs and defendants nos. 1 to 6) and the remaining 75% of the shareholding with defendants nos. 1 to 6 in their individual capacities \u2013 According to the plaintiffs, defendants nos. 1 to 6 entered into a purported Development Agreement with defendant no. 10, to develop the disputed property behind the back of plaintiffs \u2013 As per plaintiffs, the defendants nos. 1 to 6 received Rs. 45 crores from the developer and 15 flats & 72 car parking spaces under the development agreement \u2013 According to the plaintiffs, the defendant nos. 1 to 6 did not give any rights/ benefits in the said property to them \u2013 This led to the filing of the suit \u2013 During the pendency of the suit, the suit came to be settled and it was disposed of in accordance of the consent terms \u2013 As per plaintiffs, the developer had in accordance with the consent terms executed the letter of allotment in \u2018Annexure E\u2019 in respect of the 8 apartments, which were to fall in the share of the plaintiffs, but defendant nos. 1 to 6 refused to abide by the consent terms and counter-sign the letter of allotment as per \u2018Annexure E\u2019 \u2013 The plaintiff initiated proceedings for the execution of the consent decree viz. for execution of the document at \u2018Annexure E\u2019 \u2013 The execution application was rejected by the Single Judge of the High court and it was observed that unless and until the supplementary consent terms are entered into between the parties, there is no obligation on the part of defendant nos. 1 to 6 to execute the letter of allotment in the form of \u2018Annexure E\u2019 \u2013 The Division Bench of the High Court confirmed the judgment and order passed by the Single Judge of the High Court \u2013 On appeal, held: From the consent terms, it appears that both the parties \u2013 PA Group and RA Group decided to resolve and settle the other disputes also i.e. the other larger companies and its constituents \u2013 The entire consent terms/ consent decree is required to be acted upon and/ or implemented by both the parties otherwise, the object and purpose to resolve all the disputes will be frustrated \u2013 Thus, there cannot be any execution of partial consent terms/ consent decree \u2013 Also, the further execution of supplemental consent terms/ family arrangement is required to be executed between the parties, considering the relevant terms of settlement \u2013 The both Single Judge as well the Division Bench were justified in holding that the execution of the further supplemental consent terms/ family arrangement is must \u2013 Therefore, both the parties directed to fully comply with the consent terms/ consent decree and enter into the further supplemental consent terms/ family arrangement after following the modalities with respect to valuation, bidding etc. \u2013 Also, RA Group to counter-sign \u2018Annexure E\u2019 letter with respect to 8 flats as per list at \u2018Annexure A\u2019 to the consent terms for which the developer had issued letter \u2013 However, it is further directed that till the consent terms/consent decree is fully implemented by both the parties and the supplemental consent terms/family arrangement is entered into/executed, the PA Group shall not alienate in any manner the said 8 flats.

Appointment \u2013 Illegal appointment from inception \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: An appointment which is erroneous or illegal from the very inception does not clothe the appointee with any indefeasible right and such appointment is always subject to correctional decisions \u2013 Appointment of a candidate who has erroneously secured public employment without fulfillment of minimum qualifications can always be annulled upon discovery of mistake. Legislation: Clarificatory\u2019 legislations \u2013 Connotation of \u2013 Held: Clarificatory\u2019 legislations are an exception to the general rule of presuming prospective application of laws, unless given retrospective effect either expressly or by necessary implication \u2013 In order to attract this exception, mere mention in the title or in any provision that the legislation is \u2018clarificatory\u2019 would not suffice \u2013 Instead, it must substantively be proved that the law was in fact \u2018clarificatory\u2019 \u2013 If there exists no ambiguity, there arises no question of making use of a clarificatory notification.

        "HeadNote": " Service Law \u2013 Voluntary Retirement Scheme \u2013 Whether the respondent employees are entitled to pension on completion of 15 years of service as per the State Bank of India Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS framed in 2000) \u2013 Held: The Central Board of Directors of the SBI accepted the memorandum for making payment of pension, in case it was not accepting the proposal, in the memorandum it ought to have said clearly that it was not ready to accept the proposals of the Government and the Indian Bank Association (IBA) and rejects the same \u2013 However, once it approved the proposals referred to in the memorandum which were on the basis of IBA\u2019s letter and Government of India\u2019s decision it was bound to implement it in true letter and spirit \u2013 By accepting the same, binding obligation was created upon the SBI to make payment of pension on completion of 15 years of service \u2013 It cannot invalidate its own decision by relying on fact it failed to amend the rule, whereas other Banks did it later on with the retrospective effect \u2013 They cannot invalidate otherwise valid decision by virtue of exclusive superior power to amend or not to amend the rule and act unfairly and make the entire contract unreasonable based on misrepresentation \u2013 The scheme of contractual nature has to be read in the context and in the backdrop of facts and what has been resolved by the Board of Directors \u2013 There is no ambiguity with respect to the admissibility of pension when the memorandum and the scheme are read together \u2013 In case of ambiguity and even if two interpretations are possible in the backdrop of facts of the case, one in favour of the employee has to be adopted and any clarification, if it denies the benefit of pension, has to be held to be unenforceable, illegal and contrary to law \u2013 In the instant case, the eligibility clause, when read with clauses providing the benefit, i.e., clauses 5 and 6 of the scheme, leaves no room for any doubt and makes it clear the employee with 15 years of service were treated as eligible to claim the benefit of the scheme floated by SBI \u2013 Therefore, the employees who completed 15 years of service or more as on cut-off date were entitled to proportionate pension under SBI-VRS to be computed as per SBI Pension Fund Rules "

        "HeadNote": " Service Law: Judicial service \u2013 Allegation against appellant judicial officer that while posted as ADJ, she had decided the land acquisition reference illegally and against all judicial norms and propriety awarding to the claimants the amount of compensation at an unduly high rate which led to inference that she was actuated by extraneous considerations and thereby failed to maintain absolute integrity and complete devotion of duty and committed misconduct under U.P. Government Servants\u2019 Conduct Rules, 1956 \u2013 Enquiry Committee held that the charges were proved for, the errors were apparent in both cases which were such shocking blunders that they could not be attributed to mere misjudgment and consequently were proved to be deliberate \u2013 Accordingly, order of dismissal from service passed \u2013 Appellant unsuccessfully challenged the order of dismissal before High Court \u2013 On appeal, held: It is the decision making process of delinquent officer and not the end result of the judicial process which could be subjected to disciplinary action \u2013 It is a matter of record that at the time when the High Court was seized of this matter, writ petitions against both of the appellant\u2019s land acquisition judgments were dismissed by its coordinate benches \u2013 High Court nevertheless, rightly observed that dismissal of writ petitions against the appellant\u2019s orders did not serve as vindication or confirmation of her orders \u2013 Indeed, as correctly noted by the High Court, the scope of judicial review under Art.226 is limited \u2013 The standards to be met prior to interference in exercise of writ jurisdiction are very high, and there needs to be gross substantive injustice through the conclusion, glaring irregularities in procedure or the need to resolve important questions of law for a writ court to overturn the Reference Court\u2019s order \u2013 Hence, dismissal of writ petition merely signifies the failure to demonstrate any of these high standards, in a particular case, and not the endorsement of the orders passed by a subordinate authority \u2013 However, the facts of the instant case are distinct \u2013 This Court, in fact, entered into the merits of one of the allegedly erroneous orders \u2013 Not only was the judgment affirmed, but rather the compensation was further enhanced \u2013 It, therefore, can no longer be stated that the appellant\u2019s order was wrong in conclusion \u2013 This fact is significant as it establishes that the increase in compensation by the appellant was not abhorrent \u2013 There is no explicit mention of any extraneous consideration being actually received or of unbecoming conduct on the part of the appellant \u2013 Instead, the very basis of the finding of \u2018misbehaviour\u2019 is the end result itself, which as per the High Court was so shocking that it gave rise to a natural suspicion as to the integrity and honesty of the appellant \u2013 Although this might be right in a vacuum, however, given how the end result itself has been untouched by superior courts and instead in one of the two cases, the compensation only increased, no such inference can be made \u2013 Thus, case against the appellant not made out \u2013 Order of dismissal set aside \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.226 \u2013 Judicial service. Judicial Officers: Judicial officers must aspire and adhere to a higher standard of honesty, integrity and probity \u2013 Also mere suspicion cannot constitute \u2018misconduct\u2019 \u2013 Any \u2018probability\u2019 of misconduct needs to be supported with oral or documentary material, even though the standard of proof would obviously not be at par with that in a criminal trial "

Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010: ss.5(1) and 5(4) \u2013 Constitutional validity of \u2013 The power conferred by the Act on the Central Government to declare an organisation to be an organisation of a political nature u/s.5(1) of the Act was challenged by the Appellant on the ground that no guidelines are provided for the exercise of such power \u2013 s.5(4) of the Act was assailed on the ground that the authority to which a representation made by the aggrieved party is to be forwarded, has not been specified \u2013 Held: s.5(1) does not suffer from the vice of vagueness inviting the wrath of Art. 14 \u2013 s.5(4) cannot be declared as unconstitutional only on the ground that the authority to whom representation should be made is not specified \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 19(1)(a), 19(1)(c) and 21. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011: rr.3(i), 3(v) and 3(vi) \u2013 Constitutional validity of \u2013 According to the Appellant, the guidelines provided in r.3 of the Rules are impermissibly wide, giving arbitrary discretion to the authorities which would result in abuse of the power \u2013 It was alleged in the Writ Petition that the Rules suffer from unreasonableness and arbitrariness \u2013 Appellant prayed for declaring rr.3(i), 3(v) and 3(vi) as violative of the fundamental rights enshrined in Arts.14, 19(1)(a), 19(1)(c) and 21 of the Constitution \u2013 Held: According to r.3(i), an organisation having avowed political objectives in its memorandum of association or bye laws is an organisation of a political nature \u2013 As the intention of the legislature is to prohibit foreign funds in active politics, an Association with avowed political objectives (i.e. to play a role in active politics or party politics) cannot be permitted access to foreign funds \u2013 There is no ambiguity in the provision and hence, cannot be termed as vague \u2013 r.3 (i) is not ultra vires the Act \u2013 r.3 (v) deals with organisations of farmers, workers, students etc. which are not directly aligned to any political party but objectives of which include steps towards advancement of \u2018political interests\u2019 of such groups \u2013 Prohibition from receiving foreign aid, either directly or indirectly, by those who are involved in active politics is to ensure that the values of a sovereign democratic republic are protected \u2013 On the other hand, such of those voluntary organisations which have absolutely no connection with either party politics or active politics cannot be denied access to foreign contributions \u2013 Therefore, such of those organisations which are working for the social and economic welfare of the society cannot be brought within the purview of the Act or the Rules by enlarging the scope of the term \u2018political interests\u2019 \u2013 The expression \u2018political interests\u2019 in r.3 (v) has to be construed to be in connection with active politics or party politics \u2013 Any organisation which habitually engages itself in or employs common methods of political action like \u2018bandh\u2019 or \u2018hartal\u2019, \u2018rasta roko\u2019, \u2018rail roko\u2019 or \u2018jail bharo\u2019 in support of public causes can also be declared as an organisation of political nature, according to the guideline prescribed in r.3 (vi) \u2013 Support to public causes by resorting to legitimate means of dissent like bandh, hartal etc. cannot deprive an organisation of its legitimate right of receiving foreign contribution \u2013 It is clear from the provision itself that bandh, hartal, rasta roko etc., are treated as common methods of political action \u2013 Any organisation which supports the cause of a group of citizens agitating for their rights without a political goal or objective cannot be penalized by being declared as an organisation of a political nature \u2013 To save this provision from being declared as unconstitutional, it is held that it is only those organisations which have connection with active politics or take part in party politics, that are covered by r.3 (vi). Interpretation of Statutes: Two interpretations \u2013 Held: In case of ambiguity in the language used in the provision of a statute, the Courts can take aid from the historical background, the Parliamentary debates and the aims and objects of the Act \u2013 Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Rules, 2011.

        "HeadNote": " Judicial Service \u2013 Probation period \u2013 Order of nonconfirmation in \u2013 Respondent no.1 \u2013 a former Judicial Officer was appointed as a Civil Judge (Junior Division)-cum- Judicial Magistrate and he was placed on probation for a period of two years \u2013 There were certain allegations of 7 and corruption in discharge of judicial functions during the probation period against respondent no.1 \u2013 On basis of which the Registrar of Vigilance was called and he submitted a report \u2013 The Administration Committee of the High Court did not confirm the service of respondent no.1 \u2013 The Full Court of the High Court confirmed the recommendations \u2013 Consequently, on basis of the recommendation of the High Court the State government dispensed with the services of respondent no.1 \u2013 Writ Petition by respondent no.1 \u2013 The Division Bench of the High Court quashed the termination order and directed reinstatement of respondent no. 1 \u2013 Before the Supreme Court, the respondent no. 1 contended that it was a case of an indictment following allegations of corruption against him \u2013 On appeal, held: The entire object of probation is to provide the employer an opportunity to evaluate the probationer\u2019s performance and test his suitability for a particular post \u2013 The true test of suitability is actual performance of duties which can only be applied after the candidate joins and starts working \u2013 In the instant case, the order of termination of services of respondent no. 1 is based upon overall assessment of performance of respondent no. 1 during the period of probation, which was not found satisfactory \u2013 Such an inference which can be valid foundation to dispense with services of a probationer does not warrant holding of an enquiry in terms of Art. 311 of the Constitution \u2013 It is thus not true on part of respondent no. 1 to allege that it was a case of an indictment following allegations of corruption against him \u2013 There is nothing in the present case to infer that the motivation behind the removal was any allegation \u2013 Instead, it was a routine confirmation exercise \u2013 The foundation for removal was not the allegations but it was a holistic assessment of respondent\u2019s service record \u2013 Therefore, the judgment of the High Court set aside. Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 226 \u2013 Judicial review by the High Court over the decision taken by its Full Court on administrative side \u2013 Held: Although it would be a futile task to exhaustively delineate the scope of writ jurisdiction in such matters but a High Court u/Art. 226 has limited scope and it ought to interfere cautiously \u2013 The amplitude of such jurisdiction cannot be enlarged to sit as an \u2018appellate authority\u2019, and hence care must be taken to not hold another possible interpretation on the same set of material or substitute the Court\u2019s opinion for that of the disciplinary authority \u2013 This is especially true given the responsibility and powers bestowed upon the High Court u/Art.235 of the Constitution \u2013 The collective wisdom of the Full Court deserves due respect, weightage and consideration in the process of judicial review. Service Law \u2013 Difference between the termination of a probationer and of a confirmed employee \u2013 Held: There is a subtle, yet fundamental, difference between termination of a probationer and that of a confirmed employee \u2013 Although it is undisputed that the State cannot act arbitrarily in either case, yet there has to be a difference in judicial approach between the two \u2013 Whereas in the case of a confirmed employee the scope of judicial interference would be more expansive given the protection u/Art. 311 of the Constitution or the Service Rules but such may not be true in the case of probationers who are denuded of such protection(s) while working on trial basis \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 311. Service Law \u2013 Right to continue in the employment of probationers \u2013 Held: Probationers have no indefeasible right to continue in employment until confirmed, and they can be relieved by the competent authority if found unsuitable \u2013 It is only in a very limited category of cases that such probationers can seek protection under the principles of natural justice, say when they are \u2018removed\u2019 in a manner which prejudices their future prospects in alternate fields or casts aspersions on their character or violates their constitutional rights \u2013 In such cases of \u2018stigmatic\u2019 removal only a reasonable opportunity of hearing is sine-qua-non.

        "HeadNote": " Land Acquisition Act, 1894 \u2013 Land given on lease for 20 years to the defendant with a clause that plaintiff-lessor could seek ejectment of the defendant-lessee from the leased premises, only in case the rent for one year remained in arrear \u2013 After six years, entire leased land acquired under s.4 of the Land Acquisition Act \u2013 Land Acquisition Collector determined market value of the acquired land \u2013 Dispute with regard to apportionment of compensation referred to the Reference Court \u2013 Lessee claimed share in the compensation on the ground that they were deprived of the right to retain possession of leased land for the unexpired period of 14 years of the lease in their favour \u2013 Reference court held that the lessee had not paid rent for more than 12 months and, thus, in accordance with clause 9 of the lease deed, the lease had come to an end and therefore, the lessee had no right to claim a share in the compensation payable for the land leased to them \u2013 After about two years, a part of the land acquired stood de-notified and the said land continued to be in possession of the lessee \u2013 Thereafter, the lessor filed suit for possession of the said land i.e. the land leased that continued in possession with the lessee post the de-notification \u2013 Trial court decreed the suit \u2013 In appeal against the said judgment, the lessee sought amendment of his written statement asserting that the suit was barred by limitation under Art. 66 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act \u2013 First Appellate Court did not permit the lessee to amend the written statement but the question of limitation was allowed to be raised on the basis of material available on record \u2013 First Appellate Court did not find any merit in the argument raised by the lessee that the award passed by the Reference Court operated as res judicata \u2013 First Appellate Court found that the plea of forfeiture was totally inconsistent and contradictory to the averments made in the original statement \u2013 High Court allowed the second appeal filed by lessee holding that the finding recorded in the award that upon non-payment of rent for 12 months, the lease had come to an end, had attained finality \u2013 Therefore, such finding would operate as res judicata \u2013 High Court further held that period of limitation under Art.67 of the Limitation Act is 12 years, the period for which commences from the date when the tenancy is determined and since the tenancy was determined in 1960, the suit filed in 1981 was beyond the period of limitation \u2013 Hence instant appeal \u2013 Held: The issue in the proceedings under s.30 of the Act, before the Reference Court was restricted to the apportionment of compensation, consequent to the acquisition of the leased land \u2013 The issue was restricted to the payment of compensation on account of the unexpired period of lease and issue was not the title of the lessor or the eviction of the lessee \u2013 Before the award was announced by the Reference Court, part of the land acquired was de-notified \u2013 After denotification of the land, the lessee continued to be in possession and the title of the lessor as owners stood restored \u2013 De-notification under s.48 of the Act is possible only when possession has not been taken and the land has not been vested in the State \u2013 Once the land was de-notified, the status of the parties as they existed prior to s.4 notification stood revived \u2013 Finding returned in the award of the Reference Court that the lease stood determined on account of non-payment of rent was a finding made by the Reference Court for a limited purpose i.e. not to accept the lessee\u2019s claim for compensation \u2013 Such finding cannot be binding on the parties in a suit for possession based on title or as a lessor against a lessee \u2013 Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 Art.67.  Limitation Act, 1963: Art.67 \u2013 Suit filed within 12 years of the determination of the tenancy by efflux of time \u2013 The defendant has not proved forfeiture of tenancy prior to the expiry of lease period \u2013 Mere non-payment of rent does not amount to forfeiture of tenancy \u2013 It only confers a right on the landlord to seek possession \u2013 The plaintiffs filed a suit for possession against the defendant on the basis of determination of tenancy, such suit is governed by Art.67 alone \u2013 In view of this, the suit for possession would not be covered by Art.65 since there is a specific article i.e. Art.67 dealing with right of the lessor to claim possession after determination of tenancy \u2013 The appellants-plaintiffs claimed possession from the defendant alleging him to be the tenant and that he had not handed over the leased property after determination of the lease \u2013 Therefore, such suit would fall within Art.67 of the Limitation Act \u2013 Such suit having been filed within 12 years of the determination of lease by efflux of time, the same is within the period of limitation. Res Judicata: s.11 of the Code bars the subsequent Court to try any suit or issue which has been directly and substantially issue in a former suit \u2013 The issue before the Reference Court was apportionment of compensation and such issue having been decided against the defendant, the reference to notice for termination of tenancy does not operate as res judicata \u2013 Therefore, the finding recorded by the High Court that the order of the Reference Court operated as res judicata was clearly not sustainable \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 s.11. Lease: Status of tenant \u2013 Tenant at sufferance or tenant holding over \u2013 The defendant was inducted as a lessee for a period of 20 years \u2013 The lessor had a right to seek possession in terms of clause 9 of the lease deed \u2013 The mere fact that the lessor had not chosen to exercise that right will not foreclose the rights of the lessor as owner of the property leased \u2013 After the expiry of lease period, and in the absence of payment of rent by the lessee, the status of the lessee will be that of tenant at sufferance and not a tenant holding over \u2013 s.116 of the TP Act confers the status of a tenant holding over on a yearly or monthly basis keeping in view the purpose of the lease, only if the lessor accepts the payment of lease money \u2013 If the lessor does not accept the lease money, the status of the lessee would be that of tenant at sufferance. Estoppel: When lessee continued to be in possession of the land leased by way of registered lease deed and admitted the ownership of the lessor before the Reference Court, it operates as estoppel against the lessee in respect of the title of the lessor. Adverse Possession: Respondent claimed adverse possession and claimed possession as owner against a person, who has inducted him as tenant \u2013 The respondent was to prove his continuous, open and hostile possession to the knowledge of true owner for a continuous period of 12 years \u2013 The respondent has not led any evidence of hostile possession to the knowledge of true owner at any time before or after the award of the reference Court nor he has surrendered possession before asserting hostile, continuous and open title to the knowledge of the true owner \u2013 The question of adverse possession without admitting the title of the real owner is not tenable.

Constitution of India: Art.285(2) \u2013 Levy of tax on any property of Union \u2013 Object of Art.285(2) \u2013 Held: Object of Art.285(2) is to continue the levy of the such tax which local authority was enjoying prior to the commencement of the Constitution so as to maintain the status quo regarding the financial resources of Municipal Corporation to avoid the complete exemption from property of Central Government as provided under Art.285(1) \u2013 Tax/Taxation.
