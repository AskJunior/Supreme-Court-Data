they confer benefits based on theantecedent event, and the Mitakshara coparcenary law shall bedeemed to include a reference to a daughter as a coparcener \u2013 Aretroactive statute is the one that does not operate retrospectively \u2013It operates in futuro \u2013 However, its operation is based upon thecharacter or status that arose earlier \u2013 Characteristic or event whichhappened in the past or requisites which had been drawn fromantecedent events \u2013 Under the amended s.6, since the right is givenby birth, that is an antecedent event, and the provisions operateconcerning claiming rights on and from the date of Amendment Act.Hindu Succession Act, 1956 \u2013 s.6 as amended by HinduSuccession (Amendment) Act, 2005 \u2013 Obstructed and unobstructedheritage \u2013 Unobstructed heritage takes place by birth, and theobstructed heritage takes place after the death of the owner \u2013 It issignificant to note that u/s. 6 by birth, right is given that is calledunobstructed heritage \u2013 It is not the obstructed heritage dependingupon the owner\u2019s death \u2013 Thus, coparcener father need not be aliveon 09.09.2005, date of substitution of provisions of s.6."
