Consumer Protection \u2013 Insurance \u2013 Contract of Insurance \u2013 \u2018Own damage\u2019 - Clause extricating the Insurer on the basis of the driver being under the influence of alcohol \u2013 Contrasting Models\u2013 Held: One of the models is represented by American cases where all that required is that the person has in his body alcohol in any degree \u2013 Under this model, it need not influence his conduct \u2013 Under the other model the insurer must show that the person driving the vehicle was under the influence of liquor.Insurance \u2013 Contract of Insurance \u2013 Drunken driving \u2013 Liability of insurer excluded \u2013 Exclusion Clause \u2013 \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d \u2013 Interpretation of \u2013 Held: Mere presence of alcohol in any small degree would not be sufficient \u2013 Court cannot re-write the contract and hold that the mere presence of the alcohol, in the slightest degree, is sufficient to exclude the liability of the insurer \u2013 It requires something more, namely, that the driver of the vehicle was at the time of the accident acting under the influence of intoxicating liquor.Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 s.185 \u2013 Blood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) \u2013 Permissible level; variables correlated to \u2013 Discussed. Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 s.106 \u2013 Facts specially within the knowledge of person \u2013 Burden of proof \u2013 Drunken driving \u2013 Car completely damaged in accident \u2013As per the respondent-insured the driver had not consumed any alcohol \u2013 In the very next sentence, it was pleaded that assuming that he had consumed alcohol, as he was not intoxicated the exclusion clause is not attracted \u2013 Held: Driver did not depose that he had not consumed intoxicating liquor \u2013 He only stated that he was neither under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs at the time of the accident \u2013 Car was driven by the driver after having consumed alcohol \u2013 In such a case as to what was the nature of the alcohol and what was the quantity of alcohol consumed, and where he had consumed, would certainly be facts within the special knowledge of the person who has consumed the alcohol \u2013 Thus, it would be \u201cdisproportionately difficult\u201d for the insurer in the facts to prove as to whether the driver has consumed liquor on an empty stomach or he had food and then consumed alcohol or what was the quantity and quality of the drink (alcohol content), circumstances relevant to consider as to whether he drove the vehicle under the influence of alcohol \u2013 Even if, the Section as such is not applicable to the Consumer Protection Act, the principle can apply to proceedings under the Consumer Protection Act.Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 s.185 \u2013 Road Traffic Act, 1988 \u2013 ss.3A, 4, 5, 6B \u2013 Comparison between \u2013 Discussed. Doctrines/Principles \u2013 res ipsa loquitur \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Drunken driving \u2013 State Commission applied the principle of res ipsa loquitur\u2013 Held: res ipsa loquitur is used in cases of tort and where the facts without anything more clearly and unerringly point to negligence \u2013 Principle of res ipsa loquitur, as such, appears to be inapposite, when, what is in question, is whether driver was under the influence of alcohol \u2013 Though the principle as such is inapplicable, the manner in which the accident occurred may along with other circumstances point to the driver being under the influence of alcohol. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 s.185 \u2013 Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 \u2013 s.117 \u2013 Differences between \u2013 Discussed. Consumer Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 Enquiry \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: Scope of the enquiry, in a case under the Consumer Protection Act, which is a summary proceeding, cannot be lost sight of \u2013 A consumer, under the Act, can succeed, only on the basis of proved deficiency of service which would arise only with reference to the terms of the contract and the law which surrounds it \u2013 If the deficiency is not established, having regard to the explicit terms of the contract, the consumer must fail. Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 ss.185, 203, 204 \u2013 Consumer Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 Held: Requirement of s.185 is in the context of a criminal offence \u2013 If there is a conviction u/s.185, it would fortify the Insurer in successfully invoking Exclusion Clause \u2013 However, if prosecution has not filed a case u/s.185, that would not mean that a competent Forum in an action alleging deficiency of service, under the Consumer Protection Act, is disabled from finding that the vehicle was being driven by the person under the influence of the alcohol. Road Traffic Act, 1988 \u2013 ss.3A, 4, 5, 6B \u2013 Impairment Test \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 s.185. Insurance \u2013 Drunken driving \u2013Exclusion Clause \u2013Liability of insurer excluded \u2013Held: It is not necessary for the Insurer to establish that there was acute alcohol intoxication or that the vehicle was driven by a person who was a chronic alcoholic \u2013 All that is required is to show that at the time of driving the vehicle, resulting in the accident, the driver was under the influence of alcohol \u2013Scientific aspects about alcohol discussed\u2013Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 \u2013 ss. 185, 203, 204.Words & Phrases\u2013 \u201cunder the influence of alcohol\u201d\u2013 Contract of Insurance\u2013 Interpretation of\u2013 English Courts/Scottish Court and decisions from the United States \u2013 Discussed."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.14, ss.3(33), 96(3), 101(3) \u2013 \u201cTransaction\u201d in s.3(33) \u2013 Scope of s.14 \u2013 Held: s.14(1) makes it clear that subject to the exceptions contained in sub-sections (2) and (3), on the insolvency commencement date, the Adjudicating Authority shall mandatorily, by order, declare a moratorium to prohibit what follows in clauses (a) to (d) \u2013 s.14(1)(a) does not indicate as to what the proceedings contained therein apply to Sub-section 3(a) provides the answer that such \u201cproceedings\u201d relate to \u201ctransactions\u201d entered into by the corporate debtor pre imposition of the moratorium \u2013 s.3(33) defines \u201c transaction\u201d \u2013 This definition being an inclusive one is extremely wide in nature and would include a transaction evidencing a debt or liability \u2013 This is made clear by s.96(3) and s.101(3) which contain the same language as s.14(3)(a), these Sections speaking of \u2018debts\u2019 of the individual or firm. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.14(3)(b) \u2013 Held: By s.14(3)(b), a surety in a contract of guarantee of a debt owed by a corporate debtor cannot avail of the benefit of a moratorium as a result of which a creditor can enforce a guarantee, though not being able to enforce the principal debt during the period of moratorium. Insolvency and Banckruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.14 \u2013 Object of \u2013 Discussed.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.14 vis-\u00e0-vis ss. 81, 85, 96, 101 \u2013 Scope of proceedings \u2013 Held: When the language of these Sections is juxtaposed against the language of s.14, it is clear that the width of s.14 is even greater, given that s.14 declares a moratorium prohibiting what is mentioned in clauses (a) to (d) thereof in respect of transactions entered into by the corporate debtor, inclusive of transactions relating to debts, as contained in ss.81, 85, 96, and 101 \u2013 Also, s.14(1)(d) is conspicuous by its absence in any of these Sections \u2013 Thus, where individuals or firms are concerned, the recovery of any property by an owner or lessor, where such property is occupied by or in possession of the individual or firm can be recovered during the moratorium period, unlike the property of a corporate debtor \u2013 Negotiable Instrument Act, 1881 \u2013 s.138, 141, 143A, 148.

Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 \u2013 s.138 \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s.53 \u2013 Plea that proceedings u/s.138 can only be described as criminal proceedings \u2013 Held: Rejected \u2013 There are many instances of acts which are punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been described as quasi-criminal \u2013 There is nothing wrong with the appellation \u201cquasi-criminal\u201d being applied to a s.138 proceeding \u2013 Companies Act, 1956 \u2013 s.630 \u2013 Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 \u2013 ss.2, 11, 12.Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 \u2013 s.139 \u2013 Presumption under \u2013 Discussed. Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 \u2013 s.140 \u2013 Held: It shall not be a defence in a prosecution for an offence u/s.138 that the drawer had no reason to believe when he issued the cheque that the cheque may be dishonoured on presentment for the reasons stated in that Section, thus strict liability will attach, mens rea being no ingredient of the offence.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Res judicata \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Held: The prayer for withdrawal of the Resolution Plan in the First Withdrawal Application was not substantial and one that the Court was bound to grant, since it was contingent upon a re-evaluation, which in itself was contingent upon receiving the information sought in prayers (i) and (ii) \u2013 Since the latter two contingencies never arose, the NCLT did not apply its mind to the prayer for withdrawal independently \u2013 When it filed the Second Withdrawal Application, it was dismissed on a technical ground and not on its merits \u2013 When a revised Third Withdrawal Application was filed, the NCLT then adjudicated it on its merits and allowed it \u2013 Hence, since the NCLT did not adjudicate Resolution applicant \u2018E\u2019 prayer for withdrawal of their Resolution Plan on its merits while dismissing the First Withdrawal Application, the opportunity to seek the relief was not available to resolution applicant \u2018E\u2019 in a real sense \u2013 Therefore, the finding of the NCLAT on this issue is reversed and hold that resolution applicant \u2018E\u2019 Third Withdrawal Application was not barred by res judicata."

Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule, List II, Entries 1, 2 & 18 \u2013 Committee on Peace and Harmony constituted by Delhi Legislative Assembly in the wake of Delhi riots \u2013 Validity of \u2013 Held: The Assembly is no different from any other State assembly, except to the extent that certain powers in List II of the Seventh Schedule have not been conferred (i.e., Entries 1, 2 & 18) \u2013 Assembly admittedly does not have any power to legislate on aspects of law and order and police in view of Entries 1 and 2 of List II in the Seventh Schedule inter alia being excluded \u2013 Assembly does not only perform the function of legislating; there are many other aspects of governance which can form part of the essential functions of the Legislative Assembly and consequently the Committee \u2013 Committee can trace its legitimacy to several Entries in List II and List III without encroaching upon the excluded fields of public order or police to undertake a concerted effort albeit not to the extent as canvassed \u2013 In the larger context, the concept of peace and harmony goes much beyond law and order and police, more so in view of on the-ground governance being in the hands of the Delhi Government. Constitution of India \u2013 Articles 194, 105 \u2013 Functions performed by an elected Parliament or Assembly not confined to only enacting laws \u2013 Role of Committees constituted by legislative bodies in the functioning and the working of the Houses Held: Unless the committee embarks on a course completely devoid of its functional mandate specified by the Assembly, or the Assembly itself lacks jurisdiction to deal with the subject matter, the widest amplitude must be given to the functioning of these committees \u2013 The inquisitorial role of the committee in the functioning of House is of great significance, and as recognized, the investigation of a complicated social problem prior to legislation often rests frequently on such legislative committees \u2013 Intelligent legislative action and deliberation thereon rests on the power to investigate into questions of public importance and, thus, issuance of summons is key to this investigative exercise. Constitution of India \u2013 Articles 194, 105; Seventh Schedule, List II, Entries 1 and 2 \u2013 Para 4(vii) of the Terms of Reference tasked the Committee with recommending action against such persons against whom incriminating evidence is found \u2013 Held: In order to justify the legislative competence and the remit of the Committee, the respondents have practically given up this para \u2013 It does not survive for any opinion of the Committee \u2013 Further, it will not be permissible for the Committee to encroach upon any aspects strictly within the domain of Entries 1 and 2 of List II of the Seventh Schedule \u2013 As such, any representative of the petitioners would have the right to not answer questions directly covered by these two fields. Constitution of India \u2013 Part III \u2013 Issue of privileges vis-\u00e0-vis the right of free speech, silence, and privacy \u2013 Held: Larger issue of privileges vis-\u00e0-vis the right of free speech, silence, and privacy in the context of Part III of the Constitution is still at large in view of the reference to the larger Bench in N. Ravi v. Legislative Assembly reported as (2005) 1 SCC 603."

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.61(1) \u2013 Limitation period for filing an appeal against order of NCLT \u2013 Held: Litigant has to file its appeal within thirty days, which can be extended up o a period of fifteen days, and no more, upon showing sufficient cause \u2013 Court is not empowered to condone delays beyond statutory prescriptions in special statutes containing a provision for limitation. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.61(2) \u2013 Companies Act 2013 \u2013 s.420(3) \u2013 National Company Law Tribunal Rules, 2016 \u2013 r.50 \u2013 Held: s.420(3), Companies Act r/w r.50, NCLT Rules enables a party to compute limitation from the date of receipt of the statutorily mandated free certified copy, without having to file its own application \u2013 However, Sagufa Ahmed v. Upper Assam Plywood Products Pvt Ltd clarified that the statutory mandate of a free copy is not to enable litigants to take two bites at the apple where they could compute limitation from either when the certified copy is received on the litigant\u2019s application or received as a free copy from the registry- whichever is later.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 ss.61(1), (2) \u2013 Companies Act 2013 \u2013 s.421(3) \u2013 Held: ss.61(1) and (2) of the IBC consciously omit the requirement of limitation being computed from when the \u201corder is made available to the aggrieved party\u201d, in contradistinction to s.421(3) of the Companies Act.

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.61(2) \u2013 Limitation Act, 1963 \u2013 s.12 \u2013 Held: s.12 provides guidance on reckoning the period of limitation and excludes the time taken by a party forobtaining a certified copy of the order it seeks to appeal \u2013 However, the explanation clarifies that the time taken by the court in preparing the order before an application for a copy is filed by the aggrieved party, is not excluded from the computation of limitation. National Company Law Appellate Tribunal Rules \u2013 rr.14, 22 \u2013 Held: It may well be true that waivers on filing an appeal with a certified copy are often granted for the purposes of judicial determination, they do not confer an automatic right on an applicant to dispense with compliance and render r.22(2), NCLAT Rules nugatory.

Evidence \u2013 Murder \u2013 Non-examination of independent witnesses \u2013 Held: A large number of villagers had gathered at the spot after the incident \u2013 However, none of the independent witnesses were examined by the prosecution \u2013 Since the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution are interested witnesses, non- -examination of independent witnesses, though available, would make the prosecution version doubtful.

        "HeadNote": "Will: Suspicious circumstances in execution of will \u2013 Bequest made in the name of testator\u2019s son to the exclusion of testator\u2019s daughters \u2013 Testator\u2019s son lived for eleven years after the death of their father \u2013 Petition seeking Letters of Administration filed fifteen years after the death of the testator by wife of testator\u2019s son \u2013 Daughters of testator defendants sought for dismissal of the petition on the ground that the will was fabricated \u2013 Held: It is highly improbable that the only son of the testator who was a practicing advocate and on whom the bequest of the house was made, was unaware of the execution of the will by his father \u2013 It is unnatural that the father would not have disclosed to his only son about the bequest of the property and had also not taken his son\u2019s assistance in the drafting as well as execution of the will \u2013 The testator had suffered a paralytic stroke which had affected his speech, mobility of his right arm and right leg and he was bedridden for a period of ten months prior to his death \u2013 Taking these circumstances into consideration, a doubt is created as to whether the testator was in a sound and disposing state of mind at the time of making of the testament which was fifteen days prior to his death \u2013 The said suspicion in the mind of the Court has not been removed by the propounder of the will i.e. first plaintiff by producing any contra medical evidence or the evidence of the doctor who was treating the testator prior to his death \u2013 Testator had himself stated in the alleged will that he was sick and getting weak even then he is stated to have \u201cwritten\u201d the will himself which is not believable \u2013 s.63 of the Succession Act, 1925 categorically states that the testator has to sign on the will and the signature of the testator must be such that it would \u201cintend\u201d thereby to give effect to the writing of a will \u2013 Hence, the genuineness of the will must be proved by proving the intention of the testator to make the testament and for that, all steps which are required to be taken for making a valid testament must be proved by placing concrete evidence before the Court \u2013 There is no evidence as to whom the testator gave instructions to write the will \u2013 The scribe was also not examined \u2013 In order to prove the execution of the document such as a testament, at least one of the attesting witnesses who had attested the same must be called to give evidence for the purpose of proof of its execution \u2013 One attestor had died \u2013 The second attestor, PW2 had given his evidence \u2013 PW2 deposed that the will could not be registered as the testator was unwell and in fact, he was bedridden \u2013 His deposition was rather fatal to the case of the beneficiary of the Will \u2013 Trial Court had also not believed the evidence of PW2 \u2013 Respondents-plaintiffs were not successful in proving the validity of the will in accordance with law inasmuch as the suspicious circumstances surrounding the very execution of the will were not cleared by any cogent evidence, rather, the genuineness of will remained in doubt \u2013 The alleged Will not being a valid document in the eye of law, no Letters of Administration can be granted to the respondents-plaintiffs \u2013 Succession Act, 1925 \u2013 s.63. Judgment/Order: Reasoned order \u2013 Duty of Appellate court while affirming, modifying or reversing the judgment of lower court \u2013 Held: The Appellate Court has jurisdiction to reverse, affirm or modify the findings and the judgment of the Trial Court \u2013 However, while reversing or modifying the judgment of a Trial Court, it is the duty of the Appellate Court to reflect in its judgment, conscious application of mind on the findings recorded supported by reasons, on all issues dealt with, as well as the contentions put forth, and pressed by the parties for decision of the Appellate Court \u2013 No doubt, when the Appellate Court affirms the judgment of a Trial Court, the reasoning need not to be elaborate although re- appreciation of the evidence and reconsideration of the judgment of the Trial Court are necessary concomitants \u2013 But while reversing a judgment of a Trial Court, the Appellate Court must be more conscious of its duty in assigning the reasons for doing so \u2013 In the instant case, High Court has dealt with the judgment of the Trial Judge in a short cut method, bereft of all reasoning while reversing the judgment of the Trial Court both on facts as well as law. Judgment/Order: Duty of Appellate court, while reversing the judgment of lower court \u2013 Held: While writing a judgment of reversal, an Appellate Court must remain conscious of two principles \u2013 Firstly, the findings of facts based on conflicting evidence arrivedat by the Trial Court must weigh with the Appellate Court, more so when the findings are based on oral evidence recorded by the same Presiding Judge who authors the judgment \u2013 If, on an appraisal of the evidence, it is found that the judgment of the Trial Court suffers from a material irregularity or is based on inadmissible evidence or on conjectures and surmises, the Appellate Court is entitled to interfere with the finding of fact but by assigning cogent reasons for doing so \u2013 Otherwise, the findings of the Trial Court should not be interfered with lightly on a question of fact \u2013 Secondly, while reversing a finding of fact, it is necessary that the Appellate Court assigns its own reasons for doing so \u2013 This is especially so in case there are further appeals under s.100, CPC, as the first Appellate Court is the final court of facts and the said findings are immune from challenge in a second appeal. Appeal: Right to file appeal \u2013 Held: Right to appeal is a creature of statute \u2013 The right to file an appeal by an unsuccessful party assailing the judgment of the Original Court is a valuable right and hence a duty is cast on the Appellate Court to adjudicate a first appeal both on questions of fact and applicable law \u2013 Hence, the re-appreciation of evidence in light of the contentions raised by the respective parties and judicial precedent and the law applicable to the case have to be conscientiously dealt with."

        "HeadNote": "Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 \u2013 s.3 \u2013s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) \u2013 Under the second proviso, a new threshold was declared for an allottee to move an application u/s.7 for trigerring the insolvency resolution process under the Code \u2013 The second proviso provided that for financial creditors who were allottees under a real estate project, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor was to be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such allottees under the same real estate project or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such allottees under the same real estate project, whichever is less \u2013 Challenge to the second proviso to s.7(1) \u2013 Held: Not tenable \u2013 The object of the Statute, admittedly, is to ensure that there is a critical mass of persons (allottees), who agree that the time is ripe to invoke the Code and to submit to the inexorable processes under the Code, with all its attendant perils \u2013 The rationale behind, confining allottees to the same real estate project, is to promote the object of the Code \u2013 Once the threshold requirement can pass muster when tested in the anvil of a challenge based on Arts. 14, 19 and 21, then, there is both logic and reason behind the legislative value judgment that the allottees, who must join the application under the impugned provisos, must be related to the same real estate project \u2013 Allottees under real estate projects are financial creditors, but they possess certain characteristics, which set them apart from generality of the financial creditors, such as numerosity; heterogeneity; and individuality in decision making \u2013 If a single allottee, as a financial creditor, is allowed to move an application u/s.7, the interests of all the other allottees may be put in peril \u2013 In the circumstances, if the Legislature, taking into consideration, the sheer numbers of a group of creditors, viz., the allottees of real estate projects, finds this to be an intelligible differentia, which distinguishes the allottees from the other financial creditors, who are not found to possess the characteristics of numerosity, then, it is not for this Court to sit in judgment over the wisdom of such a measure \u2013 The allottee continues to be a financial creditor \u2013 All that is envisaged is the legislative value judgment that a critical mass is indispensable for allottees to be present before the Code, can be activised \u2013 The purport of the critical mass of applicants would ensure that a reasonable number of persons similarly circumstanced, form the view that despite the remedies available under the RERA or the Consumer Protection Act or a civil suit, the invoking of the Code is the only way out, in a particular case \u2013 If the Legislature felt that having regard to the consequences of an application under the Code, when such a large group of persons, pull at each other, an additional threshold be erected for exercising the right u/s.7, certainly, it cannot suffer a constitutional veto at the hands of Court exercising judicial review of legislation \u2013 This is not a case where the right of the allottee is completely taken away \u2013 All that has happened is a half-way house is built between extreme positions, viz., denying the right altogether to the allottee to move the application u/s.7 of the Code and giving an unbridled license to a single person to hold the real estate project and all the stakeholders thereunder hostage to a proceeding under the Code \u2013Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.7. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 \u2013 s.3 \u2013 s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, incorporating three provisos to s.7(1) \u2013 The first proviso provided that for financial creditors, referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (6A) of s.21, an application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtor shall be filed jointly by not less than one hundred of such creditors in the same class or not less than ten per cent of the total number of such creditors in the same class, whichever is less \u2013 Challenge to \u2013 Held: The first proviso is invulnerable \u2013 The legislative understanding is clear that in regard to such creditors bearing the hallmark of large numbers they are required to be treated differently \u2013 If they are not treated differently it would spell chaos and the objects of the Code would not be fulfilled It is an extension of this basic principle which has led to the insertion of the impugned proviso \u2013 Insisting on a threshold in regard to these categories of creditors would lead to the halt to indiscriminate litigation which would result in an uncontrollable docket explosion as far as the authorities which work the Code are concerned \u2013 The debtor who is apparently stressed is relieved of the last straw on the camel\u2019s back, as it were, by halting individual creditors whose views are not shared even by a reasonable number of its peers rushing in with applications \u2013 Again, as in the case of the allottees, this is not a situation where while treating them as financial creditors they are totally deprived of the right to apply under s.7 as part of the legislative scheme \u2013 The legislative policy reflects an attempt at shielding the corporate debtor from what it considers would be either for frivolous or avoidable applications \u2013 All that the amendment is likely to ensure is that the filing of the application is preceded by a consensus at least by a minuscule percentage of similarly placed creditors that the time has come for undertaking a legal odyssey which is beset with perils for the applicants themselves apart from others \u2013 As far as the percentage of applicants contemplated under the proviso it is clear that it cannot be dubbed as an arbitrary or capricious figure \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.7. A Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 \u2013 s.4 \u2013 s.4 of the impugned amendment, incorporated an additional Explanation in s.11 of the Code \u2013 While s.11 is about persons not entitled to make application for initiating corporate insolvency resolution process, the additional Explanation provided that nothing in section 11 prevented a corporate debtor from initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against another corporate debtor \u2013 Held: The provisions of the impugned Explanation clearly amount to a clarificatory amendment \u2013 A clarificatory amendment is retrospective in nature \u2013 The Explanation merely makes the intention of the Legislature clear beyond the pale of doubt \u2013 The argument of the petitioners that the amendment came into force only on 28.12.2019 and, therefore, in respect to applications filed under ss.7, 9 or 10, it will not have any bearing, cannot be accepted \u2013 The Explanation, in the facts of these cases, is clearly clarificatory in nature and it will certainly apply to all pending applications also \u2013 The intention of the Legislature was always to target the corporate debtor only insofar as it purported to prohibit application by the corporate debtor against itself, to prevent abuse of the provisions of the Code \u2013 It could never had been the intention of the Legislature to create an obstacle in the path of the corporate debtor, in any of the circumstances contained in s.11, from maximizing its assets by trying to recover the liabilities due to it from others \u2013 Not only does it go against the basic commonsense view but it would frustrate the very object of the Code, if a corporate debtor is prevented from invoking the provisions of the Code either by itself or through his resolution professional, who at later stage, may, don the mantle of its liquidator \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.11, Explanation II. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 \u2013 s.10 \u2013 s.10 of the impugned amendment inserts s.32A in the Code \u2013 It was contended that but for s.32A, the properties which are acquired could be attached but that is pre-empted by s.32A \u2013 The petitioners contend that immunity granted to the corporate debtors and its assets acquired from the proceeds of crimes and any criminal liability arising from the offences of the erstwhile management for the offences committed prior to initiation of CIRP and approval of the resolution plan by the adjudicating authority further jeopardizes the interest of the allottees/creditors \u2013 Held: No case whatsoever is made out to seek invalidation of s.32A \u2013 The boundaries of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction are clear \u2013 The wisdom of the legislation is not open to judicial review \u2013 Having regard to the object of the Code, the experience of the working of the code, the interests of all stakeholders including most importantly the imperative need to attract resolution applicants who would not shy away from offering reasonable and fair value as part of the resolution plan if the legislature thought that immunity be granted to the corporate debtor as also its property, it hardly furnishes a ground for this Court to interfere \u2013 The provision is carefully thought out \u2013 It is not as if the wrongdoers are allowed to get away \u2013 They remain liable \u2013 The extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor is apparently important to the new management to make a clean break with the past and start on a clean slate \u2013 The immunity is premised on various conditions being fulfilled \u2013 There must be a resolution plan \u2013 It must be approved \u2013 There must be a change in the control of the corporate debtor \u2013 The new management cannot be the disguised avatar of the old management \u2013 It cannot even be the related party of the corporate debtor \u2013 The new management cannot be the subject matter of an investigation which has resulted in material showing abetment or conspiracy for the commission of the offence and the report or complaint filed thereto \u2013 These ingredients are also insisted upon for claiming exemption of the bar from actions against the property \u2013 Significantly every person who was associated with the corporate debtor in any manner and who was directly or indirectly involved in the commission of the offence in terms of the report submitted continues to be liable to be prosecuted and punished for the offence committed by the corporate debtor \u2013 The corporate debtor and its property in the context of the scheme of the code constitute a distinct subject matter justifying the special treatment accorded to them \u2013 Creation of a criminal offence as also abolishing criminal liability must ordinarily be left to the judgement of the legislature \u2013 Attaining public welfare very often needs delicate balancing of conflicting interests \u2013 As to what priority must be accorded to which interest must remain a legislative value judgement and if seemingly the legislature in its pursuit of the greater good appears to jettison the interests of some it cannot unless it strikingly ill squares with some constitutional mandate suffer invalidation \u2013 There is no basis at all to impugn the Section on the ground that it violates Articles 19, 21 or 300A \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.32A. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020 \u2013 s.3 \u2013s.3 of the impugned amendment, amended s.7(1) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Amendment by s.3 of the impugned amendment incorporated three provisos to s.7(1) \u2013 The third proviso provided that where an application for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process against a corporate debtor has been filed by a financial creditor referred to in the first and second provisos and has not been admitted by the Adjudicating Authority before the commencement of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act, 2020, such application shall be modified to comply with the requirements of the first or second proviso within thirty days of the commencement of the said Act, failing which the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn before its admission \u2013 Held: The third proviso is a one-time affair \u2013 It is intended only to deal with those applications, u/s.7, which were filed prior to 28.12.2019, when, by way of the impugned Ordinance, initially, the threshold requirements came to be introduced by the first and the second impugned provisos \u2013 In other words, the legislative intention was to ensure that no application u/s.7 could be filed after 28.12.2019, except upon complying with the requirements in the first and second provisos \u2013 The Legislature did not stop there \u2013 It has clearly intended that the threshold requirement it imposed, will apply to all those applications, which were filed, prior to 28.12.2019 as well, subject to the exception that the applications, so filed, had not been admitted, u/s.7(5) \u2013 In other words, the Legislature intended that in every application, filed under s.7, by the creditors covered by the first proviso and by the allottees governed by the second proviso, should also be embraced by the newly imposed threshold requirement for which, it was intended, should be complied within 30 days from the date of the Ordinance \u2013 However, this restriction was not to apply to those applications which stood admitted as on the date of the Ordinance \u2013 It is also clear that the consequence of failure to comply with the threshold requirement, in regard to applications, which have been filed earlier, was that they would stand withdrawn \u2013 When applications were filed under the unamended provisions of s.7, at any rate it would transform into a vested right \u2013 The vested right is to proceed with the action till its logical and legal conclusion \u2013 No doubt, there may not be a vested right as regard mere procedure and while limitation, ordinarily, belongs to the domain of procedure, should new law shorten the existing period of limitation, such a law would not operate in regard to the right of action which is vested \u2013 Every sovereign Legislature is clothed with competence to make retrospective laws \u2013 It is open to the Legislature, while making retrospective law, to take away vested rights \u2013 If a vested right can be taken away by a retrospective law, there can be no reason why the Legislature cannot modify the vested rights \u2013 The imposition of a threshold requirement being a mandatory and irreducible minimum even, if it is to be achieved as and after the date of the amendment, constitutes an intrusion into the substantive right of action vested in the individual creditor \u2013 The action of the creditor was not a completed transaction \u2013 As regards his conduct in the past, viz., moving u/s.7, it is incomplete but the action was commenced \u2013 But the law (the 3 rd proviso) impairs the past action qua the future \u2013 Imposing the threshold requirement under the 3 rd proviso, is not a mere matter of procedure \u2013 It impairs vested rights \u2013 Prescribing a time limit in regard to pending applications, cannot be, per se, described as arbitrary, as otherwise, it would be an endless and uncertain procedure \u2013 The applications would remain part of the docket and also become a Damocles Sword overhanging the debtor and the other stakeholders with deleterious consequences also qua the objects of the Code \u2013 Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 s.7. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 \u2013 Need of \u2013 Held: The Code was an imperative need for the nation to try and catch up with the rest of the world, be it in the matter of ease of doing business, elevating the rate of recovery of loans, maximization of the assets of ailing concerns and also, the balancing the interests of all stakeholders.Amendment \u2013 Clarificatory amendment \u2013 Is retrospective in nature.Legislation \u2013 Plenary Legislation \u2013 Challenge to \u2013 Grounds \u2013 Discussed. Legislation \u2013 Plenary Legislation \u2013 Challenge to \u2013 On ground of malice \u2013 Held: While malice may furnish a ground in an appropriate case to veto administrative action, malice does not furnish a ground to attack a plenary law."

        "HeadNote": "Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 \u2013 ss.19, 38-E \u2013 Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 \u2013 Protected tenant \u2013 Oral surrender of the tenancy rights, if permissible \u2013 High Court set aside the order dtd.19.2.82 passed by Revenue Divisional Officer granting occupancy rights to predecessor-in-interest of the appellants- purchaser as well as the order passed by Joint Collector dismissing the appeal filed by the protected tenant \u2013 Occupancy rights granted to the purchaser stood annulled \u2013 On appeal, held: Surrender of oral tenancy of a protected tenant is not permissible under the Tenancy Act except in the manner prescribed u/s.38-E (5) r/w s.19, Tenancy Act \u2013 In the present case, the oral surrender by the protected tenant is set up in the year 1954 followed by sale of tenancy rights in 1957 \u2013 Thereafter, the petition u/s.19, Tenancy Act was filed to seek approval of the Tenancy rights, but was withdrawn on the basis of an order withdrawing the appeal against the grant of occupancy rights \u2013 Thus, the purchasers took steps to procure surrender of tenancy rights, realizing that such surrender cannot be oral or by executing a sale deed \u2013 It was a cover up operation initiated by the purchaser \u2013 Since, neither the oral surrender nor surrender in writing was recorded as bonafide by the Tehsildar, the subsequent surrender approved by Mandal Revenue Officer is a nullity as such surrender is in contravention of the statutory provisions \u2013 Protected tenant was conferred ownership rights u/s.38-E, Tenancy Act on 23.3.75 whereas the conferment of occupancy rights were granted in the year 1982 under the Inams Act \u2013 On grant of certificate of ownership u/s.38-E, the protected tenants shall be deemed to be the full owners of such land \u2013 Once the protected tenants are deemed to be owners, there could not be any occupancy rights certificate as the purchasers were divested of their ownership by virtue of the grant of ownership certificate u/s.38-E, Tenancy Act \u2013 Appeals allegedly filed by the protected tenant against the grant of occupancy rights certificate and subsequently being withdrawn is wholly inconsequential \u2013 Title of the protected tenants is complete and the ownership vests with them \u2013 Entitled to restoration of possession. Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 \u2013 ss.19, 32, 38-E \u2013 Held: Neither s.19 nor s.32 forming part of Chapter III of the Tenancy Act are applicable in respect of protected tenant except when the reference is made to the provisions of s.19 on the basis of s.38-E(5) which starts with a non obstante clause giving overriding effect to anything contained in s.38-E. Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Abolition of Inams Act, 1955 \u2013 Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950 \u2013 Operation of the Acts \u2013 Held: Both the Inams Act and the Tenancy Act are enacted by the same Legislature \u2013 The Inams Act is a later Act enacted in 1955 but s.38-E (1) was substituted in 1971 which starts with a non- obstante clause\u2013 Therefore, ownership certificate granted under the Tenancy Act would prevail over the grant of occupancy rights certificate under the Inams Act \u2013 Both the Acts operate in different spheres."
