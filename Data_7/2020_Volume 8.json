(for himself and ArunMishra, J.) \u2013 An employer has a right to withhold the gratuity duringthe pendency of the disciplinary proceedings, and the disciplinaryauthority has powers to impose the penalty of dismissal/major penaltyupon the employee even after his attaining the age ofsuperannuation, as the disciplinary proceedings were initiated whilethe employee was in service \u2013 The Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972govern the conditions concerning payment of gratuity \u2013 It cannotcontrol and provide with respect to an employer\u2019s right to hold adepartmental inquiry after retirement, and there is no provisionprescribing what kind of punishment can be imposed in thedepartmental inquiry if it is continued after attaining the age ofsuperannuation \u2013 The relevant rules would govern such matters \u2013Since no statutory provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972come in the way of the CDA Rules to continue the inquiry aftersuperannuation of the employee in case it was instituted while hewas in service and his deemed continuance in service; thus, nofetter is caused upon operation of Rule 34.2 providing for acontinuation of the inquiry and deemed continuation of the employeein service after the age of superannuation \u2013 At the conclusion ofsuch disciplinary proceedings any of the penalty provided underRule 27 of the CDA Rules can be imposed by the authority includingthe order of dismissal and apart from that in case pecuniary losshad been caused that can be recovered \u2013Per Ajay Rastogi, J. (Partlydissenting): After conclusion of the disciplinary inquiry, if anemployee/delinquent is held guilty, indeed a penalty can be inflictedupon him who stood retired from service and what should be thenature of penalty would always depend on the relevant scheme ofRules and on the facts and circumstances of each case, but eitherof the substantive penalties specified under Rule 27 of the Rules,1978 including dismissal from service are not open to be inflictedon conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings and the punishmentof forfeiture of gratuity commensurate with the nature of guilt maybe inflicted upon a delinquent employee provided under Rule 34.3of Rules, 1978 read with sub-section (6) of s.4 of the Act, 1972 \u2013Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972."

(i) undertrial prisoners/convicted persons whoare facing trial or convicted to the maximum punishment of 7 yearsor less, (ii) The convicted persons whose sentence is above 7 yearsand (iii) The undertrial prisoners or convicted persons who arebooked for serious economic offences/ bank scams and offencesunder Special Acts such as MCOC, PMLA etc. \u2013 The petitionersalleged discrimination in categorisation \u2013 The High Court held thatthe decision of HPC does not call for interference except to theextent of observations that were made in paragraph 36 of the order\u2013 On appeal, held: The said categorisation cannot be consideredas unreasonable since at the first instance, the categorisation isrequired by the Court for grant of interim bail if such undertrial/convicted person is seeking bail purely on taking benefit of thenotification issued pursuant to such decision taken by the HPC \u2013The exclusion made has a reasonable basis and cannot be termedarbitrary \u2013 The present methodology for grant of the interim bail iswith the intention to avoid overcrowding in the unprecedentedcircumstance and the grant of bail in the present circumstances isan additional benefit to such persons \u2013 In that circumstance whathas been curtailed by the HPC by excluding certain categories isonly with a view to deny the benefit to certain category of jail inmateswho are charged with serious offences which as an adverse effecton the society at large though the length of the punishment that canbe imposed may be lesser \u2013 Such of those persons charged underthe special enactments or convicted for a period, more than 7 yearsin any event if they are not otherwise disentitled to bail in the normalcircumstance could still seek bail in accordance with law \u2013 All thatthe HPC has denied them is the benefit of seeking interim bail onlyon the ground that they are entitled to be released in view of theCovid-19 situation and no other legal right has been denied \u2013 TheHigh Court was accordingly justified in its conclusion."

State (NarcoticBranch of Delhi) has authoritatively settled the law that merelybecause the informant is the investigator, by that itself theinvestigation would not suffer the vice of unfairness or bias andtherefore on the sole ground that informant is the investigator, theaccused is not entitled to acquittal \u2013 Thus, in the instant case thereis no reason to draw any adverse inference against PW-8 himselfinvestigating his complaint \u2013 Certain actions (or lack thereof) bythe investigation or chinks in the prosecution case can\u2019t be the solebasis for concluding bias \u2013 Further, the claim of appellants thatseized contraband was carried by an unknown stranger is ex-faciefanciful and is without any evidence \u2013 Infact, this has bolstered theprosecution case that appellants were present on the spot andinteraction with police had taken place and that search was notbased on any prior information but was spontaneous and thus, itwas a case of chance recovery \u2013 PW-3 himself claims that he wasnot present at the time of incident, his statement can at best beconstrued to mean that no charas was recovered in front of him,and not that no charas was recovered from the appellants at all \u2013As correctly appreciated by the High Court in detail, non-examination of independent witnesses would not ipso facto entitleone to seek acquittal \u2013 The High Court has rightly relied upon thetestimonies of the government officials having found them to beimpeccable after detailed re-appreciation of the entire evidence \u2013Thus, there is no merit in the appeals and the respondent-State isdirected to take appellants into custody to serve the remainder oftheir ten-year sentences."

        "HeadNote": " Contempt of Court \u2013 Criminal Contempt of Court \u2013 In suo motu proceedings, Contemnor (an advocate) held guilty by Supreme Court \u2013 Court granted time to Contemnor to make unconditional apology, if he so desired \u2013 Contemnor filed supplementary statement reiterating that his statements in twitter were bonafide and pleaded truth as valid defence \u2013 Held: The twin requirement for considering the truth as valid defence, as per s. 13 of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is that such defence is in public interest and the request for invoking such defence is bona fide \u2013 In the facts of the case, the defence taken cannot be said to be either in public interest or bonafide, rather the Contemnor has indulged in making reckless allegations further aggravating the contempt \u2013 Even after conviction order, no remorse expressed nor apology submitted \u2013 A simple warning is not going to suffice in the present case \u2013 Duly balancing the factors as to the offender, offence and convicting judgment and the defence taken and in view of conduct of the contemnor, showing magnanimity, the Court, instead of imposing severe punishment, sentenced the contemnor with a nominal fine of Rs. 1/- \u2013 On default the Contemnor to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of 3 months and further be debarred from participating in Supreme Court for a period of 3 years. Judiciary \u2013 Though a fair criticism of judgment is permissible in law, a person cannot exceed the right u/Art.19(1)(a) to scandalize the institution \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19(1)(a). Judiciary \u2013 If a scathing attack is made on the judges, it would become difficult for them to work fearlessly and with the objectivity of approach to the issues \u2013 The judgment can be criticized \u2013 However, motives to the Judges need not be attributed, as it brings administration of justice into disrepute \u2013 Administration of Justice. Advocates / Legal Profession \u2013 Lawyers, as a class, are looked by the public as intelligentsia. Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19(1)(a) \u2013 Free Speech is part of Art. 19(1)(a) \u2013 However, it cannot be said that while exercising power u/Art.129, the Court is interfering with the rights under Art.19(1)(a) \u2013 Supreme Court being a court of record can punish for contempt \u2013 Free Speech is essential to democracy, but it cannot denigrate one of the institutions of the democracy. Constitution of India \u2013 Art.129 \u2013 While exercising powers u/ Art.129, the Court will have to strike a balance between the right u/ Art.19(1)(a) and restrictions under Art.19(2) \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.19(1)(a) and 19(2). Advocates / Legal Profession \u2013 Role and duty of \u2013 Held: Lawyers\u2019 noble profession will lose all its significance and charm and dignity if the lawyers are permitted to make any malicious, scandalous and scurrilous allegations against the institution of which they are part \u2013 Lawyers are supposed to be fearlessly independent and robust but at the same time respectful to the institution. Judiciary \u2013 Interference with judicial process \u2013 Release of statement to press in advance \u2013 Held: In a sub judice matter, releasing statement to the press in advance is an act of impropriety and has the effect of interfering with the judicial process and the fair decision making and is clearly an attempt to coerce the decision of the Court by the influence of newspaper and media, which cannot be said to be conducive for fair administration of justice and would further tantamount to undue interference in the independent judicial making process which is the very foundation of institution of administration of justice \u2013 Administration of Justice. Contempt of Court \u2013 Criminal contempt \u2013 Apology \u2013 Held: The Court has to be satisfied as to the genuineness of the apology to make an order that contemnor has purged himself of the contempt. Administration of Justice \u2013 It is not expected of a person who is a part of the system of administration of justice and who owes a duty to the said system, to make tweets capable of shaking the confidence of general public and further making wild allegations in affidavit thereby further attempting to malign the institution. Rule of Law \u2013 Supremacy of \u2013 Strong arm of the law strikes a blow on him who challenges supremacy of the rule of law by fouling its source and stream \u2013Court has to act only where attack is beyond a permissible limit.
