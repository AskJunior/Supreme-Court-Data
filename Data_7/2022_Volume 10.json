Held: MACP Scheme is applicable with effect from 1.9.2008 \u2013 Supreme Court in Union of India and Others v. M.V. Mohanan Nair has already answered the second issue \u2013 It was held that under the MACP Scheme, financial upgradations are granted at three regular intervals on completion of 10-20-30 years of service without promotion \u2013 MACP Scheme puts an end and rectifies the problem arising from inter-departmental disparities in re the pay scales of the next promotional post \u2013 It is seen that the term \u201cgrade pay in the next promotional post\u201d is conspicuously absent in the entire body of the MACP Scheme \u2013 Under MACP the entitlement is to financial upgradation equivalent to immediate next grade pay and not to the immediate next promotional post \u2013 The third issue, which relates to the fulfilment of pre-promotional norms for grant of financial upgradation, is decided against the appellantUnion of India to the extent that this would not be insisted in the case of the Central Armed Forces personnel where, for administrative or other reasons, they could not be sent or undergo the pre-promotional course."

Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961 \u2013 s.13 (prior to its substitution in the year 1983) \u2013 Impact of \u2013 Discussed. Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act, 1961 \u2013 s.13 \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.XLI, r.5 \u2013 Plea of the appellantstenants that s.13 of the Act, being a special law, the power under Or. XLI r.5, cannot be exercised to direct deposit or payment of mesne profits \u2013 Held: Not acceptable \u2013 Compliance with s.13 by the appellants, does no amount to a stay of the Decree for Eviction \u2013 The power of the Appellate Court to impose conditions for staying the Decree, cannot be confined by the dictate in s.13 of the Act, to the appellants/tenants, to deposit the agreed rent, particularly, having regard to the time consumed in litigation and, more importantly, the impact of the Decree of Eviction, depriving the appellant of his status as a tenant. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Heading of a section \u2013 Held: The heading of a section cannot control the construction of the provision itself \u2013 The provision, as it unfolds under the heading, must be given the full meaning according to the principles of interpretation, which the court is persuaded to apply \u2013 The only area where the heading may be useful is when the provision is shrouded in ambiguity \u2013 The heading may shed some light, however, faint it may be."

State of Bihar ought to be complied with in letter and spirit by the investigating and prosecuting agencies \u2013 While the view expressed by the Supreme Court on the non-compliance of Section 41 and the consequences that flow from it has to be kept in mind by the Court, which is expected to be reflected in the orders \u2013 To take care of not only the unwarranted arrests, but also the clogging of bail applications before various Courts, all the State Governments and the Union Territories directed to facilitate standing orders, to comply with the mandate of Section 41A \u2013 There need not be any insistence of a bail application while considering the application u/ss. 88, 170, 204 and 209 of the Code. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Special Courts \u2013 Constitution of \u2013 The State and Central Governments will have to comply with the directions issued by Supreme Court from time to time with respect to constitution of special courts \u2013 The High Court in consultation with the State Governments will have to undertake an exercise on the need for the special courts \u2013 The vacancies in the position of Presiding Officers of the special courts will have to be filled up expeditiously.Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss. 436A, 440 \u2013 Undertrial Prisoners \u2013 The statistics placed before the Court indicated that more than 2/3rd of the inmates of the prisons constitute undertrial prisoners \u2013 Of this category of prisoners, majority may not even be required to be arrested despite registration of a cognizable offense, being charged with offenses punishable for seven years or less \u2013 The High Courts are directed to undertake the exercise of finding out the undertrial prisoners who are not able to comply with the bail conditions \u2013 After doing so, appropriate action will have to be taken in light of sec. 440, facilitating the release \u2013 While insisting upon sureties the mandate of sec. 440 of the Code has to be kept in mind \u2013 An exercise will have to be done in a similar manner to comply with the mandate of sec. 436A both at the district judiciary level and the High Court as earlier directed by this Court in Bhim Singh, followed by appropriate orders. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Bail Application \u2013 Disposal of \u2013 Timeframe \u2013 Bail applications ought to be disposed of within a period of two weeks except if the provisions mandate otherwise, with the exception being an intervening application \u2013 Applications for anticipatory bail are expected to be disposed of within a period of six weeks with the exception of any intervening application. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Sec. 167(2) \u2013 Object and presumption under \u2013 It has got a laudable object behind it, which is to ensure an expeditious investigation and a fair trial, and to set down a rationalised procedure that protects the interests of the indigent sections of society \u2013 This is also another limb of Art. 21 \u2013 Presumption of innocence is also inbuilt in this provision \u2013 The right enshrined is an absolute and indefeasible one, inuring to the benefit of suspect \u2013 A duty is enjoined upon the agency to complete the investigation within the time prescribed and a failure would enable the release of the accused \u2013 Such a right cannot be taken away even during any unforeseen circumstances \u2013 As a consequence of the right flowing from Sec.167(2), courts will have to give due effect to it, and thus any detention beyond this period would certainly be illegal, being an affront to the liberty of the person concerned \u2013 Therefore, it is not only the duty of the investigating agency but also the courts to see to it that an accused gets the benefit of Section 167 (2).Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Sec. 170 \u2013 Scope and ambit \u2013 A power which is to be exercised by the court after the completion of the investigation \u2013 In a case where the prosecution does not require custody of the accused, there is no need for an arrest when a case is sent to the magistrate u/s. 170 \u2013 There is not even a need for filing a bail application, as the accused is merely forwarded to the court for the framing of charges and issuance of process for trial \u2013 However, cases in which the accused persons are already in custody, then, the bail application has to be decided on its own merits \u2013 There needs to be Strict Complanace of he mandate laid down in Siddharth v. State of U.P. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss. 88 & 204 \u2013 s. 204 gives a discretion to a Magistrate, and being procedural in nature, it is to be exercised as a matter of course by following the prescription of sec. 88 \u2013 Thus, issuing a warrant may be an exception in which case the Magistrate will have to give reasons. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 209 \u2013 It gives ample power to the Magistrate to remand a person into custody during or until the conclusion of the trial \u2013 Since the power is to be exercised by the Magistrate on a case-to-case basis, it is his wisdom in either remanding an accused or granting bail \u2013 Even here, it is judicial discretion which the Magistrate has to exercise \u2013 A Magistrate can take a call even without an application for bail if he is inclined to do so. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 sec. 309 \u2013 Bail \u2013 It mandates courts to continue the proceedings on a day-to-day basis till the completion of the evidence \u2013 Any delay on the part of the court or the prosecution would certainly violate Art. 21 \u2013 Courts shall make sure that the accused does not suffer for the delay occasioned due to no fault of his own \u2013 Therefore, while it is expected of the court to comply with sec. 309 to the extent possible, an unexplained, avoidable and prolonged delay in concluding a trial, appeal or revision would certainly be a factor for the consideration of bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 sec. 389 \u2013 Bail \u2013 It concerns itself with circumstances pending appeal leading to the release of the appellant on bail \u2013 The power exercisable u/s. 389 is different from that of the one either u/ss. 437 or 439, pending trial \u2013 This is for the reason that \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d and \u201cbail is the rule and jail is the exception\u201d may not be available to the appellant who has suffered a conviction \u2013 A mere pendency of an appeal per se would not be a factor \u2013 However, delay in taking up the main appeal or revision coupled with the benefit conferred u/s. 436A of the Code among other factors ought to be considered for a favourable release on bail. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 sec. 436A \u2013 In a case where an appeal is pending for a longer time, to bring it u/s. 436A, the period of incarceration in all forms will have to be reckoned, and so also for the revision \u2013 When a person has undergone detention for a period extending to one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified for that offense he shall be released by the court on his personal bond with or without sureties \u2013 There is not even a need for a bail application in a case of this nature particularly when the reasons for delay are not attributable against the accused. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 sec. 437 \u2013 It empowers the Magistrate to deal with all the offenses while considering an application for bail with the exception of an offense punishable either with life imprisonment or death triable exclusively by the Court of Sessions. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 sec. 440 \u2013 The amount of every bond executed is to be fixed with regard to the circumstances of the case and shall not be excessive \u2013 Reasonableness of the bond and surety is something which the court has to keep in mind whenever the same is insisted upon, and therefore while exercising the power u/s. 88 also the said factum has to be kept in mind \u2013 Imposing a condition which is impossible of compliance would be defeating the very object of the release. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss. 436A, 309 167(2), 440 \u2013 Special Acts \u2013 The general principle governing delay would apply to Special Acts also \u2013 To make it clear, the provision contained in sec. 436A would apply to the Special Acts also in the absence of any specific provision \u2013 There is a need to comply with the directions of this Court to expedite the process and also a stricter compliance of Sec. 309 \u2013 The existence of a pari materia or a similar provision like sec.167(2) available under the Special Act would have the same effect entitling the accused for a default bail \u2013 Even here the court will have to consider the satisfaction u/s. 440. Bail \u2013 Whether Economic Offences should be treated as a class of its own or otherwise \u2013 The gravity of the offence, the object of the Special Act, and the attending circumstances are a few of the factors to be taken note of, along with the period of sentence \u2013 After all, an economic offence cannot be classified as such, as it may involve various activities and may differ from one case to another \u2013 Therefore, it is not advisable on the part of the court to categorise all the offences into one group and deny bail on that basis. Practice and Procedures \u2013 Criminal Trial \u2013 Approach of the Court - Criminal courts in general with the trial court in particular are the guardian angels of liberty - Any conscious failure by the Criminal Courts would constitute an affront to liberty - It is the pious duty of the Criminal Court to zealously guard and keep a consistent vision in safeguarding the constitutional values and ethos - A criminal court must uphold the constitutional thrust with responsibility mandated on them by acting akin to a high priest. Bail Application \u2013 Judicial Dispensation - Courts tend to think that the possibility of a conviction being nearer to rarity, bail applications will have to be decided strictly, contrary to legal principles \u2013 The Court cannot mix up consideration of a bail application, which is not punitive in nature with that of a possible adjudication by way of trial \u2013 On the contrary, an ultimate acquittal with continued custody would be a case of grave injustice \u2013 Uniformity and certainty in the decisions of the court are the foundations of judicial dispensation - Persons accused with same offense shall never be treated differently either by the same court or by the same or different courts \u2013 Such an action though by an exercise of discretion despite being a judicial one would be a grave affront to Arts. 14 and 15 of the Constitution of India. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Trial - Defined - An extended meaning has to be given to this word for the purpose of enlargement on bail to include, the stage of investigation and thereafter - In the former stage, an arrest followed by a police custody may be warranted for a thorough investigation, while in the latter what matters substantially is the proceedings before the Court in the form of a trial - An appeal or revision shall also be construed as a facet of trial when it comes to the consideration of bail on suspension of sentence. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Bail \u2013 Defined - A bail is nothing but a surety inclusive of a personal bond from the accused - It means the release of an accused person either by the orders of the Court or by the police or by the Investigating Agency - It is a conditional release on the solemn undertaking by the suspect that he would cooperate both with the investigation and the trial - Bail is the rule and jail is the exception. Presumption of innocence - Onus on the prosecution to prove the guilt before the Court - Presumption of innocence being a facet of Article 21, shall inure to the benefit of the accused \u2013 The weightage of the evidence has to be assessed on the principle of beyond reasonable doubt."

        "HeadNote": "Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 s.15 \u2013 Proviso to s. 15(1) \u2013 Directory or Mandatory \u2013 Held: Well settled principle of interpretation that the word \u2018may\u2019 when used in a legislation by itself does not connote a directory meaning \u2013 If in a particular case, in interest of equity and justice it appears to the court that the intent of the legislature is to convey a statutory duty, then the use of the word \u201cmay\u201d will not prevent the Court from giving it a mandatory colour \u2013 Looking to the purpose of the Act, 2015 and its legislative intent, particularly to ensure the protection of best interest of the child, the expression \u201cmay\u201d in the proviso to s.15(1) thereof and the requirement of taking assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts would operate as mandatory unless the Board itself comprises of at least one member who is a practicing professional with a degree in child psychology or child psychiatry \u2013 Moreover, in case the Board, in view of its own composition with at least one member, who is a practicing professional with a degree in child psychology or child psychiatry, chooses not to take such assistance, it would record specific reasons therefor. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 s.15 \u2013 Preliminary assessment under \u2013 Language used in s.15 is \u201cthe ability to understand the consequences of the offence\u201d \u2013 The expression used is in plurality i.e., \u201cconsequences\u201d of the offence and, therefore, would not just be confined to the immediate consequence of the offence \u2013 Consequences could be in material / physical form but also affecting the mind and the psychology of the child for all times to come \u2013 Individualised assessment of adolescent mental capacity and ability to understand the consequences of the offence is one of the most crucial determinants of the preliminary assessment mandated by s.15 \u2013 The report of the preliminary assessment decides the germane question of transferring the case of a child between 16 to 18 years of age to the Children\u2019s Court \u2013 This evaluation of \u2018mental capacity and ability to understand the consequences\u2019 of the child in conflict with law can, in no way, be relegated to the status of a perfunctory and a routine task \u2013 The process of taking a decision on which the fate of the child in conflict with law precariously rests, should not be taken without conducting a meticulous psychological evaluation. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 Social Investigation Report (SIR) \u2013 Relevance \u2013 Held: Preparation of SIR is a statutory requirement for every child in conflict with law, which is to be prepared by the Probation Officer or any other agency as may be directed by the Juvenile Justice Board \u2013 The object of getting an SIR prepared is to obtain as much as possible information about the background of the child \u2013 SIR is a relevant material to be considered by the Board to take a decision while passing any orders regarding bail or after inquiry or preliminary assessment. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 \u2013 Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 \u2013 Timeline provided for the inquiry, submission of Social Investigation Report (SIR), preliminary assessment and investigation under the Act, 2015 and the Model Rules \u2013 Object and Rationale \u2013 Held: The timeline given under the various provisions, has a rationale \u2013 The SIR to be submitted within fifteen days would facilitate the Board in taking a decision on the request for bail at the earliest \u2013 The period of one month given under r.10(5) is to facilitate the Board to take a decision may be on a pending bail matter or for preliminary assessment for which three months\u2019 time is provided \u2013 The completion of inquiry within four months or any extended period is to ensure that a child is not subjected to unnecessary long and lengthy processes of trials and inquiries and that the matter is taken to its logical conclusion at the earliest. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 \u2013 s.15 \u2013 Task of preliminary assessment u/s.15 is a delicate task with requirement of expertise and has its own implications as regards trial of the case \u2013 Appropriate and specific guidelines in this regard \u2013 Central Government and the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights to consider issuing guidelines or directions which may assist and facilitate the Juvenile Justice Board in making preliminary assessment u/s.15."

Arbitration Law \u2013 Concepts of costs and fees in arbitration \u2013 Distinguished. Arbitration Law \u2013 Ad hoc arbitration \u2013 Direction / guidelines issued for governing proceedings in ad hoc arbitrations. In the instant arbitration petition, the following issues in relation to the arbitrators\u2019 fees arose for consideration: (i) Whether the arbitrator (s) are entitled to unilaterally determine their own fees; (ii) Whether the term \u201csum in dispute\u201d in the Fourth Schedule to the Arbitration Act means the cumulative total of the amounts of the claim and counterclaim; (iii)Whether the ceiling of Rs 30,00,000 in the entry at Serial No 6 of the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration Act is applicable only to the variable amount of the fee or the entire fee amount; and (iv)Whether the ceiling of Rs 30,00,000 applies as a cumulative fee payable to the arbitral tribunal or it represents the fee payable to each arbitrator."

Sentence/Sentencing: Enhancement of quantum of punishment by the High Court from seven years to that of life imprisonment for offence punishable u/s. 121 A IPC \u2013 Justification of \u2013 Held: If conspiracy as entered into by the accused-members of LeT, to cause large scale destruction of public property, multi-national companies, places of worships, by causing bomb explosions, attacks on innocent people, had been carried out, it would have resulted in great damage and prejudice to the life and well-being of the members of the general public as well as loss to the public property \u2013 Such conspiracies to cause danger to public property or to the safety of the members of the general public ought to be dealt with strictly \u2013 Thus, the High Court justified in enhancing the sentence \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 s. 121A. Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: s.196 \u2013 Prosecution for offences against the State and for criminal conspiracy to commit such offence \u2013 Sanction u/s. 196 \u2013 Plea that in terms of s. 196, the sanction to prosecute the accused for having committed offence punishable inter alia under Chapter VI of the IPC was mandatory and the sanction placed on record did not satisfy the requirements \u2013 Correctness and validity of the sanction accorded u/s.196 \u2013 Held: Matter was considered by the Office of the Home Minister and the Chief Minister and consent was accorded to the proposal put up in usual course of business, whereafter, the communication was addressed by the Under Secretary \u2013 Thus, it cannot be said that the sanction was not accorded by the competent authorities \u2013 Sanction in terms of s.196 was valid and proper."

Land Laws \u2013 Municipalities \u2013 Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 \u2013 Haryana Municipal Act, 1973 \u2013 Whether if whole or part of the Panchayat area comes within the municipal limits, and the Panchayat ceases to exist, land would vest with the municipality and will not revert back to the proprietors \u2013 Held, No \u2013 s.7(4) of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 is to be read with the provisions of the 1973 Municipal Act \u2013 However, both the statutes had undergone extensive changes after the insertion of Part IX and IX A in the Constitution empowering the third tier of the democratic set up \u2013 The Panchayati Raj Act contemplates vesting of property of Gram Panchayat with the municipality, whereas the Municipal Act takes into its ambit the properties which were vesting with Panchayat \u2013 The 1973 Municipal Act contemplates that even if part of the property of Gram Panchayat is included in the Municipal Limits, it would vest with the municipality \u2013 Thus, the word \u2018whole\u2019 appearing in s.7(4) of Panchayati Raj Act does include part of the Gram Panchayat area coming within the municipal limits \u2013 Thus, if the whole or part of Gram Panchayat area is included in the municipal limits, the land reserved for common purposes as part of agrarian reforms would stand vested with the municipality \u2013 Such vesting is not a part of agrarian reforms but shall be on account of extension of municipal limits \u2013 When the municipal limits are extended, the residents of the Panchayat also became residents of the municipality \u2013 The common purposes of the village community prior to extension of the municipal limits would be deemed to be common purposes for which land can be utilized by the municipality \u2013 Therefore, such vesting of land reserved for common purposes is not an acquisition for the first time but transition of the land reserved for common purposes in the changed scenario when the land vest with the municipality \u2013 The argument of the proprietors that if whole of the Sabha area merges with the municipality, only then there can be vesting of land reserved for common purposes with the municipality is untenable \u2013 Such an argument would lead to anomalous results \u2013 The title, right and interest of the property cannot be held in abeyance \u2013 There has to be continued control and management over the land reserved for common purposes under the 1948 Act \u2013 Therefore, even if a part of Sabha area is merged into the municipality, the municipality will have control over the land so reserved for the erstwhile village community which will now form part of the urban area \u2013 East Punjab Holdings (Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation) Act, 1948. Land Laws \u2013 Haryana Common Purposes Land Eviction and Rent Recovery Act, 1985 \u2013 Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 \u2013 Held: The scope of the provisions under the 1985 Act and the 1961 Act are different and distinct."
