and that the issue of aerial distance certificate cannot bereopened again\u2013Subsequently the State of Maharashtra directedthat in terms of proviso to Clause 6A of the Control Order, 1966 nonew sugar factory would be set up within the radius of 25 kms ofany existing sugar factory or any other new factory\u2013 Thereafter,the time limit for implementing industrial entrepreneur memorandumwas amended \u2013 Appellant then sought NOC in view of the order ofthe High Court which was not granted by State authorities \u2013Consequently, the appellant applied for extension of time andchange of location due to earlier location being no developmentzone and was accepted \u2013 Writ petition by the existing sugar factorychallenging grant of extension and change of location\u2013 Governmentallowed the extension a couple to times till 2020\u2013 Another writpetition filed by the existing sugar factory challenging grant ofextension and change of location \u2013 High Court held that theappellant had not taken any effective steps within the period of two years from the date of the acknowledgement of EMI; that the IEMstood de-recognized before the Sugar Control Order was amendedon 26.08.2016 which extended the period of implementation;thatextensions were granted in violation to the provisions of the Rulesand the Statute; and that as per the amendment, the new sugarfactory had to be at a distance of not less than 25 kms\u2013Issue aroseas regards, whether in the absence of any interim order against theappellant in the first round of litigation, the period during whichwrit petitions were pending are liable to be excluded; whether theState/ Central Government was justified in excluding such periodwhile granting extension of IEM; whether the lis initiated againstthe appellant is a sufficient reason to exclude the period spent insuch litigation and was a reasonable ground for the State/CentralGovernment to extend IEM; whether the amended Control Order interms of proviso to Clause 6C as amended by the State ofMaharashtra on 03.12.2011 would be applicable when the HighCourt in the earlier writ petition has held that the issue of AerialDistance Certificate cannot be reopened at the instance of theappellant or any other party again, and whether the IEM standslapsed on the failure on the part of entrepreneur to set up the sugarfactory and start production within the time specified in Clause 6Cor such lapsing would be only after an order in terms of Clause 6Dof the Control Order is passed \u2013 Held: Latin maxim \u2018Actus CuriaeNeminem Gravabit\u2019, states that the act of the Court will not prejudiceanyone - During the whole litigation history, the appellant was atthe receiving end of the writ petitions, thus, the period spent in suchlis cannot be used against him - Though there was no interim orderpassed in the writ petitions, such petitions created a cloud on theright of the appellant to set up a sugar factory at the locationearmarked and to commence commercial production - Writ petitionsremained pending for a period of four years, the period spent indefending such writ petitions was validly taken into considerationby the State/Central Government to grant extension of time limitfixed in the Control Order - Extensions were given when the secondround of litigation was pending before the High Court due to whichthe appellant was not able to take effective steps- Decision of thecompetent authority to grant extensions of time was a proper exerciseof the powers- the subsequent amendment in the Control Order wouldnot have any application towards the IEM already issued\u2013Unless the performance guarantee is forfeited, there is no lapsing of IEM\u2013Twin conditions have to be fulfilled, (i) failure to set up plant andto commence production and then (ii) the forfeiture of theperformance guarantee \u2013 Second will not arise unless the first issatisfied and the second step cannot be undertaken, withoutcomplying with an opportunity of personal hearing in terms ofClause 6D of the Control Order \u2013 Unless the necessaryconsequences of de- recognition of IEM are undertaken, there isno automatic lapsing of IEM \u2013 Appellant had furnished aperformance guarantee of Rs. 1 crore, however, no steps taken eitherby State Government or by the Central Government to forfeit suchperformance guarantee inasmuch as not even a show cause noticewas issued \u2013 Thus, a conclusion cannot be drawn that the IEM isdeemed to be lapsed automatically only on account of lapsing oftime \u2013Order passed by the High Court, is unsustainable and is setaside."
