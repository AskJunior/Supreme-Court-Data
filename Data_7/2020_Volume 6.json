Constitution of India \u2013 Para 5(1) of Schedule V \u2013 Scope of \u2013 Held: The Governor in the exercise of powers under para 5(1) of Schedule V of the Constitution, can exercise the powers concerning any particular Act of the Parliament or the legislature of the State \u2013 Para 5(1) of Schedule V confers power upon the Governor to exclude law, which is applicable in a Scheduled area \u2013 It also empowers the Governor to apply the same with exceptions and modifications as he deems fit \u2013 However, no new law can be formulated while exercising power under para 5(1) of Schedule V \u2013 The power of modification cannot extend to re-writing the entire statute.  Constitution of India \u2013 Para 5(1) of Schedule V and Art. 309 \u2013 A.P. State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1996 \u2013 rr. 22, 22 A \u2013 G.O.Ms. No. 3/2000 issued by the erstwhile State of Andhra Pradesh provided 100% reservation to the Scheduled Tribe candidates for the post of teachers in the schools in the scheduled areas \u2013 The G.O.Ms. No. 3/2000, inter alia, refers to the Rules, 1996 and the said rules have been framed under proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution \u2013 The rules 22 and 22 A framed u/Art.309 were amended \u2013 Held: The power of the Governor under Para 5(1) of Schedule V of the Constitution is restricted to modifying or not to apply, Acts of the Parliament or legislature of the State \u2013 Thus, the rules could not have been amended in the exercise of the powers conferred under Para 5(1) Schedule V \u2013 The rules made under the proviso to Art. 309 of the Constitution cannot be said to be an enactment by the State legislature \u2013 Thus, it was not open to the Governor to issue the impugned G.O.Ms. No. 3/2000. Constitution of India \u2013 Para 5(1) of Schedule V \u2013 Power of Governor extend to subordinate legislation or not \u2013 Held: The power of the Governor under Para 5(1), Fifth Schedule to the Constitution does not extend to subordinate legislation, it is with respect to an Act enacted in the sovereign function by the Parliament or legislature of the State which can be dealt with.

Constitution of India \u2013 Para 5(1) of Schedule V \u2013 Effect of the non-obstante clause \u2013 Held: The provision of the fifth Schedule beginning with the words \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this constitution\u201d cannot be construed as taking away the provision outside the limitation on the amending power and has to be harmoniously construed consistent with the fundamental principles and basic features of the Constitution. Constitution of India \u2013 Para 5(1) of Schedule V \u2013 Whether there is any conflict between the Presidential order and G.O.Ms. No. 3/2000 issued under the order of the Governor under para 5(1) of the Schedule V \u2013 Held: The Presidential order was issued providing district/zone for local cadre, on the other hand, the order issued by the Governor has reserved all the posts of teachers in the Scheduled Areas for Schedule Tribe candidates \u2013 The aspiring candidates of the district/ zone in the Scheduled Area cannot apply for the post of teachers in the district as 100% reservation was made vide G.O.Ms. No. 3/2000 by the Governor and it is also not disputed that aspiring candidates cannot apply outside the district/ zone because of the restrictions u/Art. 371D of the Constitution \u2013 Thus, there is a clear repugnancy between the notification issued by the president and the subsequent order issued by the Governor under Para 5(1) of the Schedule V \u2013 It is not possible to harmonise both notifications \u2013 The Governor is competent to issue an order which is not in conflict with Presidential Order \u2013 The Governor could not have issued the order in derogation to the Presidential order \u2013 In the instant case, 100% reservation could not have been provided as that violates the Presidential Order.

Constitution of India \u2013 G.O.Ms No. 3/2000 required candidate or the parents to reside in the area continuously w.e.f. 26.01.1950 to date \u2013 Propriety of \u2013 Held: There is no rhyme or reason to require continuous residence for last 50 years or more \u2013 It overlooks the rights of various other persons who might have settled decades together in the area in question \u2013 It is discriminatory vis-a-vis to the Scheduled tribes also settled in the area \u2013 The conditions of eligibility in the notification with cut-off date i.e. 26.01.1950, to avail benefit of reservation, is unreasonable and arbitrary one.

Insurance Policy \u2013 Expression \u201cin the ordinary course of transit\u201d, meaning of \u2013 Held: Expression \u201cin the ordinary course of transit\u201d depends on the context, object and the wording of the particular policy \u2013 In context of the policy, the words \u201cin transit\u201d do not require transportation of the consignment in a single trip from the commencement to the final destination but includes those interruptions in motion that are incidental to or in furtherance of the conveyance or transportation of the consignment \u2013 The question of what does and does not constitute a deviation in furtherance of the conveyance of the goods is a question of fact that must be determined by both the intent of the policy and the actions of the parties. Insurance Policy \u2013 Burden of proof \u2013 For the respondent to prove its case, a mere assertion that the loss incurred during the course of transit is not sufficient \u2013 Burden of proof lies on the respondent to show that the loss incurred was covered within the terms of the policy and that on a balance of probabilities there existed a proximate cause between the loss incurred and the consignment being in transit. Insurance Policy \u2013 Construction of \u2013 Held: Insurance policies should be construed according to the principles of construction generally applicable to commercial and consumer contracts \u2013 The court must interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties and not embark upon making a new contract for the parties \u2013 Interpretation of statutes.  Insurance Policy \u2013 Marine transit insurance policy \u2013 The purpose of the marine transit insurance policy is to cover the consignment from risks associated with transportation of the consignment from one place to another \u2013 It is fundamental for those responsible for carrying the cargo to ensure that all stages of the transportation are effected with reasonable promptness \u2013 \u201cIn transit\u201d, however, does not necessarily mean that the consignment needs to be in continuous motion at all times \u2013 A mere brief suspension must however be in furtherance of the ordinary course of transit \u2013 During the ordinary course of transit, the consignment might frequently come to rest or be temporarily stored in the dock awaiting loading or customs clearance \u2013 However, unduly protracted steps in the cargo\u2019s transportation are not within, and may terminate, the \u201cordinary course of transit.\u201d.

Will \u2013 Probate proceedings \u2013 Non-filing of written statement \u2013 Held: By the very nature and consequence of probate proceeding, filing or non-filing of written statement or objections by any party pales into insignificance and is of no effect \u2013 The probate proceeding is not merely inter-partes proceeding but leads to judgment in rem and, therefore, even when no one contests, it does not ipso facto lead to grant of probate \u2013 The probate is granted only on proof of Will as also on removal of suspicious circumstances, if there be any, to the final satisfaction of the conscience of the Court.

December, 1997 and Gujarat Urja paid deemed Generation Incentive \u2013 Thereafter, Gujarat Urja filed application for recovery of the amounts from CLP paid during the period from 1997-1998 to 2005-06 \u2013 GERC, by its order held that the notification of 06.11.1995 was applicable and deemed Generation Incentive is not payable to CLP \u2013 However, it permitted recovery of only for a period of three years prior to the date of filing of the petition: the recovery for the period prior to 14.09.2002 was held to be time-barred \u2013 APTEL upheld the order of the GERC \u2013 On appeal, held: The two notifications dated 30.03.1992 and 06.11.1995 were issued u/s. 43(A) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948 \u2013 Concededly, these notifications are statutory and are binding on the parties \u2013 Any PPA between a generating company and the purchaser of electricity is subject to such statutory notifications; parties by agreement cannot override statutory provisions, or such notifications, as far as they relate to matters of tariff \u2013 So, the notification amended on 06.11.1995 was a statutory one and was binding on both the parties \u2013 The effect of this statutory incorporation by way of amendment was that incentive no longer became payable \u2013 Also, the concurrent findings of the GERC and APTEL in granting restricted refund calculable for the 3 year period prior to Gujarat Urja\u2019s application are reasonable \u2013 The findings of the lower authorities, therefore, are correct; no interference required.  Electricity Supply Act, 1948 \u2013 s.43(A) \u2013 Gujarat Electricity Board (Gujarat Urja) entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with CLP on 03.02.1994 \u2013 In terms of the PPA, Gujarat Urja was under an obligation to purchase and CLP was under corresponding obligation to supply electricity \u2013 A supplementary agreement was executed between the parties on 05.12.2003 \u2013 CLP stated that the amount, i.e Rs. 53.90 crores was in fact due as a loan \u2013 If it was deemed as a loan, then interest was payable on the basis of normative repayment of principal amount during the period of the loan, i.e. the loan would not remain as a constant \u2013 Gujarat Urja resisted this claim \u2013 The GERC rejected the CLP\u2019s argument on a plain reading of the clause in the supplementary agreement, which stated that the agreement too recognized Rs.53.9 crores as own Capital for which the cost of Own Capital @ 14% was to be a pass through \u2013 The effective date for such recognition was from 01.07.2003 to 31.03.2009 and no amounts were due and payable as interest after that date \u2013 This excluded any liability on part of Gujarat Urja for the past period, i.e. December 1997 \u2013 The CLP Limited was aggrieved by that portion of GERC\u2019s order which rejected its claim on the deemed loan component prior to the period 2003 \u2013 The APTEL concurred with the decision of GERC \u2013 On appeal, held: The clear agreement between the parties was that interest on the sum of Rs.53.90 crores was payable for the specified period 01.07.2003 to 31.12.2009 \u2013 Therefore, CLP\u2019s claim that any amount was payable, for any period prior to 01.07.2003, was not tenable \u2013 Had CLP wished so, nothing prevented it to claim for it during negotiations and have it included as a term of the contract \u2013 Once having settled for a specified sum, on an amount Rs.53.90 crores that was only fictionally a loan - and treated as such, for purpose of fixing interest payable, considering the equity infused, in excess of the tariff regulations, the absence of any like item such as interest for prior period, precludes a claim \u2013 The findings of the lower authorities are therefore, sound and reasonable "

Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or.XLI, rr.23, 23A, 24 and 25 \u2013 Order of remand by the Appellate Court \u2013 Held: A conjoint reading of Rules 23, 23A and 24 of Or.XLI brings forth the scope as also contours of the powers of remand that when the available evidence is sufficient to dispose of the matter, the proper course for an Appellate Court is to follow the mandate of r.24 of Or.XLI CPC and to determine the suit finally \u2013 It is only in such cases where the decree in challenge is reversed in appeal and re-trial is considered necessary that the Appellate Court shall adopt the course of remanding case "

Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Tax incentive provisions \u2013 Held: The principles laid down in Constitution Bench in Dilip Kumar & Co., when applied to incentive provisions like those for deduction, would be that the burden lies on the assessee to prove its applicability to his case; and if there be any ambiguity in the deduction clause, the same is subject to strict interpretation with the result that the benefit of such ambiguity cannot be claimed by the assessee; rather it would be interpreted in favour of the revenue.

(1) of s.7-A of the 1959 Act, four eventualities are covered thereunder, with reference to the treatment of goods in question viz., (i) when they are consumed in manufacture of other goods for sale; or (ii) when they are consumed otherwise; or (iii) when they are used in manufacture of other goods for sale; or (iv) when they are used otherwise \u2013 The bottles in question have neither been consumed in manufacture of Beer/IMFL nor they could be said to have been used in such manufacture of Beer/IMFL, hence elements (i) and (iii) does not exist \u2013 The empty bottles are filled up with liquor but such filling up has not resulted in the bottles themselves being used up and bottles have retained their basic identity, hence the activity in question does not fall within the ambit of element (ii) \u2013 Insofar as (iv) element \u2018when they are used otherwise\u2019 is concerned, the process of bottling with the use of bottles was the unalienable part of the complete chain of processes that the assessee was obliged to undertake for its business i.e. manufacturing and selling the liquor \u2013 By this process, the bottles were used by the assessee in such a manner that they were no longer available for sale in the form they were purchased from unregistered dealers \u2013 That being the position, the bottles have indeed been \u2018used otherwise\u2019 by the assessee \u2013 Therefore, the activity of assessee in relation to the bottles in question is clearly covered by element (iv) of Clause (a) of sub-s. (1) of s.7-A of the Act and making it exigible to purchase tax \u2013 As far as benefit of Clarifications dated 09.11.1989 and 27.12.2000 are concerned, the Constitution Bench in Ratan Melting & Wire Industries held that no direction can be issued to enforce a Clarification or Circular contrary to the declaration of law by the Courts \u2013 Thus, the High Court after having found that purchase tax was leviable on the turnover in question u/s. 7-A of the Act, could not have issued directions for benefit with reference to the Clarifications/ Circulars dated 09.11.1989 and 27.12.2000, particularly when such Clarifications/ circulars do not stand in conformity with the statutory provisions and its interpretation by the Courts \u2013 Hence, the order of the High Court as regards the operation and effect of Clarifications/Circulars dated 09.11.1989 and 27.12.2000, cannot be approved Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act, 1959 \u2013 Taxability of Cash discount on price \u2013 The assessee is engaged in the business of manufacture of Beer and IMFL and for the said purpose purchased empty bottles from unregistered dealers \u2013 The Assessing Officer disallowed the exemption on cash discount allowed by the assessee to Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited and levied tax on the said cash discount \u2013 The assessee submitted that any cash or other discount on the price of goods sold cannot be included in the turnover for the levy of tax \u2013 The High Court relying on the decision in Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd. took the view that as per Explanation 2(iii) to s.2(r) of the Act, cash or other discount on the price of goods sold cannot be included in the turnover for the levy of tax and accordingly allowed in favour of the assessee and against the revenue \u2013 Held: The issue has rightly been decided by the High Court in favour of the assessee. Words and Phrases \u2013 \u2018Consume\u2019, \u2018use\u2019, \u2018manufacture\u2019, \u2018in\u2019 and \u2018otherwise\u2019 \u2013 discussed.

National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 \u2013 Environment Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 National Highways Act, 1956 \u2013 National Highways Authority of India Act, 1988 \u2013 An over-mining resulted in the destruction of a small hill by the side of the National Highway \u2013 The resultant debris and a part of hill collapsed and slid down to the road, claiming lives of a woman and her daughter \u2013 National Green Tribunal directed payment of compensation towards death and damages towards restitution \u2013 Propriety of \u2013 Held: A statutory corporation or local authority can be held liable in tort for injury occasioned on account of omission to oversee, or defective supervision of its activities contracted out to another agency \u2013 In the instant case, having regard to the duty imposed on the NHAI by virtue of ss. 4 and 5 of the Highway Act r/w. s. 16 of the NHAI Act, there can be no manner of doubt that the NHAI was responsible for the maintenance of the highway, including the stretch upon which accident occurred \u2013 The report of Sub-Divisional Officer highlighted the deficiencies, also NHAI\u2019s correspondence with the person carrying out extraction of minor minerals by cutting hills, reveal that authorities were aware of the danger and likelihood of risk to human life \u2013 The failure of the NHAI to ensure remedial action and likewise failure by person carrying out mineral extraction, to take measures to prevent the accident, prima facie disclose their liability \u2013 Therefore, the directions in this regard by the NGT, making NHAI and the person carrying out extraction of mineral to pay Rs. 15 lakhs to legal representatives of the deceased is justified \u2013 Further, the restitutionary order by the NGT, cannot be faulted. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 \u2013 Environment Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 National Green Tribunal concluded that no development and construction should be carried out within 100 feet of a \u2018lowest slope i.e., incline of any hill within its territorial limits, as well as hill-tops\u2019 \u2013 Propriety of \u2013 Held: The decisions of the Supreme Court in All Dimasa Students Union case, Mantri Technoze Pvt. Ltd. Case, the Hanuman Laxman Aroskar case and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board case all show that the NGT resorted to the appointment of technical and scientific experts in the relevant field, who studied the issue, made site inspections, and furnished reports \u2013 Such reports were subjected to discussion by the parties before the NGT, who were also given the opportunity of objecting to or making representations against such reports \u2013 Based on a final consideration of all these materials, and the submissions of parties before it, the NGT proceeded to issue directions \u2013 However, in the instant case, what NGT had before it was the report of the SDM and a report commissioned about the nature of the incident \u2013 Based on these limited inputs, without any rationale and based on no scientific or technical evidence, or experts\u2019 opinion, the Tribunal concluded that development and construction should not be carried out within 100 feet of \u2018lowest slope i.e. incline of any hill within its territorial limits, as well as hill-tops\u2019 \u2013 As a result, the directions issued by the Tribunal were improper and procedurally indefensible \u2013 Therefore, the said directions are set aside. National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 \u2013 Environment Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 The order/ notification dated 14.11.2017 of the State of Maharashtra, issued u/s. 154 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 \u2013 Legality of \u2013 Held: The State of Maharashtra has not shown any material or file containing the reasons behind the directive of 14.11.2017 \u2013 These directions were consequential to, and solely based on the directions of the NGT \u2013 The NGT directions with regard to no development and construction within 100 feet of a \u2018lowest slope i.e., incline of any hill within its territorial limits, as well as hill tops\u2019, were not based on any scientific evidence or report of any technical expert \u2013 The impugned notification does not specify what constitutes \u2018hills\u2019 \u2013 This makes the directions not only vague but also makes them arbitrary as they can be applied at will by the concerned authorities \u2013 These directions in the notification, only underlines the lack of any application of mind on the part of the State \u2013 Consequently the directions issued under the notification u/s. 154 (dated 14.11.2017) are quashed.
