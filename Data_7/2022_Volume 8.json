(1) of s.56 are not attracted \u2013 Non-application of mind is apparent on the face of the record as order dtd. 02.06.20 of the Judicial Magistrate (rejecting the proposal to detain the appellant and directing his immediate release subject to condition as stated) is not even considered in the impugned order though the appellant relied upon it in his reply \u2013 This is very relevant as the appellant was sought to be detained u/sub-sec.(3) of s.151, Cr.PC for 15 days on the basis of the same offences which are relied upon in the impugned order of externment \u2013 From 02.06.20 till the passing of the impugned order of externment, the appellant is not shown to be involved in any objectionable activity \u2013 Impugned order also does not disclose any application of mind on recording of subjective satisfaction of respondent no.2 on the basis of material on record that the order of externment should be for the maximum period of two years \u2013 An order of externment is not an ordinary measure and must be resorted to sparingly and in extraordinary circumstances \u2013 Impugned order of externment and that of the High Court is set aside. Maharashtra Police Act, 1951 \u2013 s.56 \u2013 Nature of power under \u2013 Duty of Competent Authority \u2013 Discussed. Maharashtra Police Act, 1951 \u2013 s.56 \u2013 Order of externment \u2013 Judicial review \u2013 Held: Court while testing the order of externment cannot go into the question of sufficiency of material based on which the subjective satisfaction has been recorded \u2013 However, it can always consider whether there existed any material on the basis of which a subjective satisfaction could have been recorded \u2013 As in the case of any other administrative order, the judicial review is permissible on the grounds of mala fide, unreasonableness or arbitrariness. Maharashtra Police Act, 1951 \u2013 ss.56 and 58 \u2013 Held: On a plain reading of s.58, it is apparent that while passing an order u/ s.56, the competent authority must mention the area or District or Districts in respect of which the order has been made \u2013 Moreover, the competent authority is required to specify the period for which the restriction will remain in force \u2013 Maximum period provided for is of two years \u2013 Therefore, an application of mind on the part of the competent authority is required for deciding the duration of the restraint order u/s.56 \u2013 On the basis of objective assessment of the material on record, the authority has to record its subjective satisfaction that the restriction should be imposed for a specific period"

Consumer Protection Act, 1986 \u2013 s.2(r) \u2013 Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 \u2013 Held: s.2(r) of the Consumer Protection Act defines unfair trade practice, which is exactly the same as the definition of unfair trade practice in MRTP Act \u2013 In case a consumer satisfies the consumer forum that the goods complained against, suffer from any defect or there is deficiency in service, the opposite party can be directed to remove the defect or replace the goods free from defect \u2013 The appropriate forum can direct removal of deficiency in service and direct the opposite party to discontinue the unfair trade practice or restrictive trade practice.Contract \u2013 Time when not essence of contract \u2013 Held: In the present case, though there is a clause in the Apartment Buyer Agreement (ABA) mentioning that the possession was to be handed over within a period of two and half to three years from the date of ABA, it cannot be said that time was made the essence of the contract as a reasonable extension of time for delivery was permissible as per clause 16 \u2013 Thus, there was no intention on the part of the appellants to insist on time being the essence of contract as they did not terminate the ABA due to delay in handing over possession of the apartments which they could have in accordance with clause 18 of the ABA \u2013 Allegation in the complaint is that the respondent committed unfair trade practice by seeking to recover large sums of money from the buyers without handing over possession of the flats \u2013 In the garb of delay in handing over possession of the property, the appellants are seeking possession of a property, the cost of which is more than 10 times the price at which it was offered, without even paying the balance basic sale price\u2013Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969."

Environmental Law \u2013 Precautionary principle \u2013 Held: The precautionary principle envisages that the State cannot refuse to act to preserve the environment simply because all the scientific data may not be available \u2013 If there is some data to suggest that environmental degradation is possible, the State must step into action to prevent it from taking place."

No.19 of 2016 filed by appellants\u2013DISCOMS for approval of PPA \u2013 However, on 4th January, 2018, appellantsDISCOMS filed IAs before the State Electricity Regulatory Commission for withdrawal of O.P. No.19 of 2016 and disposal of O.P. No.21 of 2015 \u2013 State Commission allowed withdrawal of O.P. No.19 of 2016 filed by appellants\u2013DISCOMS and consequentially dismissed O.P. No.21 of 2015 filed by HNPCL \u2013 Appeal of respondent no.1-HNPCL allowed by Appellate Tribunal for Electricity (APTEL) which directed the State Electricity Regulatory Commission to dispose of O.P. No.21 of 2015 and O.P. No.19 of 2016 on merits \u2013 Correctness of \u2013 Held: APTEL rightly held that, on account of the assurance given by the State of Andhra Pradesh/APDISCOMS, HNPCL had altered its position and as such, it was not permissible for the appellants-DISCOMS to withdraw O.P. No.19 of 2016 \u2013 Conduct of appellants-DISCOMS would disentitle them to withdraw the application \u2013 Argument, that on account of increase of the capital cost of the project, the appellants\u2013DISCOMS would be required to purchase power at much higher rate, also does not hold water since the State Electricity Regulatory Commission would only approve the cost as it would feel appropriate, as guided by the provisions u/ s.61 of the Act of 2003 and the Regulations; and merely because, the cost of the project is estimated by HNPCL at a particular amount, the State Commission is not bound to accept the same \u2013 Further, perusal of s.64 of the Act of 2003 would reveal that even a Generating Company is entitled to make an application for determination of tariff u/s.62 of the Act of 2003 \u2013 As such, the State Commission was wholly unjustified in dismissing O.P. No.21 of 2015 filed by HNPCL \u2013 For reasons unknown, appellants-DISCOMS took a decision to resile from their earlier stand, due to which, not only the huge investment made by HNPCL would go in waste, but also valuable resources of the public including thousands of acres of land would go in waste \u2013 Appellants-DISCOMS, which are instrumentalities of the State, could not be permitted to change their decision at their whims and fancies and, particularly, when it was adversarial to the public interest and public good \u2013 The record clearly showed that the change in decision was arbitrary, irrational and unreasonable \u2013 IAs filed by appellants\u2013DISCOMS, were acts, affecting public interest and public good, without there being any rational or reasonable basis for the same \u2013 Conduct of appellants\u2013 DISCOMS, deprecated \u2013 In any event, the impugned judgment of APTEL cannot be said to be prejudicial to the interests of any of the parties \u2013 What was done by APTEL was only to direct the State Electricity Regulatory Commission to dispose of the said two O.Ps on merits \u2013 Appeal dismissed with costs, quantified at Rs.5,00,000/ - \u2013 State Electricity Regulatory Commission to decide the said two O.Ps, expeditiously, within six months. Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.12 and 14 \u2013 Public Authority \u2013 State \u2013 Instrumentalities of the State \u2013 Held: Every action of a State is required to be guided by the touch-stone of non-arbitrariness, reasonableness and rationality \u2013 Every action of a State is equally required to be guided by public interest \u2013 Every holder of a public office is a trustee, whose highest duty is to the people of the country \u2013 The Public Authority is therefore required to exercise the powers only for the public good."

Jammu and Kashmir Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2013: ss.8, 48 \u2013 Plain reading of s.8 of the Act, 2013 indicates that whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court or the court is of the opinion that the accused person was a juvenile on the date of the commission of the offence, then it is mandatory for the court to make an inquiry and in the course of such inquiry, the court may take such evidence as may be necessary, however, not an affidavit, so as to determine the age of such person \u2013 At the end of the inquiry, if the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence under sub-section (1) of s.8, then in such circumstance, the court is obliged in law to forward the juvenile to the Juvenile Justice Board for passing appropriate order and the sentence \u2013 s.48 talks about a competent authority, whereas, s.8 is in respect to the court \u2013 However, what is relevant to note is that in both the Sections the word \u2018shall\u2019 has been used. Word and phrase: \u201cMay\u201d \u2013 When Mandatory \u2013 It is a well settled principle of interpretation that the word \u2018may\u2019 when used in legislation by itself does not connote a directory meaning \u2013 If in a particular case, in the interests of equity and justice it appears to the court that the intent of the legislature is to convey a statutory duty, then the use of the word \u2018may\u2019 will not prevent the court from giving it a mandatory colour \u2013 Jammu and Kashmir Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2014 \u2013 r.74."

LLC (EARLIER KNOWN AS INTERNATIONAL MERCHANDISING CORP.) v. COMMISSIONER, SERVICE TAX, NEW DELHI there exists a relationship of employer and employee between the agency which supplies the service and a person whose service is supplied \u2013 But the circular does not postulate that such a relationship must exist for the statutory definition to be attracted \u2013 Hence, the fact that there may be no relationship of employment between tennis player and FSE would not be dispositive for the purposes of the statutory definition in s.65(68) \u2013 No fault in the decision of the Tribunal. Finance Act, 1994: s.65(86b) \u2013 Definition of \u201cprogramme producer\u201d \u2013 Whether the agreements entered into by appellants with Zee Telefilms and Trans World International are covered under the definition of \u201cprogramme producer\u201d in s.65(86b) \u2013 Held: The expression \u201cprogramme producer\u201d would implicate a situation where a person has produced a programme on behalf of another person \u2013 In the present proceedings, the appellant produced the programmes and sold the telecast rights to Zee Telefilms and Trans World International \u2013 There was no production of a programme on behalf of the appellant either by Zee Telefilms Limited or by Trans World International \u2013 Therefore, the definition of \u201cprogramme producer\u201d in s. 65(86b) was not attracted in the present case. Finance Act, 1994: Extended period of limitation \u2013 Since, the issue was to be decided on the basis of interpretation of the provisions of s. 65(68) and 65(86b) of the Finance Act, there was no warrant to allow the invocation of the extended period of limitation \u2013 The extended period of limitation would clearly not stand attracted in respect of the first show cause notice \u2013 The show cause notice shall hence have to be confined to the normal period of limitation excluding the extended period. Finance Act, 1994: Imposition of penalty \u2013 Whether a valid ground for the imposition of a penalty was made out \u2013 Held: There was no warrant for the imposition of the penalty as the dispute in the present case essentially involved the interpretation of the statutory provisions and their inter play with the circular issued by the CBEC."

Contract Act, 1872 \u2013 s.23 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.13 \u2013 What is contemplated u/s.23 of the Contract Act is law, in all its forms, being immunised from encroachment and infringement by a contract, being enforced \u2013 Not only would a Statutory Rule be law within the meaning of Art.13 of the Constitution but it would also be law u/s.23 of the Contract Act. Contract \u2013 A contract may expressly or impliedly, be prohibited by provisions of a law \u2013 The intentions of the parties do not salvage such a contract."

No. 4681/ 2022,arbitrator committed patent illegality in applying two different notifications in determining the market value \u2013 Only course open is to set aside the award and allow the Arbitrator to reconsider the matter on that aspect \u2013 Impugned order set aside \u2013 Consequently, the awards, connected awards which are the subject matter in these appeals are also set aside \u2013 Arbitration proceedings remanded \u2013 Stamp Act, 1899.

II r. 2 to an amendment application \u2013 Held: Or.II r.2 operates as a bar against a subsequent suit if the requisite conditions for application thereof are satisfied and the field of amendment of pleadings falls far beyond its purview \u2013 The bar of Or. II r.2 applies only to the subsequent suits \u2013 Or. II r.2 cannot apply to an amendment which is sought on an existing suit. Specific Relief Act, 1963 \u2013 Suit for Specific Performance \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or. II r.2, Or. VI r.17 \u2013 Applicability of \u2013 Respondents instituted suit seeking specific performance of the agreement and in the alternative, prayed for damages \u2013 High Court permitted the Respondents to amend the plaint, seeking to enhance the amount towards the alternative claim for damages \u2013 Correctness of \u2013 Held: There is no merit in the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that the amendment application is liable to be rejected by applying the bar u/Or.II r.2 CPC \u2013 Or.II r.2 of CPC cannot apply to an amendment which is sought on an existing suit \u2013 Further, the amendment application is also not hit by the principle of constructive res judicata \u2013 The said principle has no application in the instant case, since there was no formal adjudication between the parties after full hearing \u2013 Litigation before this Court has come up at the stage when the courts below allowed the amendment of plaint for the purpose of enhancing the amount towards damages in the alternative to the main relief of specific performance of the contract \u2013 Also, it cannot be successfully urged that a suit for specific performance falling under the provisions of the 1963 Act would not be governed by the provisions of the CPC \u2013 It is, therefore, clear that to such a suit the provisions contained in Or.VI, r.17 of the CPC would apply and a plaintiff who has earlier failed to incorporate the reliefs for compensation or who has incorporated the reliefs for compensation but seeks amendment in the same, could seek the permission of the court to introduce these reliefs by way of amendment \u2013 Impugned order passed by the Division Bench of the High Court, affirming the order passed by the Single Judge allowing the amendment application not disturbed \u2013 Doctrine of constructive res judicata. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or. VI r. 17 \u2013 Amendment of pleadings \u2013 Held: All amendments are to be allowed which are necessary for determining the real question in controversy provided it does not cause injustice or prejudice to the other side \u2013 This is mandatory, as is apparent from the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d, in the latter part of Or.VI r.17 \u2013 In dealing with a prayer for amendment of pleadings, the court should avoid a hypertechnical approach, and is ordinarily required to be liberal especially where the opposite party can be compensated by costs \u2013 Where the amendment would enable the court to pin-pointedly consider the dispute and would aid in rendering a more satisfactory decision, the prayer for amendment should be allowed \u2013 Where the amendment merely sought to introduce an additional or a new approach without introducing a time barred cause of action, the amendment is liable to be allowed even after expiry of limitation \u2013 Delay in applying for amendment alone is not a ground to disallow the prayer \u2013 Where the aspect of delay is arguable, the prayer for amendment could be allowed and the issue of limitation framed separately for decision. Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or. VI r. 17 \u2013 Amendment of pleadings \u2013 When to be allowed and not to be allowed \u2013 Discussed. Specific Relief Act, 1963 \u2013 Proviso to s.21(5) and s.22(2) \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 Or. VI r. 17 \u2013 Held: The two provisos deal with the question of permitting the plaintiff to amend his plaint \u2013 It is not, as if, in the absence of these two provisos, it is not permissible in law for the plaintiff to carry out an amendment in his pleading by introducing a relief for enhanced compensation \u2013 r.17 of Order VI does confer power on a Court to allow a party to alter or amend his pleading in such manner and on such terms as may be just and allows all such amendments to be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties.Specific Relief Act, 1963 \u2013 s.21 \u2013 Scope and ambit of \u2013 Discussed \u2013 Specific Relief Amendment Act, 2018.
