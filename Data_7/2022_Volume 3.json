which period of limitation hadexpired \u2013 Whether the Kerala Act of 1998 encroached on judicialpowers of the courts and as such, was hit by the doctrine ofseparation of powers \u2013 Held: Though a law enacted by theLegislature may apparently seem to be within its competence but yetin substance if it is shown as an attempt to interfere with the judicialprocess, such law may be invalidated being in breach of doctrineof separation of powers \u2013 The Kerala Act of 1998, which has theeffect of annulling the awards which have become \u201cRules of Court\u201d,is a transgression on the judicial
