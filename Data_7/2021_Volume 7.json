Clause 22(ix)(a), 2(e) \u2013 Object of definition clauses \u2013 Held: Is to avoid frequent repetition in describing the subject matter to which the word or expression is intended to apply \u2013 This is useful when the same word or expression is used more than once in the same enactment \u2013 Definition can be with the intent to attract a meaning already established by law; expand the meaning by adding a meaning; or narrow the meaning by exclusion \u2013 Repugnancy will arise when the definition meaning does not agree with the subject in the context \u2013 On facts, repugnancy not indicated and does not arise in the context of Clause 22(ix)(a) by mere absence of article \u2018the\u2019 in Clause 22(ix)(a) before the word \u2018bank\u2019. Inquiry: Domestic inquiry \u2013 Choice of representation \u2013 Right of \u2013 Held: Right to be represented by a counsel or agent of one\u2019s choice is not an absolute right but can be controlled or regulated by law, rules, or regulations \u2013 However, if the charge is of severe and complex nature, then the request to be represented through a counsel or agent should be considered \u2013 Said proposition flows from the entitlement of fair hearing, applicable in judicial as well as quasi-judicial decisions. \u2018Acquiescence\u2019 and \u2018delay and laches\u2019 \u2013 Distinction between \u2013 Held: Doctrine of acquiescence is an equitable doctrine which applies when a party having a right stands by and sees another dealing in a manner inconsistent with that right \u2013 Acquiescence virtually destroys the right of the person \u2013 However, both limitation and laches destroy the remedy but not the right \u2013 Laches like acquiescence is based upon equitable considerations, but laches unlike acquiescence imports even simple passivity \u2013 On facts, inactive acquiescence on the part of the Bank Manager can beinferred till the filing of the appeal, and not for the period post filing of the appeal \u2013 Nevertheless, this acquiescence being in the nature of estoppel bars the Bank Manager from claiming violation of the right of fair representation.  Administrative law: Statutory authority \u2013 Non-performance of duty \u2013 Defence of delay and laches \u2013 Held: When the statutory authority does not perform its duty within a reasonable time, the same cannot be justified by taking the plea that the person deprived of his rights has not approached the appropriate forum for relief \u2013 Statutory authority cannot take the defence of laches and delay."

Policy decision \u2013 Judicial review of \u2013 Ambit and extent of \u2013 Held: Court cannot interfere with the soundness and wisdom of apolicy \u2013 Policy is subject to judicial review on the limited grounds of compliance with the fundamental rights and other provisions of the Constitution \u2013 Courts would show a higher degree of deference to matters concerning economic policy, compared to other matters of civil and political rights \u2013 State and its agencies often endeavor to make economically feasible decisions \u2013 On facts, loan waiver scheme is, in essence, a social policy in pursuance of the Directive Principles of State Policy, introduced with an object to eliminate inequality in status, income, and facilities. Term policy \u2013 Meaning of \u2013 Held: Policy is the reasoning and object that guides the decision of the authority \u2013 Statutes, notifications, ordinances, or Government orders are means for the implementation of the policy of the State \u2013 To appreciate a legislation, reference to the policy behind the law is required \u2013 Judicially evolved two-pronged test to determine the validity of the law vis-\u00e0-vis Art. 14 refers to the objective of the law because the \u2018policy\u2019 behind the law is never completely insulated from judicial attention \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 14 \u2013 Words and phrases. Constitution of India: test \u2013 Degree of proof under the test would impact the judgment of this Court on whether the law is under-inclusive or over- inclusive \u2013 Nexus test, unlike the proportionality test, is not tailored to narrow down the means or to find the best means to achieve the object \u2013 It is sufficient if the means have a \u2018rational nexus\u2019 to the object \u2013 Thus, the courts show a greater degree of deference to cases where the rational nexus test is applied \u2013 A greater degree of deference is shown to classification because the legislature can classify based on the degrees of harm to further the principle of substantive equality, and such classification does not require mathematical precision. A Introduction of Loan Waiver Scheme in pursuance of an electoral promise, if constitutionally suspect \u2013 Held: A scheme cannot be held to be constitutionally suspect merely because it was based on an electoral promise \u2013 Scheme can be held suspect only within the contours of the Constitution, irrespective of the intent with which the scheme was introduced. Art. 14 \u2013 Classification per se, if violative of Art. 14 \u2013 Held: Classification per se is not discriminatory and violative of Art.14 \u2013 Art. 14 only forbids class legislation and not reasonable classification \u2013 Classification is reasonable, when based on an intelligible differentia; and the differentia must have a rational relationship to the object sought to be achieved by the statute \u2013 There must be some yardstick to differentiate the class included and the others excluded from the group \u2013 Differentia used for the classification in the Loan Waiver scheme is the total extent of landholding by every individual \u2013 Thus, there is a yardstick used for constituting the class for the purpose of the scheme. Art. 14 \u2013 Under-inclusive and over-inclusive classification \u2013 Meaning and ambit of \u2013 Held: A statute is \u2018under-inclusive\u2019 if it fails to regulate all actors who are part of the problem \u2013 It is \u2018over- inclusive\u2019 if it regulates actors who are not a part of the problem that the statute seeks to address - Determination of under-inclusiveness and over- inclusiveness, and degree of deference to it is dependent on the relationship prong (\u2018rational nexus\u2019 or \u2018proportional\u2019) of the"

Service law: Upgradation and Promotion \u2013 Difference between \u2013 Held: There is a vast difference between the upgradation and the promotion \u2013 Ordinarily upgradation of a post would involve transfer of a post from lower to higher grade and placement of an incumbent of that post in the higher grade \u2013 Such placement would not involve any selection process to be followed, but would merely confer a financial benefit by raising the scale of pay of the post \u2013 However, in case of promotion, there would be an advancement to a higher position or rank along with an advancement to a highergrade \u2013 Therefore, the word \u201cpromotion\u201d would mean advancement or preferment in honour, dignity, rank and grade."

State of U.P., the High Court noted and determined the compensation @ Rs.28.12 paisa per square yard and same was confirmed by the Supreme Court \u2013 Therefore, as such at the most, the claimants can be said to be entitled to compensation @ Rs.28.12 paisa per square yard with regard to the lands acquired in the year 1976-1977."

        "HeadNote": " Wills \u2013 Bequest made under the Will \u2013 Nature of \u2013 Testator executed Will (in respect of property) in favour of his wife (plaintiff no.1) who in turn gifted the property in question to appellant (plaintiff no. 2) \u2013 Contention of defendants that the gift deed executed by plaintiff no.1 was null and void in view of a limited life estate conferred upon her under the Will \u2013 Held: While the trial Court took the view that under the Will, the testator\u2019s wife was given only a limited right of enjoyment for life, the First Appellate Court held that what was bequeathed was full rights of enjoyment, including the right to transfer \u2013 High Court did not overturn the finding of fact recorded by the First Appellate Court \u2013 Instead, the High Court wrongly proceeded to analyse sub-sections (1) and (2) of s.14 of the Hindu Succession Act, to come to the conclusion that the limited estate did not get enlarged into full ownership \u2013 The question of fact whether what was conveyed under the Will, was only a limited right of enjoyment or full ownership, was settled by the First Appellate Court in favour of the plaintiffs \u2013 This finding was not held by the High Court to be perverse \u2013 Though the High Court thought that one of the substantial questions of law arising for consideration was whether testator\u2019s wife was full owner or limited owner, the High Court chose to answer this question not on the basis of the recitals contained in the Will but on the basis of the wrong understanding of an inapplicable Judgment of this Court \u2013 High Court overlooked the fact that in a civil dispute, the First Appellate Court is a final Court of fact and law and the High Court\u2019s interference u/s.100 is only on a substantial question of law \u2013 Once the First Appellate Court had found that the recitals contained in the Will clearly conveyed full ownership, there was no occasion for the High Court to go into s.14 of the Hindu Succession Act at all \u2013 Further, the First Appellate Court was concerned with two regularfirst appeals, one filed by the defendants (R.C.A No. 408 of 1986) and another filed by the appellant / plaintiff no.1 (R.C.A No. 416 of 1986) \u2013 First Appellate Court dismissed R.C.A No.408 of 1986 and allowed R.C.A No. 416 of 1986 \u2013 The defendants chose to file only one second appeal and that was against the decree in RCA No. 408 of 1986 \u2013 Decree in R.C.A No. 416 of 1986 was allowed to attain finality \u2013 Even on this ground, the High Court ought to have dismissed the second appeal \u2013 Judgment of High Court set aside \u2013 Hindu Succession Act, 1956 \u2013 s.14 \u2013 Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 \u2013 s.108.
