M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Second proviso to Article 324(5) onlyenacts the protection that the Election Commissioner or RegionalCommissioner shall not be removed from Office except on therecommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner \u2013 There isequality otherwise, which exists between the Chief ElectionCommissioner and the Election Commissioners in various matters \u2013The argument that the Election Commissioner must be accorded thesame protection as is given to the Chief Election Commissioner,appears to be untenable, on a plain reading of Article 324(5) \u2013 Inthe context of the said provision, the words \u2018provided further\u2019 cannotbe perceived as an additional protect ion to the ElectionCommissioner \u2013 It is for Parliament acting in the constituent capacityto consider whether it would be advisable to extend the protectionto the Election Commissioners so as to safeguard and ensure theindependence of the Election Commissioners as well \u2013 Held (perAjay Rastogi, J.) Various reports have recommended that theprotection against removal available to the Chief ElectionCommissioner should be made available to the other ElectionCommissioners to ensure the independence of the ElectionCommission \u2013 Keeping in view the importance of maintaining theneutrality and independence of the office of the Election Commissionto hold free and fair election which is a sine qua non for upholdingthe democracy as enshrined in our Constitut ion, it becomesimperative to shield the appointment of Election Commissioners andto be insulated from the executive interference \u2013 It is the need of thehour and advisable, to extend the protection available to the ChiefElection Commissioner under the first proviso to Article 324(5) toother Election Commissioners as well until any law is being framedby the Parliament \u2013 The conditions of service of the ElectionCommissioners shall not be varied to his disadvantage afterappointment \u2013 Election Commission (Conditions of Service ofElection Commissioners and Transaction of Business) Act, 1991.Election Laws: Independent Permanent Secretariat forElection Commission \u2013 Expenditure on the Consolidated Fund ofIndia \u2013 Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself, Aniruddha Bose,Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar): It is a matter of policy \u2013 TheElection Commission of India is to perform the arduous andunenviable task of remaining aloof from all forms of subjugationby and interference from the Executive \u2013 The Executive can bringan otherwise independent Body to its knees, by starving it off or cutting off the requisite financial wherewithal and resources requiredfor its efficient and independent functioning \u2013 One cannot beoblivious to the need for articulation of details in regard to theexpenditure, which is a matter of policy - Urgent need to providefor a permanent Secretariat and also to provide that the expenditurebe charged on the Consolidated Fund of India \u2013 It is for the Unionof India to seriously consider bringing in the much-needed change\u2013 Union of India /Parliament may consider bringing in the necessarychanges so that the Election Commission of India becomes trulyindependent.Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 326 \u2013 Representation of the PeopleAct, 1951 \u2013 s.62 \u2013 Right to Vote \u2013 Nature of Right \u2013 Whether StatutoryRight or Constitutional Right \u2013 Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C.T. Ravikumar, JJ.): The rightto vote is not a civil right \u2013 The Right to Vote inevitably follows fromthe inclusion of a person in the electoral roll \u2013 According to Art.326, where the citizen is not less than eighteen years and does nothave the disqualifications, he becomes entitled to be entered in theelectoral roll \u2013 Such person, as is indicated in Article 326, indeed,has a right, which can be said to be a Constitutional Right, whichmay be right subject to the restriction \u2013 Held (Ajay Rastogi, J.) \u2013 Byvirtue of Article 326, the right to vote became a constitutional rightgranted to citizens \u2013 The said right was given effect by s.62 ofRepresentation of the People (ROP) Act, 1951 \u2013 The right to vote isnot just a statutory right \u2013 The right to vote is an expression of thechoice of the citizen, which is a fundamental right under Art.19(1)(a)\u2013 The right to vote is not limited only to Art.326, but flows throughArts.15, 17, 19, 21 \u2013 The right to vote in direct elections is afundamental right, subject to limitations laid down in Art. 326 \u2013The right to vote is not merely a constitutional right, but a componentof Part III of the Constitution.Election Laws: Constitution of India \u2013 Art.14 \u2013 Rule of Law \u2013Role of Election Commission \u2013 Held (per K. M. Joseph, J.) (for himself,Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy and C. T. Ravikumar, JJ.): Rule oflaw is the very bedrock of a democratic form of governance \u2013 AnElection Commission which does not ensure free and fair poll asper the rules of the game, guarantees the breakdown of thefoundation of the rule of law \u2013 Any action or omission by the Election Commission in holding the poll which treats political partieswith an uneven hand and in an unfair or arbitrary manner wouldbe anathema to the mandate of Article 14, and therefore, cause itsbreach.Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 142 \u2013 Power of the Court to laydown guidelines in order to fill legislative gaps \u2013 Held (per AjayRastogi, J.): The Supreme Court has plenary power under Article142 to issue directions to do \u201ccomplete justice\u201d \u2013 The Court hascreated a jurisprudence, where it has exercised its power underArticle 142 to fill legislative gaps \u2013 Supreme Court has laid downguidelines in order to fill the legislative gap on a number ofoccasions \u2013 Series of case laws authoritatively demonstrate thecommitment of Supreme Court to intervene to preserve and promotethe \u201cRule of Law\u201d, by supplementing the legislative gaps till theLegislature steps in."

M. Joseph, J. (for himself and forAniruddha Bose, J.)] : An instrument, which is exigible to stampduty, may contain an Arbitration Clause and which is not stamped,cannot be said to be a contract, which is enforceable in law withinthe meaning of s.2(h) of the Contract Act and is not enforceableunder s.2(g) of the Contract Act \u2013 An unstamped instrument, whenit is required to be stamped, being not a contract and not enforceablein law, cannot, therefore, exist in law \u2013 The true intention behindthe insertion of s.11(6A) in the Act was to confine the Court, actingunder s.11, to examine and ascertain about the existence of anArbitration Agreement \u2013 The Scheme permits the Court, under s.11of the Act, acting on the basis of the original agreement or on acertified copy \u2013The certified copy must, however, clearly indicatethe stamp duty paid \u2013 If it does not do so, the Court should not acton such a certified copy \u2013 If the original of the instrument isproduced and it is unstamped, the Court, acting under s.11, is dutyboundto act under s.33 of the Stamp Act \u2013 When it does so, theother provisions, which, in the case of the payment of the duty andpenalty would culminate in the certificate under s.42(2) of the Stamp Act, would also apply \u2013 When such a stage arises, the Court will befree to process the Application as per law \u2013 An Arbi trationAgreement, within the meaning of s.7 of the Act, which attracts stampduty and which is not stamped or insufficiently stamped, cannot beacted upon, in view of s.35 of the Stamp Act, unless followingimpounding and payment of the requisite duty, necessary certificateis provided under s.42 of the Stamp Act \u2013 The provisions of s.33and the bar under s.35 of the Stamp Act, applicable to instrumentschargeable to stamp duty under s.3 read with the Schedule to theStamp Act, would render the Arbitration Agreement contained insuch instrument as being non-existent in law unless the instrumentis validated under the Stamp Act \u2013 Held (per C. T. Ravikumar, J.)(concurring): Being unstamped or insufficiently stamped, theagreement would not be available to be \u2018admitted in evidence\u2019 and\u2018to be acted upon\u2019, till it is validated following the proceduresprescribed under the provisions of the Stamp Act and till then, itwould not exist \u2018in law\u2019 \u2013 When the original document carrying thearbitration clause is produced and if it is found that it is unstampedor insufficiently stamped, the Court acting under s.11 is duty boundto act u/s.33 of the Indian Stamp Act \u2013 Held (per Ajay Rastogi, J.)(dissenting): The existence of a copy/certified copy of an arbitrationagreement whether unstamped/insufficiently stamped at the prereferralstage is an enforceable document for purposes ofappointment of an Arbitrator under s.11(6A) of the Act, 1996 wherethe judicial intervention shall be minimal confined only to the primafacie examination of \u201cexistence of an arbitration agreement\u201d alonekeeping in view the object of 2015 amendment and the courts muststrictly adhere to the time schedule for appointment of Arbitratorprescribed under s.11(13) of the Act, 1996 \u2013 All the preliminary /debatable issues including insufficiently stamped/unduly stampedor validity of the arbitration agreement etc. are referrable to theArbitrator/Arbitral Tribunal under s.16 of the Act, 1996 which, byvirtue of the Doctrine of Kompetenz - Kompetenz has the power todo so \u2013 Held (per Hrishikesh Roy, J.) (dissenting): The examinationof stamping and impounding need not be done at the threshold by aCourt, at the pre-reference stage under s.11 of the Arbitration Act,1996 \u2013 Non-stamping /insufficient stamping of the substantivecontract/instrument would not render the arbitration agreement nonexistentin law and unenforceable /void, for the purpose of referring a matter for arbitration \u2013 An arbitration agreement should not berendered void if it is suffering stamp deficiency which is a curabledefect.."

        "HeadNote": " Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Legislative Competency of the State \u2013 Assam State legislature enacted the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004 \u2013 Said Act provides for the establishment of a regulatory authority to register the Diploma holders and to regulate their practice \u2013 State Act in conflict with Central Act (Indian Medical Council Act, 1956) \u2013 Writ Petition challenging the Constitutionality of the Act \u2013 High Court allowed the Writ petition by holding that the Act, 2004 was unconstitutional as the State Act was in conflict with the Central Act \u2013 High Court observed that the power and scope of the State to legislate under Entry 25 of List III of the Seventh Schedule is very limited and is only in respect of a field unoccupied by a Central Act \u2013 Held: Prescription of minimum standards for medical education, authority to recognise or de-recognise an institution etc., are areas over which exclusive legislative competence lies with the Parliament, under Entry 66 of List I \u2013 The State Legislatures, on the other hand, under Entry 25 of List III, possess legislative competence to legislate with respect to all other aspects of education, except determination of minimum standards and co-ordination \u2013 In view of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and the Rules and Regulations made thereunder, the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004, declared to be null and void as State Legislature not having the legislative competence to enact the said Law \u2013 The State Legislature has no legislative competence to enact a law which is in conflict with the law setting the standards of medical education in the context of modern medicine or allopathic medicine, which has been determined by Parliamentary Legislation as well as the Rules \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Seventh Schedule \u2013 List I, Entry 66 and List III, Entry 25.\n\nAssam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015 \u2013 Constitutionality of \u2013 Power of Legislature \u2013 To overrule a Judicial Decision \u2013 High Court vide the impugned order allowed Writ petition holding that the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004 enacted by the State legislature was unconstitutional as the Act was in conflict with the Central Act (Indian Medical Council Act, 1956) and State Legislature not having the legislative competence to enact the said Law \u2013 Meanwhile, the State passed the Assam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015 \u2013 Held: The Legislature cannot directly overrule a judicial decision \u2013 But when a competent Legislature retrospectively removes the substratum or foundation of a judgment to make the decision ineffective, the said exercise is a valid legislative exercise provided it does not transgress on any other constitutional limitation \u2013 The power of the sovereign legislature to legislate within its field, both prospectively and retrospectively cannot be questioned \u2013 It would be permissible for the legislature to remove a defect in earlier legislation pointed out by a constitutional court in exercise of its powers by way of judicial review \u2013 The Assam Community Professionals (Registration and Competency) Act, 2015, enacted pursuant to the judgment of the High Court, is a valid piece of Legislation as it removed the basis of the impugned judgment passed by the High Court \u2013 The 2015 Act is also not in conflict with the IMC, Act, 1956 \u2013 This is because the Central Act namely, IMC, Act, 1956 does not deal with Community Health Professionals who would practise as allopathic practitioners in the manner as they were permitted to practise under the Assam Rural Health Regulatory Authority Act, 2004, in rural areas of the State of Assam \u2013 Hence, by a separate legislation the Community Health Professionals have been permitted to practise as such professionals \u2013 The said legislation of 2015 is not in conflict with IMC, Act, 1956 and the rules and regulations made thereunder \u2013 Hence, the Act of 2015 is not hit by Entry 66 of List I of the Constitution and is within the legislative competence of the State Legislature under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nConstitution of India: Seventh Schedule \u2013 Art. 245, 246 & 254 \u2013 Interplay between Entry 66 of List I and Entry 25 of List III \u2013 Held: The question of invasion into another legislative territory has to be determined by substance and not by degree \u2013 Where one Entry is made \u2018subject to\u2019 another Entry, all that it means is that out of the scope of the former Entry, a field of legislation covered by the latter Entry has been reserved to be specially dealt with by the appropriate Legislature \u2013 The field of legislation covered under Entry 25 of List III is subject to Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I \u2013 Dual restrictions operate in the legislative competence of a State Legislature to enact any law under Entry 25 of List III \u2013 First is, if such a law is to be made by the State Legislature, it is always subject to Entries 63, 64, 65 and 66 of List I or the Union List, in respect of which only the Parliament has the power to enact a law \u2013 The second restriction is with regard to the subject of the Entry as a whole \u2013 When any law is made under Entry 25 of List III by a State Legislature, the same is always subject to Entry 66 of List I \u2013 Modern scientific medicine or allopathic medicine is within the scope of Entry 66 of List I and not under Entry 25 of List III \u2013 In the instant case the law made by the State Legislature is hit by the first of the aforesaid two restrictions \u2013 Hence, the State Legislature lacked the legislative competence to enact such a Law.
