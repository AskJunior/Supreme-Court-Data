        "HeadNote": "Service Law: All India Service \u2013 Appellant was candidate seeking appointment to All India Service pursuant to Civil Services Examination-2006 \u2013 She was successful and her name appeared at serial no.20 \u2013 Applicant, though an OBC candidate, came on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC \u2013 She was allotted Himachal Pradesh Cadre after the consent of Himachal Pradesh Government \u2013 Applicant filed O.A. before CAT (Tribunal) \u2013 The grievance of the applicant was that she had a better merit than candidate-Merit No. 26 who was allocated the Maharashtra cadre as an OBC candidate and, therefore, she should have been allocated the Maharashtra cadre \u2013 Tribunal directed the Union of India to allot and accommodate the applicant against the outsider OBC vacancy in the Maharashtra Cadre by virtue of her merit over the candidate already identified and allotted the Maharashtra Cadre \u2013 The Union and the applicant aggrieved against the said order filed writ petitions before the High Court \u2013 High Court held that five admitted deficit vacancies were required to be filled up by following the outsider-insider ratio in the given cycle of 30-point roster, then there would be an insider vacancy, to be given either to the SC/ST or the OBC \u2013 Since there was no SC/ST candidate, it had to be filled up by insider OBC, i.e., the applicant \u2013 On appeal, held: High Court has completely misread the statutory rules and the policy of allocation of cadre \u2013 The Union had prescribed a procedure to be followed in the allotment of cadre to the officers of All India Services on 30.07.1984 \u2013 All the cadres/joint cadres were divided into four groups and the 24 States were arranged in alphabetical order \u2013 Later, another procedure was circulated on 30/31.05.1985 \u2013 It is the said allocation circular which was in force at the time of cadre allocation for the year 2007 \u2013 Maharashtra, Manipur-Tripura, Nagaland, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan and Sikkim fell in Group IIIwhereas Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh fell in Group II \u2013 The applicant was allocated to the State of Himachal Pradesh and there was a consent duly given by the State of Himachal Pradesh for her allocation to that State \u2013 Therefore, mandate of r.5(1) of the Cadre Rules is satisfied when consultation was made with the State to which allocation was made \u2013 Applicant claimed allocation to the State of Kerala, i.e., her home cadre \u2013 There were 4 senior candidates in the general category \u2013 She was on merit as a general category candidate, having not availed any of the relaxed standards meant for a candidate of OBC category \u2013 In terms of proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules and the proviso to clause 16(1) in the notification inviting applications for CSE-2006, the candidates including the applicant were put to notice, that SC/ST or OBC candidates will be treated as General Category Candidates who have not availed any concession or relaxation \u2013 Applicant was thus rightly treated as General Category candidate \u2013 In terms of Clause 16(2) of the CSE-2006 notification, the candidates belonging to the SC/ST or OBC recommended against unreserved vacancies may be adjusted against reserved vacancies by the Government, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in the order of their preference \u2013 The applicant was already allocated IAS as there was no question of change of service \u2013 Therefore, as a general category candidate, there was no occasion for consultation with State of Kerala as the applicant was not even eligible to be considered for allocation to the said State in terms of the allocation order \u2013 The reasoning given by the High Court that there was cadre deficiency, therefore, the applicant was entitled to be allocated is bereft of any merit \u2013 High Court exceeded its jurisdiction to order allocation of Kerala Cadre to the applicant without examining the policy decision of the Union to fill up only 89 vacancies \u2013 High Court again erred in law that an OBC candidate, who has not availed relaxation or concession, had to be treated as general category candidate \u2013 Candidate-Merit No.26 was the first OBC candidate who had availed concessions or relaxations as OBC and was allocated to Maharashtra cadre, being the first State in Group I in the scheme of grouping of States or cadres \u2013 Therefore, the applicant had no claim appointment to the Maharashtra cadre \u2013 She had no right to the Kerala cadre as well as the second post in the vacancies in the State of Kerala was meant for an OBC outsider candidate \u2013 SinceKerala was second last State in Group IV, the OBC candidate at Serial No. 131 was allocated such cadre \u2013 Indian Administrative Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954 \u2013 r.5(1). Service Law: All India Service \u2013 CSE-2006 \u2013 Allocation of home cadre, claimed by OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC \u2013 The notification inviting applications for CSE- 2006 was in terms of r.7 of the Recruitment Rules and also the allocation circular \u2013 The proviso to clause 16(1) of the notification contemplates that if an SC/ST or OBC candidate has not availed any concessions or relaxations in the eligibility or selection criteria at any stage of the examination, and if after taking into account the general qualifying standards is found fit for recommendation by the Commission, they shall not be recommended against the vacancies reserved for SC/ST and OBC \u2013 It is sub-clause (2) of Clause 16 of CSE-2006 which gives an option to SC/ST or OBC candidate recommended against unreserved vacancies to be adjusted against reserved vacancies, if by this process they get a service of higher choice in order of their preference \u2013 Thus, an SC/ST or OBC candidate selected against unreserved vacancy as a general merit candidate cannot make a grievance in respect of allocation of cadre but has a right to seek service as a reserved category candidate if that improves the selection of service \u2013 In fact, all the candidates including the applicant were put to notice as to how the cadre allocation would be made \u2013 But still, the applicant chose to claim home state though she was not eligible to be considered for such state \u2013 She had taken chance in appearing in the selection process but when she was unsuccessful in getting the home cadre, attempts were made to get into the home cadre on wholly untenable grounds \u2013 Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 \u2013 r.7. Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954: OBC candidate, coming on general merit without resorting to the relaxed standard for the candidates belonging to OBC \u2013 Entitlement to OBC reserved seat in her State \u2013 Held: r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules contemplates that the candidate belonging to the SC/ST or OBC found suitable by the Commission for appointment to the service \u201cshall be appointed against unreserved vacancies\u201d in case they qualify for appointment to the service based on their merit without recourse to the benefit of reservation \u2013 Such provision in the rule isa consonance with the judgment of this Court in Indra Sawhney and Ors. v. Union of India and Ors. \u2013 r.7(4) is to be read as a proviso to r.7(3) of the Recruitment Rules which permits the appointment of candidates of SC/ST or OBC against the vacancies reserved for such candidates \u201cwith due regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration\u201d \u2013 Therefore, if a SC/ST or OBC candidate who has been found suitable for appointment against the unreserved vacancies can be appointed against the vacancy reserved for SC/ ST or OBC, provided a conscious decision is taken with regard to the maintenance of efficiency of administration \u2013 The applicant though belonging to OBC has not availed any relaxations or concessions admissible to OBC candidates \u2013 She was a general merit candidate, thus not entitled to OBC reserved seat in her State \u2013 She was allocated to Himachal Pradesh cadre as a general category candidate falling in r.7(3) in view of her merit position as a general category candidate. A Service Jurisprudence: Allotment of cadre is an incidence of service \u2013 The applicant as a candidate for the All-India Service with eyes wide open has opted to serve anywhere in the country \u2013 Once an applicant gets selected to service, the scramble for the home cadre starts \u2013 The procedure for allocation of cadre is a mechanical process and admits no exception except in terms of r.7(4) which is to be read as proviso to r.7(3) \u2013 The State has no discretion of allocation of a cadre at its whims and fancies \u2013 Therefore, the Tribunal or the High Court should have refrained from interfering with the allocation of cadre on the argument of alleged violation of the allocation circular \u2013 Indian Administrative Service (Recruitment) Rules, 1954 \u2013 r.7(3) \u2013 Service law."

and (ii) the detaining authority shall afford to the person detained \u201cthe earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order\u201d \u2013 Both these procedural requirements are mutually reinforcing \u2013 The communication, as soon as may be, of the grounds of detention is intended to inform the detenu of the basis on which the order of detention has been made \u2013 The expression \u201cas soon as may be\u201d imports a requirement of immediacy \u2013 The communication of the grounds is in aid of facilitating the right of the detenu to submit a representation against the order of detention \u2013 The significance of Art.22 is that the representation which has been submitted by the detenu must be disposed of at an early date.National Security Act, 1980: s.3(4) \u2013 Report to the State Government \u2013 Held: Once an order of detention is made, the officer making the order must forthwith report the fact to the State Government, together with the grounds on which the order has been made and other particulars which have a bearing on the matter.National Security Act, 1980: s.8(1) \u2013 Communication of grounds of detention \u2013 Requirment of immediacy \u2013 Held: s.8(1) uses the expression \u201cas soon as may be\u201d, qualifying it with the requirement that the communication of grounds should ordinarily not be later than five days and, in exceptional circumstances, for reasons to be recorded in writing not later than ten days from the date of detention \u2013 s.8(1) also embodies the second requirement of Art.22(5) of affording to the detenu the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order to the appropriate government \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art.22(5).ational Security Act, 1980: s.8 \u2013 Delay in considering the representation \u2013 The requirement under s.8 of the disclosure and communication of the grounds of detention and the affording of an opportunity to the detenu of making a representation against such an order to the appropriate government, is distinct from the reference to the Advisory Board \u2013 In the instant case, in spite of awaiting the receipt of the report of the Advisory Board which was eventually issued on 15 June 2021, the State Government took another one month in arriving at a decision on the appellant\u2019s representation dated 18 May 2021 \u2013 By delaying its decision on the representation, the State Government deprived the detenu of the valuable right which emanates from the provisions of s.8(1) of having the representation being considered expeditiously \u2013 The communication of the grounds of detention to the detenu \u201cas soon as may be\u201d and the affording to the detenu of the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order of detention to the appropriate government are intended to ensure that the representation of the detenu is considered by the appropriate government with a sense of immediacy \u2013 The State Government failed to do so \u2013 The making of a reference to the Advisory Board could not have furnished any justification for the State Government to not deal with the representation independently at the earliest \u2013 The delay by the State Government in disposing of the representation and by the Central and State Government in communicating such rejection, strikes at the heart of the procedural rights and guarantees granted to the detenu \u2013 The law provides for such procedural safeguards to balance the wide powers granted to the executive under the NSA \u2013 State Government cannot expect this Court to uphold its powers of subjective satisfaction to detain a person, while violating the procedural guarantees of the detenu that are fundamental to the laws of preventive detention enshrined in the Constitution.National Security Act, 1980: Failure to communicate decision on the representation \u2013 Art.22(4), in guaranteeing a right to make a representation to the detenu creates a corresponding duty on the State machinery to render this right meaningful \u2013 The detenu\u2019s right to make a representation and for it to be considered expeditiously would ring hollow without a corollary right of the detenu to receive a timely communication from the appropriate government on the status of its representation- be it an acceptance or a rejection \u2013Failure in timely communication of the rejection of representation is a relevant factor for determining the delay that the detenu is protected against under Art.22(5) \u2013 Failure of the Central and the State Government to communicate the rejection of the appellant\u2019s representation in a time-bound manner is sufficient to vitiate the order of detention."

Liability: Vicarious liability \u2013 A company being a juristic person cannot be imprisoned, but it can be subjected to a fine, which in itself is a punishment \u2013 Every punishment has adverse consequences, and therefore, prosecution of the company is mandatory \u2013 Minimum Wages Act, 1948."

        "HeadNote": "Transfer of Property Act: s.54 \u2013 Case of plaintiff-appellant was that he had executed a power of attorney in favour of his brother \u2013 Acting on the basis of power of attorney, his brother executed two sale deeds \u2013 The first sale deed was executed in favour of his sons and the other in favour of his wife \u2013 Plaintiff filed two suits \u2013 One was against his brother and his minor sons and the other was against his brother and his wife \u2013 Defence of defendant-brother was that he was in muscat and earning well and remitting money to his brother to purchase properties in his name \u2013 However, while purchasing the properties, plaintiff had got his name incorporated as joint purchaser \u2013 Trial court accepted the case of defendant and dismissed the suit \u2013 First appellate court partly allowed the appeal holding that both the brothers were joint purchaser \u2013 High Court upheld the view that both the brothers were joint owners of suit properties and the suits for declaration of invalidty of the sale deeds were barred by limitation and the sale considerations mentioned in the sale deeds executed in 1981 of Rs.5500 and Rs.6875 were not exhorbitant and the amounts were not out of reach of the sons and wife of defendant-brother \u2013 On appeal, held: The modified decree passed by High Court on the basis of the finding that the plaintiff and defendant-brother were the joint owners of the suit properties as the defendant-brother failed to establish his claim that he was the sole owner of the suit properties \u2013 Defendants did not challenge the impugned judgment and therefore, the finding that the plaintiff and defendant-brother were the joint owners of the suit properties has become final \u2013 Admittedly, there is no evidence adduced on record by defendant-brother that his minor sons and his wife had any source of income at the relevant time and that they paid him consideration as mentioned in the sale deed \u2013 There is a categorical finding recorded by trial court that defendant-brother by takingadvantage of the power of attorney, transferred the suit lands to his own minor sons and his wife without any consideration \u2013 High Court did not disturb the finding recorded by trial court regarding the failure of the defendants to adduce evidence regarding the payment of consideration under the sale deeds \u2013 High Court merely observed that the sale consideration of Rs.5,500/- and Rs.6,875/- was not exorbitant and was not out of reach of minor sons and wife \u2013 High Court ignored that it was considering a case of sale deeds of the year 1981 and that the purchasers under one of two sale deeds were minor and it was not even pleaded that they had any source of income \u2013 The same was the case with the sale deed executed in favour of his wife \u2013 Thus, defendants-respondents failed to adduce any evidence to prove that the minor sons and wife had any source of income and that they had paid the consideration payable under the sale deed. Transfer of Property Act: s.54 \u2013 Sale without consideration \u2013 A sale of an immovable property has to be for a price \u2013 The price may be payable in future \u2013 It may be partly paid and the remaining part can be made payable in future \u2013 The payment of price is an essential part of a sale covered by s.54 of the TP Act \u2013 If a sale deed in respect of an immovable property is executed without payment of price and if it does not provide for the payment of price at a future date, it is not a sale at all in the eyes of law \u2013 Therefore, such a sale will be void \u2013 It will not effect the transfer of the immovable property \u2013 It is the specific case made out in the plaints as originally filed that the sale deeds are void as the same are without consideration \u2013 It is pleaded that the same are sham as the purchasers who were minor sons and wife had no earning capacity \u2013 No evidence was adduced by defendant-brother about the payment of the price mentioned in the sale deeds as well as the earning capacity at the relevant time of his wife and minor sons \u2013 Hence, the sale deeds will have to be held as void being executed without consideration \u2013 Hence, the sale deeds did not affect in any manner one half share of the appellant in the suit properties \u2013 In fact, such a transaction made by defendant-brother of selling the suit properties on the basis of the power of attorney to his own wife and minor sons is a sham transaction \u2013 It was not necessary for the plaintiff to specifically claim a declaration as regards the sale deeds by way of amendment to the plaint \u2013 The reason being that there were specificpleadings in the plaints as originally filed that the sale deeds were void \u2013 A document which is void need not be challenged by claiming a declaration as the said plea can be set up and proved even in collateral proceedings \u2013 Hence, the issue of bar of limitation of the prayers for declaration incorporated by way of an amendment does not arise at all \u2013 As no title was transferred under the said sale deeds, the plaintiff continues to have undivided half share in the suit properties \u2013 Decree passed by trial court that the plaintiff is entitled to joint possession of the suit properties along with his defendant-brother is restored."

        "HeadNote": "Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (Reservation of Offices of Mayors) Rules, 2006 \u2013 r. 3(2) \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Art. 243T \u2013 Maharashtra Municipal Corporations Act, 1949 \u2013 s. 19A \u2013 Reservation of offices for the election of Mayor \u2013 Issuance of Notification whereby Office of Mayor in Dhule Municipal Corporation for the term commencing from June, 2021 reserved for Backward Class category \u2013 Writ petition by respondent no.1 challenging the said Notification and sought direction to reserve the post of Mayor of the said Corporation for the next term for Scheduled Caste category \u2013 Notification set aside by the High Court holding that since already on two earlier occasions, the Office of Mayor of the said Corporation was reserved for Backward Class, coupled with the fact that there has been no reservation for the Scheduled Caste category, amounted to violation of rotation policy \u2013 On appeal, held: Rules of 2006 are mechanism for giving effect to the constitutional mandate u/Art. 243T of providing reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the enabling provision for providing reservation for Backward Class of Citizens in proportion to their population \u2013 Combined reading of the said Rules along with the Art. 243T and s. 19(1A) would not permit the interpretation as placed by the High Court \u2013 Taking into consideration the fact that the number of seats reserved for Scheduled Castes are 3 whereas for Backward Class are 7 i.e. more than twice, it is quite probable that the post of Mayor could be reserved for two earlier terms for Backward Class and whereas no reservation is provided for Scheduled Castes \u2013 Dominant purpose and the legislative intent of r. 3 is to provide reservation in proportion of the population of such categories in the Municipal areas and also to ensure that while all the eligible Corporations get reservation at some point of time for the different categories, at the same time there would be no repetition of reservation until the rotation is complete \u2013 Legislative intent is to exclude the Corporations which were earlier reserved for a particular category until all the categories are provided reservation \u2013 However, while doing so, the Court will have to interpret r. 3 in such a manner that this scheme is made workable and not frustrated. Interpretation of statutes: Cardinal principle of construction of a statute \u2013 Held: Duty of the Court is to construe the Statute as a whole \u2013 One provision of the Act is to be construed with reference to other provisions so as to make a consistent enactment of the whole Statute \u2013 Provisions which appear to be in conflict with each other are to be constructed so as to harmonise them \u2013 While interpreting a particular statutory provision, it should not result into making the other provision a \u201cdead letter\u201d \u2013 Furthermore, the court needs to ascertain the intention of the law-making authority in the backdrop of dominant purpose and the intendment of the Statute \u2013 Court will have to prefer an interpretation which makes the Statute workable and gives effect to the intention of the legislature than the one which defeats the purpose of the enactment."

        "HeadNote": "Judgment/Order: Reasoned judgment \u2013 Requirment to give reasons in the judgment/order \u2013 Grievance of the appellants is that the reasoning for the impugned judgment was given and published long after its operative portion was pronounced \u2013 The operative portion of the judgment was pronounced on 27.06.2019 \u2013 The reasons were published on 05.10.2020 \u2013 Held: High Court\u2019s conduct in not furnishing reasons, either at the time of pronouncement of the operative part of the judgment, or before the commencement of the next working day (of the court) strongly deprecated \u2013 Judicial deprecation. Public interest litigation: Impugned judgment passed in writ petition filed as Public interest litigation (PIL) challenged by the appellants on the ground that the PIL was motivated \u2013 Held: There is no doubt, that PIL is meant to be entertained, for bona fide causes, and not to aid either misguided individuals in their quest for publicity, or for wreaking vendetta on public officials or institutions \u2013 The cause espoused by the writ petitioners was undoubtedly one of public interest, because it concerned housing for the economically disadvantaged sections of society, in such great numbers \u2013 The scheme was meant to benefit thousands of persons, and over a thousand housing units were to be constructed and allotted to the beneficiaries \u2013 In view of the inquiries and the reports, conducted and prepared during the proceedings, the initiation of public interest proceedings, were justified, having regard to the contents of such reports \u2013 Even if the public interest litigants\u2019 motives were ambiguous, or not immediately bona fide, that could not have led to dismissal of the writ petition, before the High Court \u2013 The objection as to lack of standing of the public interest litigants, therefore, is without merit \u2013 Housing.Public interest litigation: Housing scheme \u2013 Allegations of failure and neglect on the part of the municipal authorities in regard to completion of the scheme \u2013 In the criminal public interest litigation, the respondents (PIL petitioners) sought directions to the Union of India, the State of Maharashtra, the Maharashtra Housing and Urban Development Authority (MHADA) and state officials to initiate criminal proceedings against the responsible officers and office bearers of Municipal Council, Naldurg and concerned contractors for misappropriation of government funds in implementation of the housing scheme in the municipality \u2013 The PIL petitioners had alleged the utter mismanagement in terms of which as many as 1.05 lakh dwelling units were to be constructed and handed over to the eligible individuals \u2013 The scheme contemplated a substantial funding by the central government and the rest of the funding to be borne by the allottees \u2013 As against the targeted 1206 housing units to be constructed, 737 beneficiaries belonged to the reserved category and the rest to the general category \u2013 Inspection reports and affidavits of MHADA as well as the Divisional Commissioner revealed that only 302 housing units were constructed in different localities in Naldurg, of which 202 could be used and 100 were in an unusable and dilapidated condition \u2013 The affidavits filed on behalf of authorities revealed that excess payments of ` 1,52,81,846/- and ` 90,97,771/- were made \u2013 After taking note of affidavit of the Commissioner, High Court disposed of PILs directing the respondents to take steps in light of the reports, and action outlined in the affidavit, \u201cto its logical end\u201d as expeditiously as possible \u2013 In the instant appeal, the main argument of the appellant was that criminal proceedings were initiated against them even though they were not heard in the public interest proceedings, and that being adverse to them the judgment was vitiated on account of their non-participation \u2013 Held: High Court had not by itself directed initiation of investigation nor did it direct registration of an FIR \u2013 High Court had directed respondents to take steps in light of their reports, and action outlined in the affidavit, \u201cto its logical end\u201d \u2013 The material on record before the High Court in the form of inspection report and further materials including the Divisional Commissioner\u2019s affidavit, showed irregularities of a severe nature \u2013 The constructions, according to the reports, were sub-standard in respect of 100 such houses, so severe that the units were unusable\u2013 The main objective of providing housing to 1206 eligible and deserving families remained unfulfilled despite expenditure of substantial amounts \u2013 In the circumstances, the argument of the appellants that they ought to have been heard even before action was initiated, does not commend to this Court; it is not sound \u2013 There were materials suggesting serious irregularities \u2013 The government allowed the Divisional Commissioner to affirm in the affidavit filed by him that criminal proceedings would be initiated \u2013 In such circumstances, the observations of the High Court to take the matter to the logical end have to be, therefore, construed in that context \u2013 Whether the allegations are true or whether the submissions on behalf of the petitioners justified their conduct or omission is something upon which the High Court could not and correctly did not comment \u2013 As far as the FIR itself was concerned, the police had no choice given the imperative nature of the law declared in Lalita Kumari where a preliminary enquiry ordinarily is to be eschewed whenever cognizable offences are reported \u2013 Thus, the impugned order not interfered with."

Evidence Act, 1872 \u2013 ss. 91 and 92 \u2013 Discussed and explained."

Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 193 \u2013 Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013 Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 \u2013 Cognizance of the offence and not the offender \u2013 The Special Judge by an order mentions that cognizance is taken against the accused \u2013 Whether merely because the cognizance order mentions that cognizance is taken against the \u2018accused\u2019, the entire proceedings would be vitiated \u2013 Held : It is a settled principle of law that cognizance is taken of the offence and not the offender \u2013 However, the cognizance order indicates that the Special Judge has perused all the relevant material relating to the case before cognizance was taken \u2013 The change in the form of the order would not alter its effect \u2013 The order taking cognizance inadvertently mentioned that the Special Judge has taken cognizance against the accused instead of the offence \u2013 This would not vitiate the entire proceedings. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013 Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 ss. 193, 220 \u2013 Penal Code, 1860 \u2013 Cognizance by the Special Court of the offences under IPC \u2013 It was contended that even if the Special Judge had the power to take cognizance of the offence, he could only have taken cognizance of offences under the MMDR Act and could not have taken cognizance (and conduct trial) of the offences under the provisions of IPC \u2013 Held : Since offences under IPC are alleged to have been committed in the course of the same transaction as the offences under the MMDR Act, the situation is squarely covered by sub-section (1) of s.220 of CrPC \u2013 The Special Court has the power to take cognizance of offences under MMDR Act and conduct a joint trial with other offences if permissible u/s. 220 CrPC \u2013 There is no express provision in the MMDR Act which indicates that s.220 CrPC does not apply to proceedings under the MMDR Act. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013 Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 s. 193 \u2013 Cognizance order and non-application of mind \u2013 Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department \u2013 FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted \u2013 Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report \u2013 It was contended that the order of the Special Judge taking cognizance has not sufficiently demonstrated application of mind to the material placed before him \u2013 Held : The Special Judge, took cognizance on the basis of a report submitted u/s. 173 CrPC and not on the basis of a private complaint \u2013 The Special Judge took note of the FIR, the witness statements, and connected documents before taking cognizance of the offence \u2013 In this backdrop, it would be far-fetched to fault the order of the Special Judge on the ground that it does not adduce detailed reasons for taking cognizance or that it does not indicate that an application of mind. Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 \u2013 s.22 \u2013 Karnataka Forest Rules, 1969 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department \u2013 FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted \u2013 Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report \u2013 Appellant contended that before the Special Court (Sessions Court) took cognizance of the offence, no complaint was filed by the authorised person \u2013 Held : A combined reading of the notifications dated 29 May 2014 and 21 January 2014 indicate that the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta is an authorized person for the purpose of s.22 of the MMDR Act \u2013 The FIR that was filed to overcome the bar u/s. 22 has been signed by the Sub-Inspector of Lokayukta Police and the information was given by the SIT \u2013 Therefore, the respondent had complied with s.22 MMDR Act. Procedure, 1973 \u2013 Vicarious liability \u2013 Allegations of purchasing and selling extracted iron ore illegally without mining dispatch permits and the payments of charges to the Mining and Geological Departments and the Forest Department \u2013 FIR registered and a final report u/s. 173 of Cr.P.C. submitted \u2013 Additional City and Civil Sessions Judge and Special Judge took cognizance after perusing the final report \u2013 It was contended that the charge- sheet does not ascribe any role to A-1 and hence the process initiated against him must be quashed \u2013 Held : The determination of whether the conditions stipulated in s.23 of the MMDR Act have been fulfilled is a matter of trial \u2013 Moreover, it is evident that the charge sheet, as a matter of fact, ascribes a role to A-1 and A-2 for the payment of transportation \u2013 Therefore, there is a prima facie case against A-1, which is sufficient to arraign him as an accused at this stage."

SARFAESI Act : ss.13(2) and (4) \u2013 Failure of Borrower to repay loan as per payment schedule \u2013 Loans declared NPA \u2013 Notice issued by Bank under s.13(2) calling upon Borrower to discharge its liability \u2013 However, Borrower neither made any payment nor responded by way of reply \u2013 Thereafter, Borrower wrote letter in which while accepting defaults and non payment enlisted reasons for not being able to adhere to payment schedule and requested to grant further moratorium \u2013 Bank granted further moratorium and deferred action under SARFAESI Act to enable Borrower to submit detailed project/viability report \u2013 Borrower failed to fulfill promise made \u2013 Post this default also there were negotiations with assurances and promises by the Borrower \u2013 Displaying forbearance, the Bank granted indulgence as action under the SARFAESI Act was deferred for nearly one year \u2013 Thereafter Bank issued notice under s.13(4) and took symbolic possession of subject property \u2013 After several attempts to auction the property, fourth attempt was successful and property was sold and sale certificate issued \u2013 Before auction, Borrower was given notice of auction \u2013 Thereafter borrower filed petition before DRT challenging the enforcement proceedings in respect of the subject property including all steps taken right from issue of notice under s.13(2) of the SARFAESI Act \u2013 DRT dismissed borrower \u2019s application \u2013 Borrower preferred writ petition \u2013 Meanwhile auction purchaser sold the property to second purchaser \u2013 High Court held that the Borrower can challenge the possession notice, taking of symbolic possession notice, taking of physical possession, sale notice and sale certificate as they all form part of the same cause of action \u2013 High Court concluded that compliance with s.13(3A) being mandatory, Bank had failed to respond with reasons to the representations made by the Borrower \u2013 Instant appeal filed by second purchaser \u2013 Held : It is correct that waiver being an intentional relinquishment is not to be inferred by mere failure to take action, but the instant case is of repeated positive acts post the notices under ss.13(2) and (4) of the SARFAESI Act \u2013 Not only did the Borrower not question or object to the action of the Bank, but it by express and deliberate conduct had asked the Bank to compromise its position and alter the contractual terms \u2013 The Borrower wrote repeated request letters for restructuring of loans, which prayers were considered by the Bank by giving indulgence, time and opportunities \u2013 The Borrower, aware and conscious of its rights, chose to abandon the statutory claim and took its chance and even procured favourable decisions \u2013 Borrower\u2019s conduct had put the Bank in a position where they have lost time, and suffered on account of delay and laches, which aspects are material \u2013 Action on the subject property was delayed by more than a year as at the behest of the Borrower, the Bank gave them a long rope to regularise the account \u2013 To ignore the conduct of the Borrower would not be reasonable to the Bank once third party rights have been created \u2013 In this background, the principle of equitable estoppel as a rule of evidence bars the Borrower from complaining of violation \u2013 The Borrower challenged the actions taken by the Bank after the Subject Property had changed hands and third party interests had been created \u2013 Thus, the Borrower waived and is estopped from challenging violation of s.13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act. Judgment/Order: Remedy/relief \u2013 Grant of, scope \u2013 Held: Power of the courts/judicial authorities to mould relief \u2013 While holding that the general approach is that the claimant who succeeds in establishing the unlawfulness of administrative action is entitled to grant of remedial order, the general proposition does not undermine the discretion which the courts or judicial authorities have in assessing \u201cwhat is fair and just to do in the particular case to withhold the remedy altogether or to mould the remedy by grant of a declaration rather than a more coercive quashing, prohibiting or mandatory order or injunction which may have been sought\u201d \u2013 Relief may be granted in respect of one aspect and not others \u2013 The general approach, therefore, is that a complainant who succeeds in establishing unlawfulness of an action is entitled to a remedial order, but the court has discretion in the sense of determining what is fair and just to do in a particular case."

BSF Rules 1969 \u2013 Unamended r.51 and amended r.51 (amendement in 2011) \u2013 Effect of amendment in r.51 \u2013 Clarificatory nature \u2013 The complainant, a Constable in the BSF, was on Naka duty between 02:00 to 06:00 hours on the night intervening 16 and 17 April 2006 when the respondent-Head Constable is alleged to have committed an act of sexual assault on him \u2013 Record of Evidence (RoE) was submitted to the Commandant \u2013 The Commandant noted that there was an inconsistency in the statements of the witnesses as regards the date on which the incident had occurred and ordered an additional RoE \u2013 Whether the commandant prior to the amendment of r.51 in 2011 had jurisdiction to direct preparation of an additional RoE \u2013 Held: When an amendment is purely clarificatory or declaratory in nature, it is deemed to operate retrospectively \u2013 The fact that the incident took place in the present case prior to the date of the amendment, i.e., 25.11.2011, would make no difference once the amendment, in the true sense of the expression, is construed to be clarificatory in nature \u2013 Against this backdrop, the Commandant was acting within his jurisdiction in ordering an additional RoE to clarify the date of the incident. Interpretation of Statutes \u2013 Amendment to a statute \u2013 Clarificatory nature \u2013 Held: An amendment to a statute or to statutory rules may often be clarificatory in nature \u2013 It is clarificatory in thesense that it expressly recognizes a power that already vests in the authority \u2013 In those circumstances, when an amendment is purely clarificatory or declaratory in nature, it is deemed to operate retrospectively. Service Law \u2013 Highlighting a rising trend of invalidation of proceedings inquiring into sexual misconduct, on hyper-technical interpretations of the applicable service rules \u2013 Discussed"
