Public Services (Tribunal) Act, 1976 \u2013 s.5 \u2013 Right to Information Act, 2005. Service Law \u2013 Judicial approach in service matters \u2013 Held: Undue sympathy and a perceived liberal approach by a judicial forum can lead to significant adverse consequences \u2013 It not only gives rise to illegitimate expectations in the mind of fence sitting employees, but also leads to undue burdens on the public exchequer \u2013 Indulgence shown by a Court solely on equitable considerations, dehors the law, breeds indiscipline in public services and incorrigible employees start looking for a dividend on the period of their absence or for dereliction of duty. Service Law \u2013 Service disputes \u2013 Appropriate forum \u2013 Held: State Information Commission is not a forum to adjudicate service disputes \u2013 Right to Information Act, 2005."

Acquisition of land, in absence of environmental clearance \u2013 Permissibility of \u2013 Plea that two companies did not have any Environmental Clearance, in the absence of which the land could not have been acquired for setting up the plant \u2013 Held : No objection can be raised that there is no environmental clearance certificate from the Ministry of Environment and Forest as the same has already been issued on 23.09.2016. Land acquisition, if vitiated for non-application of mind and undue haste by competent authorities \u2013 Held : No grounds were raised nor any foundation laid in the petitions alleging mala fide \u2013 Object of the 2002 Act was primarily to provide a Single Window Clearance by the High Level Committees constituted under the 2002 Act \u2013 Reports and recommendations of the different Committees as also the State Government have been gone through \u2013 Found that all aspects of the matter have been considered and a conscious decision has been taken on the overall conspectus of the project and the proposals submitted. s. 3(1), 1(3), 28(1) \u2013 Procedure prescribed to acquire land under \u2013 Duly followed or not \u2013 Held: Entire process as provided under the Act has been strictly followed \u2013 Division Bench in the impugned judgment apparently was swayed by its own personal views based on assumptions and having no material backing which led to the quashing of the notifications. ss. 28, 41 \u2013 Allotment of plots in special cases \u2013 Land Acquisition for single company, if can be said to be for public purpose and could be made under 1966 Act \u2013 Held : Under the Regulation 13, the Board is empowered to allot any plot or area to any individual or company for establishment of an industry in consultation with the State Government \u2013 This provision also contemplates acquiring land for the purpose of allotment to a single company to set up an industry \u2013 In the instant case, the allotment by the Board is duly approved by the State Government. Land acquisition for a non\u2013applicant company under the Act, without its application being routed through State High Level Clearance Committee \u2013 Permissibility of \u2013 Held : Non\u2013applicant company is fully owned subsidiary of the applicant company \u2013 Only change sought by the applicant was the integrated steel plant be set up by non-applicant which was its own subsidiary \u2013 These are commercial matters and the State after examining the proposal for change in its wisdom accepted the same \u2013 There was no change in the project, as such, regarding the finance, employment and other infrastructures \u2013 Thus, the said objection not maintainable. Reliance on Shri Ramtanu Coop. Housing Society Ltd. vs. State of Maharashtra\u2019s case for the proposition that the acquisition under the 1966 Act was in pari materia to the Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1962 and, thus, the acquisition has to be for public purpose only and not for a private company \u2013 Correctness of \u2013 Held : Validity of the 1962 Act was being considered in the case of Shri Ramtanu \u2013 However, in the present litigation, there is no challenge to the validity of the 1966 Act or the 2002 Act \u2013 Purpose in 1962 Act was for establishment of industrial areas whereas in the other statute i.e 1966 Act, it was for promotion of the establishment and orderly development of industries \u2013 Thus, the reliance by the Division Bench in the impugned judgment on the case of Shri Ramtanu is misplaced \u2013 Maharashtra Industrial Development Act, 1962. Value judgments of policy views \u2013 Significance of \u2013 Conclusions arrived at in the impugned judgment, if vitiated on account of inclusion of value judgments of policy views by the High Court \u2013 Held : Division Bench introduced several value judgments and policy views in order to interpret the provisions of the 1966 Act and the 2002 Act \u2013 Such value judgments and policy views are beyond the domain of the Court \u2013 Courts should refrain itself from expressing value judgments and policy views in order to interpret statutes \u2013 Statutes are to be read in their plain language and not otherwise \u2013 Interpretation of Statutes. Petition for quashing the land acquisition by a fraction of landowners holding a fraction of acquired land which is only 10 % or less of the total acquired land \u2013 Maintainability of \u2013 Held : Quashing the entire acquisition at the instance of one land owner having 4.34 acres of land out of total acquisition for applicant company of 110 acres, would be against the public policy and public interest \u2013 Further, in the case of non-applicant company acquisition of 914 acres is challenged by a fraction of less than 10% land owners \u2013 Hence, Division Bench erred in quashing the acquisition proceedings. Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Act, 1966 \u2013 Karnataka Industries (Facilitation) Act, 2002 \u2013 Object/scope \u2013 Discussed."

Constitution of India \u2013 Article 243Y, 243X \u2013 Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 \u2013 Plea that any proposal for change or modification in the methodology adopted for levy of property tax ought to have been initiated through the Finance Commission alone \u2013 Held: It is the Legislature of the State which will ultimately take an appropriate action with respect to the recommendations made by the Finance Commission and the papers placed before it \u2013 If the Legislature itself has taken into account certain prevailing situation, which according to the Legislature is causing some prejudice to the financial health and condition of the municipalities and, therefore, the method of imposition of property tax ought to be changed, then it cannot be said that the matter must necessarily and ought to have emanated from the Finance Commission or that in the absence of such recommendations by the Finance Commission, no steps could have been taken by the Legislature \u2013 In the instant case, the exercise undertaken by the Legislature is completely consistent with the empowerment relatable to Article 243X and does not in any way go counter to said empowerment."

Extra Judicial Confession \u2013 s.30 \u2013 Evidentiary value of \u2013 Extra judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence and the court must ensure that the same inspires confidence and is corroborated by other prosecution evidence \u2013 After subjecting the evidence of the witness to a rigorous test on the touchstone of credibility, the extra judicial confession can be accepted and can be the basis of a conviction if it passes the test of credibility \u2013 Where an extra judicial confession is surrounded by suspicious circumstances, its credibility becomes doubtful and it loses its importance like in the present case. Discovery Statement \u2013 s.27 \u2013 Mere discovery cannot be interpreted as sufficient to infer authorship of concealment by the person who discovered the weapon \u2013 He could have derived knowledge of the existence of that weapon at the place through some other source also \u2013 Therefore, it cannot be presumed or inferred that because a person discovered the weapon, he was the person who had concealed it, least it can be presumed that he used it. Motive \u2013 s.8 \u2013 Evidentiary value \u2013 The presence of motive in the facts and circumstances of the case creates a strong suspicion against the accused appellant but suspicion, howsoever strong, cannot be a substitute for proof of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. Circumstantial Evidence \u2013 The Court has to draw an inference with respect to whether the chain of circumstances is complete, and when the circumstances therein are collectively considered, the same must lead only to the irresistible conclusion that the accused alone is perpetrator of crime."

Act to the respondent no. 1 \u2013 Respondent no.1 then filed suit for declaration against the appellant and the respondent no. 2 that the cheque which was dishonoured was handed over by him to respondent no.2 as a security and that appellant had not acquired any right over the said cheque as the respondent no.1 had no liability to discharge in favour of appellant \u2013 Appellant then filed an application u/Or. VII Rule 11seeking rejection of the plaint \u2013 Dismissed by trial court, however, the revisional court set aside the order of the trial court and rejected the plaint \u2013 In writ petition, the High Court set aside the order of the revisional court and remanded the matter holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction in rejecting the plaint \u2013 On appeal, held : High Court was not right in holding that the revisional court had exceeded its jurisdiction and it could not have allowed the application filed under Order VII Rule 11 and thereby reversed the order of the trial court and finally disposed of the suit - High Court failed to appreciate the second proviso to s. 115 of CPC (Orissa amendment) in its true perspective - Revisional court, being the High Court or the District Court, as the case may be, can reverse an order which would finally dispose of the suit or other proceeding - Revisional court being the District Court, did the same. s.115 and Order VII Rule 11 - Specific Relief Act,1963 - ss.34,41 - Negotiable Instruments Act - ss. 118, 138 - Revisional court-District Court allowing the application filed u/ord. VII r 11 by the appellant and thereby rejecting the plaint filed by the respondent no.1 \u2013 Justification of \u2013 Appellant\u2019s case that respondent no.2 has sought only declaratory that the cheque issued in the name of the appellant was a security and the appellant had no right to encash it and has not sought further or consequential reliefs, thus, suit is barred under Specific Relief Act; and that the suit filed by the respondent no.1 is an attempt to frustrate the possibility of the appellant initiating action under the provisions of the N.I. Act for the dishonour of cheque - Held : Omission on the part of the respondent no. 1 in praying for further consequential relief, would become relevant only at the time of final adjudication of the suit - Right of appellant to prosecute the respondent no. 1 owing to the dishonour of the cheque issued by the respondent no. 1 cannot be frustrated by seeking a declaration that the said cheque was handed over as a security \u2013 Such a declaration cannot be ex facie granted as it would be contrary to the provisions of the N.I. Act and particularly s.118(a) thereof \u2013 In these circumstances, while the respondent no. 1 has certain grievances arising from the MoU, against the appellants which may give rise to seek appropriate remedies in law, the declaratory reliefs sought in the plaint are barred by law - Hence, the plaint is liable to be rejected in exercise of jurisdiction u/Or.

        "HeadNote": "Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 \u2013 ss. 16 and 20 \u2013 Central Goods and Services Act, 2017 \u2013 ss. 54 and 56 \u2013 Interest on delayed refunds \u2013 Writ petitioners claimed that inaction on part of appellant leading to inordinate delay in granting refunds under IGST Act, was per se arbitrary and impacted the working capacity of the writ petitioners thereby reducing their ability to conduct business \u2013 There was delay ranging from 94 to 290 days in making refunds \u2013 Petitioners before the High Court claimed that appropriate compensation ought to be awarded to them along with the interest for delayed refunds \u2013 High Court granted simple interest at the rate of 9 % per annum on the delayed payments \u2013 Appeal before the Supreme Court \u2013 Whether in terms of relevant statutory provisions, the petitioners are entitled to interest on delayed refunds at rate of 6 % and not at the rate of 9 % per annum \u2013 Held : Wherever a statute specifies or regulates the interest, the interest will be payable in terms of the provisions of the Statute \u2013 Wherever a statute, is silent about the rate of interest and there is no express bar of payment of interest, any delay in paying the compensation or the amounts due, would attract award of interest at a reasonable rate on equitable grounds \u2013 In the present case, the relevant provision has prescribed rate of interest at 6 % where the case for refund is governed by the principle provision of s. 56 of the CGST Act \u2013 Since the delay in the instant case was in the range of 94 to 290 days, the matter has to be seen purely in the light of the concerned statutory provision \u2013 Present cases have not arisen from any order passed by an Adjudicating Authority or Appellate Authority or Appellate Tribunal or Court and the cases are strictly within the scope of the principal provision of Section 56 and not under the proviso thereof \u2013 Therefore, in terms of the principle part of s. 56 of the CGST Act, the interest would be awarded at the rate of 6 % \u2013 The award of interest at 9 % would be granted only if the matter was covered by the proviso to s. 56 \u2013 High Court was in error in awarding interest at the rate exceeding 6 % in the present matters."
