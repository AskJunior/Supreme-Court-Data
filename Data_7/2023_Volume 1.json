of \u2013 Dispute regarding self-acquired property of \u2018S\u2019 \u2013 \u2018S\u2019 had married twice \u2013 From the firstmarriage, a son \u2018C\u2019 was born, whose two children were the appellants\u2013 When one child of \u2018C\u2019 was minor and other was not born, heexecuted a release deed for relinquishing his share in the propertyfor valuable consideration in the year 1975 \u2013 It was also specifiedin the release deed that \u2018C\u2019 will not have any relation apart fromblood relation with \u2018S\u2019 \u2013 \u2018C\u2019 predeceased his father in the year 1978\u2013 Two children from the second marriage of \u2018S\u2019 filed suit for partitionfor self-acquired property of \u2018S\u2019 and contended to exclude thechildren from the first marriage of \u2018S\u2019 on the basis of the releasedeed \u2013 Trial court found the release deed to be null and void sinceit was executed by \u2018C\u2019, when his father was alive \u2013 Thus, the propertywas divided between the children from both the marriages equally\u2013 On appeal, the High Court found the release deed to be a validdocument and excluded the appellants \u2013 High Court held that therelease deed coupled with the consideration received by \u2018C\u2019 actedas an estoppel against the appellants \u2013 Appellants assailed the HighCourt judgment on two grounds \u2013 Firstly, \u2018C\u2019, the father ofappellants, at the time of the execution of release deed merely had aright as spes successionis, and, thus, the release deed had no effect\u2013 Secondly, the father being a natural guardian did not have thepower to bind the minor by a personal covenant \u2013 Held: On facts,the property in dispute was the self-acquired property of \u2018S\u2019 \u2013 Thus, at the time of execution of the release deed, \u2018C\u2019, the father of theappellants, did not possess any right in the property apart frombeing a spes successionis \u2013 Further, \u2018S\u2019, the father of \u2018C\u2019, paidvaluable consideration in order to secure the interest of the sonfrom the second marriage, who used to be ill \u2013 Release deed by aspes successionis would be incapable to convey or relinquish anyinterest in the property \u2013 However, on facts, execution of the releasedeed relinquished every other right apart from being a blood relative\u2013 Additionally, the conduct accompanied by receipt of valuableconsideration estopped \u2018C\u2019, the father of appellants, from claimingany right in the property \u2013 On the personal covenant, the limitationin s.8 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act,1956 can onlybe applicable when the minor possessed any independent right inthe property \u2013 On facts, it was not even the case of the appellantsthat they had any such independent right \u2013 Thus, the release deedcannot be interdicted as being a personal covenant by the naturalguardian which cannot bind a minor \u2013 Further contention that whenthe succession opened in 1988 on the death of their grandfather\u2018S\u2019, appellants being sons of \u2018C\u2019, the predeceased son of \u2018S\u2019, formedpart of class-I heir category under the Hindu Succession Act, notacceptable \u2013 Appellants were claiming through their father \u2018C\u2019 andcannot ward off the estoppel created by the conduct of \u2018C\u2019 underwhom they were claiming right in the property \u2013 Judgment of HighCourt accordingly affirmed \u2013Hindu Succession Act, 1956 \u2013 HinduMinority and Guardianship Act, 1956 \u2013 s.8 \u2013 Transfer of PropertyAct, 1882 \u2013 s.6(a) \u2013 s.8.Transfer of Property Act, 1882 \u2013 s.6(a) \u2013 Spes successonis \u2013Chance of an heir apparent succeeding to an estate, the chance ofa relation obtaining a legacy on the death of a kinsman or othermere possibility of a like nature \u2013 Held: Cannot be transferred \u2013 Aliving man has no heir \u2013 Equally, a person who may become theheir and entitled to succeed under the law upon the death of hisrelative would not have any right until succession to the estate isopened up \u2013 Unlike a co-parcener who acquires right to joint family property by his mere birth, in regard to the separate property of theHindu, no such right exists \u2013 Transfer by an heir apparent beingmere spes successonis is ineffective to convey any right.Estoppel \u2013 Effect of \u2013 Held: The effect of estoppel cannot bewarded off by persons claiming through the person whose conductgenerated the estoppel \u2013 The impact of estoppel applies irrespectiveof the personal law applicable to the party concerned \u2013 On facts,\u2018C\u2019, having received valuable consideration and allowed his father\u2018S\u2019 to proceed on the basis that the latter was free to deal with hisself-acquired property without the prospect of being haunted byany claim whatsoever as regards the property by \u2018C\u2019, a clear estoppelsprang into existence following the receipt of consideration by \u2018C\u2019\u2013 Estoppel would shut out in equity any claim otherwise either by\u2018C\u2019 or his children, viz., the appellants.Dismissing
