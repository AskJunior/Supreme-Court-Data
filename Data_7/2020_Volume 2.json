(iii) to (v) recalled \u2013 Held: Per Arun Mishra and Vineet Saran, JJ. \u2013 Provisions made in s.18A are rendered of academic use as they were enacted to take care of mandate issued in Dr. Subhash Kashinath case which no more prevails \u2013 A preliminary inquiry is permissible only in the circumstances as per law laid down by Constitution Bench in Lalita Kumari case \u2013 Further, concerning the applicability of provisions of s.438, CrPC, it shall not apply to the cases under 1989 Act \u2013 However, if the complaint does not make out a prima facie case under 1989 Act, the bar created by s.18 & 18A(i) shall not apply \u2013 In exceptional cases, power can be exercised u/s.482, CrPC for quashing cases to prevent misuse of provisions on settled parameters, as observed in the review petitions \u2013 Per S. Ravindra Bhat, J. (Supplementing) Any interference with the provisions of the Act, particularly with respect to the amendments precluding preliminary enquiry, or provisions which remove the bar against arrest of public servants accused of offences punishable under the Act, would not be a positive step \u2013 Various reports, official data including those released by the National Crime Records Bureau, paint a dismal picture \u2013 While considering any application seeking pre-arrest bail, the High Court has to balance the two interests: i.e. that the power is not so used as to convert the jurisdiction into that u/s.438, CrPC, but that it is used sparingly and such orders made in very exceptional cases where no prima facie offence is made out as shown in the FIR \u2013 Further also, if such orders are not made in those classes of cases, the result would inevitably be miscarriage of justice or abuse of process of law \u2013 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amednment Act, 2018 \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.14, 15, 17, 21, 23 & 24 \u2013 Code of Criminal Procdure, 1973 \u2013 ss.438 and 482 \u2013 Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 \u2013 Civil Rights Act, 1955.

Mysore Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1961 \u2013 s.20(1) \u2013 Validity of construction raised by the appellants under the 1961 Act \u2013 Held: The entire area comprising Virupapura Gaddi, where constructions were raised by the appellants, had been declared as protected area vide the 1988 notification, it follows that land owned by the Appellants could have only been used for the purpose of cultivation after issuance of such notification \u2013 However, the appellants had constructed huts and buildings on their lands for the commercial purpose of running hotels, restaurants and guest houses \u2013 From sub-section (1) of s.20, it is evident that owners/occupiers of protected areas cannot construct any building or utilize such areas in any manner other than cultivation, without the permission of the State Government \u2013 These constructions, in the instant case, were in violation of s. 20(1) of the 1961 Act.

        "HeadNote": "  Arbitration Act, 1940: Award by arbitrator \u2013 Claimant- contractor and opposite party entered into an agreement for construction of Sutlej Yamuna Link Canal and in that regard to carry out earth work, drainage behind lining and cement concrete lining \u2013 Estimated cost of project was Rs.31 lakhs and contract amount for the work was fixed at Rs.59.86 lakhs \u2013 Claimant raised demand for additional payment on the ground that during execution, the scope of work was considerably increased on account of various decisions by department regarding rebuilding of river banks and changes in the strata encountered during excavation due to incorrect geological data observations by department prior to inviting tender \u2013 Demand of additional payment led to arbitral dispute \u2013 Arbitrator accepted claim and passed award with 18% interest \u2013 Award presented before Sub-judge for making \u2018rule of court\u2019 \u2013 Opposite party filed objection that no reason was indicated for giving the award \u2013 Sub-judge accepted the objection to the extent of rejection of Claim no.1 and reduction of interest to 12% p.a. and in other respects the Award was made \u2018Rule of Court\u2019 \u2013 First appellate court rejected the claim in toto taking note of Clause 39 of the Contract Agreement which provided that the contractor was required to deliver in the office of the Executive Engineer every month during continuance of the work, the return showing details of extra work done with value of such work and if the details are not indicated, it shall be deemed that the contractor has waived all claims not included in such returns and will have no right to enforce any such claim not so included \u2013 In that light since the claim was ultimately found as not included in the monthly statement, the First Appellate Court held that the requirement of the conditions of the contract was not adhered to and set aside the Award of the Arbitrator \u2013 High Court also took note of Clause 39 of the contract and declined the claim except claim no.1 \u2013 In the instant appeal, it was contended by appellant-claimant that Note 6 to the schedule of work which formed a part of the contract provided that extra or other items of work shall be paid at the rate worked out on the basis of relevant Punjab Common Schedule of Rates Basis Plus Sanctioned Premium at the time of tendering \u2013 The difference between the estimated cost of Rs.31 lakhs and contract amount of Rs.59.86 lakhs was the sanctioned premium which corresponded to the overall premium of 93.12% on the work for computing the rates of extra items/quantity or work done \u2013 Insofar as the remaining claims, 93.12% would become applicable \u2013 It was contended that when the contract agreement is explicit insofar as the value and the difference being the sanctioned premium and the percentage being evident at 93.12%, the decision of the Arbitrator not indicating any further reasons in the Award would not be fatal \u2013 Opposite party (State of Punjab), referred to Clause 63 of the contract which provides for reference of the disputes to arbitration \u2013 The said clause specified the requirement that all Awards shall be in writing and in case of awards amounting to Rs.1 lakh and above, such Award shall state the reason for the amount awarded \u2013 Held: The quantum of the contract amount as against the estimated cost by itself could not have formed the basis to conclude the claim as made by the claimant towards sanctioned premium \u2013 Claim No.8 related to the work carried out on Daldal land wherein the soil was marshy and extra construction material was required to complete the work \u2013 Arbitrator awarded Rs.19.15 lakhs after indicating the amount for the said work on the same basis and deducting the agreed rate \u2013 Clause 39, no doubt, prescribes a method by which the claim is to be put forth in the statement every month \u2013 The said requirement will have to be construed as being put in the agreement so as to ensure that the additional work has actually been done, the claim is put forth along with details so that baseless claim is not made at a distant point in time when it will not be possible to determine \u2013 Though the Clause also indicates that if such claim is not made, it would amount to waiver, in a circumstance where the claim is ultimately put forth in the forum where an adjudication is made and based on the material if the adjudicating authority is satisfied that the actual work had been done and the contractor being entitled to the extra amount spent by him to carry out the work in an appropriate manner, it would not be just and proper to deny such claim only on the ground that it had not been indicated strictly in the manner as provided in the contract specially keeping in view the nature of work undertaken \u2013 When the fact remains that the Daldal land was situated in the area, work was carried out and extra material was used, the claim cannot be rejected outright adopting a technical view of the matter \u2013 However, the claim for the extra item will have to be calculated with premium at the same rate of 35.02% over and above the agreed rate and not at 93.12% \u2013 Regarding Claim No.16, no reason to interfere with the impugned orders \u2013 Further with regard to the interest sought under Claim No.18 in the absence of agreement with regard to the rate of interest, the interest as awarded by the Arbitrator was on the higher side and the First Appellate Court was justified in reducing the same to 12% p.a. \u2013 Claimant is entitled to the claim for extra items as put forth under Claim Nos. 2, 3, 8 and 12 by working out the difference of cost on the tender premium at 35.02% \u2013 On arriving at the quantum of the amount, the same shall be payable with interest at 12% p.a. in the manner as ordered by the First Appellate Court \u2013 Claim No.1 ordered by the High Court is sustained.

        "HeadNote": "  Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959: s.14B \u2013 Election of Gram Panchayat \u2013 Appellant elected as member of village Panchayat \u2013 Disqualification of appellant on account of non- submission of election expenses within the period prescribed \u2013 Held: A perusal of s.14B shows that the State Election Commission is to be satisfied as to whether a person has no good reason or justification for the failure to furnish account of election expenses \u2013 Secondly in terms of sub-section (2) for the reasons to be recorded, the disqualification under sub-section (1) can be removed or the period of disqualification can be reduced \u2013 In the instant case, explanation of appellant that he was advised bed rest on account of hypertension and diabetes which caused unintended delay in furnishing election expenses was not accepted \u2013 Collector passed order disqualifying the appellant for a period of five years to be member of Gram Panchayat \u2013 Appeal dismissed for the reason that the medical certificate was not issued by the Competent Authority \u2013 High Court while disposing of writ petition held that copy of medical certificate tendered by the appellant had no particulars such as name, diagnosis, date and reference number and the said certificate was issued by the private hospital bearing only a stamp of doctor and the said document cannot be relied upon and if the authorities did not accept it, there was no error in the said view \u2013 There is no reason to take a different view than the view affirmed by the High Court. Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959: s.14B \u2013 Plea of appellant was that there was delay of 15 days in submitting the election expenses and, therefore, disqualification for a period of five years was disproportionate to the default committed by her \u2013 Held: s.14B empowers the Election Commission to pass a just order of disqualification \u2013 The extent of period of disqualification has to be in proportion to the default \u2013 In the instant case, the order of disqualification for a period of five years was without taking into consideration the extent of default committed by the appellant \u2013 Such mechanical exercise of power without any adequate reasons, rendered the order of disqualification for a period of five years as illegal and untenable \u2013 Consequently, the order passed by the Collector and subsequent orders in appeal and in the writ petition are set aside in part to the extent of prescribing disqualification for a period of five years \u2013 Matter remitted to the Collector to take into consideration the period of delay/default, the purport for which the election expenses are sought to be furnished and that the order of disqualification operates from the date of the order including delay in passing the order of disqualification \u2013 Election laws. Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959: s.14B \u2013 Whether provision of s.14B, mandatory or directory \u2013 Held: In s.14B, there is no prohibitive or negative expressions used as it empowers the Election Commission to pass a just order of disqualification \u2013 Sub- section (1) of s.14B empowers the State Election Commission to pass an order of disqualification of a candidate, if the candidate fails to lodge account of election expenses for lack of good reason or without any justification \u2013 Such satisfaction is required to be recorded by the Election Commission \u2013 Since authority is vested with power to reduce the period of disqualification, therefore, makes the provision directory. Maharashatra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961: s.15B \u2013 Elections of Panchayat Samiti \u2013 Disqualification of appellant for contesting elections for the period of five years on account of non-submission of election expenses within period prescribed \u2013 Meanwhile, elections of Gram Panchayat were notified and appellant submitted his nomination for the post of Sarpanch \u2013 Objection against it was rejected by the Returning Officer and appellant was duly elected to the post of Sarpanch \u2013 Returning Officer held that disqualification was applicable only for the elections of Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis and not for elections of Gram Panchayat \u2013 Order of Returning Officer rejecting objection challenged before High Court \u2013 Writ petition also filed by appellant challenging disqualification order passed by Collector \u2013 High Court dismissed writ petition of the appellant while writ petition filed by objector was partly allowed by setting aside the order passed by Returning officer rejecting the objections raised by him \u2013 On appeal, held: Art.243-O of the Constitution of India provides that no election to any panchayats shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as provided for by or under any law made under the legislature of the State \u2013 The dispute in these appeals did not pertain to election to either House of the Parliament but to a local body \u2013 The constitutional bar is contained in Art.243-O of the Constitution of India in furtherance of which s.15A was inserted in the year 1994 \u2013 s.10A of the 1959 Act and s.9A of the 1961 Act read with Arts.243-K and 243-O, are pari materia with Art.324 of the Constitution of India \u2013 The remedy of an aggrieved person accepting or rejecting nomination of a candidate is by way of an election petition in view of the bar created under s.15A of the 1959 Act \u2013 The said Act is a complete Code providing machinery for redressal to the grievances pertaining to election as contained in s.15 of the 1959 Act \u2013 High Court though exercises extraordinary jurisdiction under Art.226 of the Constitution of India but such jurisdiction is discretionary in nature and may not be exercised in view of the fact that an efficacious alternative remedy is available and more so exercise restraint in terms of Art.243-O of the Constitution of India \u2013 Once alternate machinery is provided by the statute, the recourse to writ jurisdiction is not an appropriate remedy \u2013 It is a prudent discretion to be exercised by the High Court not to interfere in the election matters, especially after declaration of the results of the elections but relegate the parties to the remedy contemplated by the statute \u2013 In view of this, writ petition should not have been entertained by the High Court \u2013 However, the order of the High Court that the appellant has not furnished the election expenses incurred on the date of election did not warrant any interference \u2013 Constitution of India \u2013 Arts.243K, 243O and 324 \u2013 Election-Laws.  Interpretation of Statutes: Whether a provision is mandatory or directory \u2013 Prohibitive or negative words are ordinarily indicative of mandatory nature of the provision \u2013 Maharashtra Village Panchayats Act, 1959 \u2013 s.14B     "
