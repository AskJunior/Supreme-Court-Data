Bombay City Civil Court, and that this court shall, notwith- standing anything contained in any law, have jurisdiction to re- ceive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding Rs. 10,000 in value arising within Greater Bombay except certain kinds of suits which were specified in the Section, Section 4 of the Act provided that subject to the excep- tions \u2018specified in s, 3 the Provincial Government may, by notifica-. tion in the official Gazette, invest the City Civil Court with juris- diction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceed- ings of a civil nature arising within the Greater Bombay and of such value not exceeding Rs. 25,000 as may be specified in the notification. Section 12 barred the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court to try suits and proceedings cognizable by the City Civil Court. In exercise of the powers conferred by s. 4 the Pro- vincial Government invested the City Civil Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding Rs. 25,000 in value. The first respondent instituted a suit in the High Court of Bombay for recovery of Rs. 11,704 on the basis of a promissory note, contending that the Provincial Legislature had no power to make laws with respect to jurisdiction of courts in regard to suits on promissory notes which was>.a matter covered by item 53 of List I, and the Bombay City Civil Court Act of 1948 was therefore ultra vires. Tt was turther contended on his behalf that in any event s. 4 of the Act was in- valid as it involved a delegation of legislative powers to the Pro- vincial Government and that the suit was therefore cognisable by the High Court. Held by the Full Court\u2014{i) that the impunged Act was a law with respect to a matter enumerated in List II and was not ultra vires; (ii) that as the legislature had exercised its judgment and determined that the City Civil Courts should be invested with pecuniary jurisdiction up to Rs. 25,000 and all that was left to the discretion of the Provincial Government was the determination of the conditions under which the court should be invested with the enhanced jurisdiction, s. 4 did not involve any delegation of legislative -powers but was only an instance of conditional legis- lation and was not witra vires or invalid on this ground; (iii) inas- much as the impunged Act was in pith and substance a law with respect to a matter covered by List II, the fact that it incidental- ly affected suits relating to promissory notes (a subject falling within items 28 and 53 of List I) would not affect its validity and the suit was accordingly not cognisable by the High Court. Per Faz Aut, Menr Cuanp Manayan AND Muxueryea JJ.\u2014 The power of the Provincial Legislature to make laws with respect to \u201cadministration of justice\u201d and \u201cconstitution and organisation of all courts\u201d under item 1 of List I is wide enough to include the power to make laws with regard to the jurisdiction of courts established by the Provincial Legislature; the object of item 53 of List I, item 2 of List II and, item 15 of List III is to confer special powers on the Central and the Provincial Legisla- tures to make laws relating to the jurisdiction of courts with rest pect to the particular matters that are referred to in Lists 1 and II respectively and the Concurrent List, and these provisions do not in any way curtail the power of Provincial Legislature under Item 1 of List Hl to make laws with regard to jurisdiction of courts and to confer jurisdiction on courts established by it to try all causes of a civil nature subject to the power of the Central and Provincial Legislatures to make special provisions relating to particular subjects referred to in the Lists. Per Patangatt Sastat and Das JJ.\u2014The words \u201cadminis- tration of justice\u201d and \u201cconstitution and organisation of all courts\u201d in item 1 of List If must be understood in a restricted sense excluding from their scope \u201cjurisdiction and powers of courts\u201d as the latter subject is specially dealt with in item 2 of List HH. It\u00e9m 1 of List If does not therefore by itself authorise legislation with respect to jurisdiction and powers of courts, but the legislative power under item 2 in regard to \u2018jurisdiction and powers of courts\u201d,, which can legitimately be exercised with res- pect to any of the matters in List II, can be exercised with res- pect to administration of justice as this is one of the matters enumerated in that List, with the result that the subject of general jurisdiction of courts is brought within the authorised arca of provincial legislation; and as the Provincial Legislature is thus competent to make a law with respect to the general jurisdiction of the court, the apparent conflict with the central legislative power under item 53 of List I can be resolved by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance and incidental encroachment. (The legislative practice which prevailed in India before 1935 was relied on in this case in support of the view that the Pro- vincial Legislatures had power under the constitution of 1935 to invest courts constituted by them with general pecuniary juris- diction.] \u2018 Quaere: Whether it was not open to the Legislatures of India under the Government of India Act of 1935 to delegate their legislative powers to other agencies. .

The Income-tax Officer, Dacca, acting under the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1944, sent by registered post a notice to the Manager of an Estate belonging to the Tripura State but situated in Bengal, calling upon the latter to furnish a return of the agricultural income derived from the Estate during the previous year. The notice was received by the Manager in the Tripura State. The State, by its then Ruler, instituted a suit in June, 1946, against the Province of Bengal and the Income-tax Officer, in the court of the Subordinate Judge of Dacca for 9 declaration that the said Act in so far it purporated to impose a liability to pay agricultural income-tax on the plaintiff was ultra vires and void, and for a perpetual injunction to restrain the defendants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff. The suit was subsequently transferred ta the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore. The partion of India under the Indian Independence Act took place on the 15th August 1947, and the   Province of East Bengal in which the Estate was situated, was substituted as a defendant in the place of the Province of Bengal | on an application made it, and in its written statement it contended that the court of Alipore which was situated in West Bengal had no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit. The High Court of Calcutta, reversing the order of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore held that the provisions of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, did not apply to the case and, as the matter was accordingly governed by the rules of international law, the court of Alipore had no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit: Held per Kanu C.J., Paranyart Sasrri, Muxneryza and CuanprasEKHaRA Aryan JJ. (Fazn Aut J. concurring)\u2014The suit was not one with respect to any property transferred to East Bengal by the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabi- lities) Order, 1947, nor was it a suit im respect of any \u201crights\u201d transferred by the said Order, inasmuch as the Province of East Bengal obtained the right to levy income-tax not by means of any transfer under the said Order, but by virtue of sovereign rights which ' were preserved by s. 18 (3) of the Indian Independence Act, \u201d 1947, and Art. 12 (2) of the said Order had no application to the case. Held per Kanta C.J., Paranyarr Sastrr, MuKHerye4 AND CuanprasEKHarA Arar JJ. (Fazu Aut J. dissenting\u2014(i) Since the object of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, was to provide for the initial distribution of rights, properties and liabilities as between the two Dominions and their Provinces, a wide and liberal construction, as far as the Janguage used would admit, should be placed upon the Order, so as to leave no gap or lacuna in relation to the matters sought to be provided for. The words \u201cliability in respect of an actionable wrong\u201d should not therefore be understood in the restricted sense of liability for damages for completed acts, but so as to cover the liability to be restrained by injunction from completing what on the allegations in the plaint are illegal or unauthorised acts which have been commenced. As the Province of Bengal was, on the allegations in the plaint, liable to be restrained from proceeding with an illegal assessment, that liability was, accordingly, a liabi- lity in respect of \u201can actionable wrong other than breach of contract\u201d within the meaning of Art. 10 (2) (a) of the abovesaid Order; and, as the cause of action arose wholly in Dacca within the Province of East Bengal, that liability passed to the Province of East Bengal under Art. 10 (2) (a), the latter must be deemed to be substituted as a party to the suit and the suit must continue in\u2019 the court of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore, under Art. 4 of the Indian- Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947. (ii) Assuming that the cause of action did not wholly arise   in Dacca, Art. 10 (2) (c) would apply and the Province of East X Bengal would still be fiable, though jointly with the Province of West Bengal. (iii) As the suit was not one \u201cto set aside or modify any assessment made under the Act\u201d, s. 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1944, had no application and the suit was there- fore one in respect of an \u201cactionable\u201d wrong within the meaning of Art. 10 (2) (a). \u00a9 Per Fazu Aur J.\u2014The words \u201cliability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract\u201d in Art. 10 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order 1947, refer to liability capable of being ascertained in terms of money such as liability for damages for tort and not liability in any abstract or academic sense. Even if a meaning, as wide as they can bear in a legal context, is given to the words \u201cactionable wrong\u201d and \u201cliability\u201d two elements are necessary to constitute an actionable wrong, namely, (i) an act or omission amounting to an infringement of a legal right of a person or breach of duty x towards him, and (ii) damage or harm resulting therefrom. The mere issuing of a notice under s. 4 of the Bengal Agri- cultural Income-tax Act, 1944, by the Income-tax Officer is not an actionable wrong because no right known to law is infringed thereby and no action for damages can be maintained in respect of such an act, even assuming that the Income-tax Officer had ex- ceeded his powers or acted under an invalid provision of law. No \u201cliability for an actionable wrong\u201d was thus involyed in the suit and no liability ia respect of such a wrong could therefore be said to have been transferred to the Province of East Bengal within the meaning of Art. 10 (2) of the said Order so as to entitle the plaintiff to continue the suit against the Province of East Bengal under Art. 10 (2). For the purpose of understanding the full scope of s. 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1944, it is necessary , also to read the latter part which provides that no suit or other - proceeding shall lie against any officer of the Crown for anything in good faith done or intended to be done under the Act.\u201d The fatter part of the section clearly excludes the jurisdiction of the courts to prevent the Income-tax Officer from proceeding with an assessment which has been started and the section must on a fair construction be held to bar all suits in connection with such assessment whether against the State or an Income-tax Officer of the State. If, therefore, no suit or action lies, there can be no liability for an actionable wrong. [The nature actionable wrongs and torts discussed.] Judgment of the\u2019 Calcutta High Court reversed.        "

Section 3 (1) of the Patiala-and East Punjab States Union General Provsions (Administration) Ordinance (No. XVI of 2005) which came into force on February 2, 1949, and re-enacted s, 3 of an earlier Ordinance which was in force from August 20, 1948, provided that as from the appointed day (i.\u00a2., August 20, 1948) all\u2019 laws in force in the Patiala State shall apply mutatis mutandis to the territories of the said Union, provided that all proceedings pending before courts and other authorities of any of the Coven- anting States shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proceedings in force in such Covenanting State immediately before August 20, 1948. In one of the Covenanting States, viz., Kapurthala, there was a law of income-tax in force on the said date, the rate of tax payable under which was lower than that payable under the Patiala Income-tax Act, and in an- other Covenanting State, Nabha, there was no law of income-tax at all. For the accounting year ending April 12, 1948, assessees of Kapurthala State were assessed at the lower rates fixed by the Kapurthala Income-tax Act, in accordance with the proviso in s. 3 of the Ordinance relating to pending proceedings, and the asses- sees of Nabha were assessed at the higher rates fixed by the Patiala Act as there was fo income-tax law in Nabha on Augus' 20, 1948, and no income-tax proceedings were therefore pending in Nabha. The petitioner who was an assessee residing in Nabha and who was assessed under the Patiala Act applied under Art. 32 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the assessment on the ground (i) that he had been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and equal protec- tion of the laws guaranteed by Art. 14 of the Constitution inas- much as he was assessed at a higher rate than that at which assessees of Kapurthala were assessed, (ii) that, as the Ordinance bringing the Patiala Income-tax Act into force in Nabha was en- acted only on August 20, 1948, it cannot operate retrospectively and authorise the levy of tax on income which had accrued in the year ending April 12, 1948, and therefore he was threatened with infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by Art. 31 (1) of the Constitution that no one shall be deprived of his property save under authority of law : Held, (i) that the discrimination, if any, between the assessees of Kapurthala and Nabha was not brought about by the Ordinance but by the circumstance that there was no income-tax law in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees; and in any case the provision that pending proceedings should be concluded according to the law applicable at the time when the rights or liabilities accrued and the proceedings commenced, was a reasonable law founded upon a reasonable classification of the assessees which is permissible under the equal protection clause; (ii) that, as there is a special provision in Art. 265 of the Constitution that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law, cl. (1) of Art. 31 must, be regarded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition or collection of tax, and inasmuch as the right conferred by Art. 265 is not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution, it could not be enforced under Art. 32.Onrrcinat Jurrspiction \u00a2 Petition No. 135 of 1950. Application under Ast. 32 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari and prohibi- tion. Dr. Tek Chand (Hardayal Hardy and Jindra Lal, with him) for the petitioner. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (S. M. Sikri, with him) for the respondent. . "
