The respondents agree to deliver 61 bales of cloth to the appellant by the 17th November, 1941. The agreement provided \"we shall continue sending the goods as soori as they are prepared to you up to Magsar Badi 15, Sambat 1998...... We shall go on supplying goods to y_ou of the Victoria Mills as soon as they are supplied to us by the said Mills. . . . . . We shall go on delivering the goods to you ...... out \u00b7of the goods noted above which will be prepared by the Mill.\" In a suit for damages for non-delivery of the goods the respondents pleaded that as they had not received the goods from the Victoria Mill~ before the 17th of November, 1941, performance of the contract had become impossible by reason of an event which they could not prevent and the contract had therefore become void under Sec. 56, Indian Contract Act : Held, (i) that, on a proper construction of the contract, delivery of the goods was not made contingent on their being supplied to the respondents by the Victoria Mills. The words \"prepared by the Mills\" were only a description of the goods to be supplied, and the expressions \"as soon as they are prepared\" and \"as soon as they are supplied to us by the said Mill\" simply indicated the 'process of delivery. This was not therefore a case in which the doctrine of frustration of contract could be invoked. (ii) Even apart from the construction of the agreement, as the respondents had not shown that they had placed an order for the goods with the Victoria Mills and yet the Mills had failed to supply, there was a clear breach of contract to deliver and the appellant was entitled to recover damages.

It does not alter the law as regards the devolution of any kind of property owned by a Hindu male and does not purport to regulate succession to the property of a Hindu female at all. The Act cannot therefore be invoked to determine the heirs of a Hindu female in respect of her stridhan property. The property of a Hindu female who dies as a maiden goes in the first place to her uterine brothers, then to the mother and then to the father, and on failure of the mother and father, it goes to the nearest relations, that is to say, to the sapindas of the father and in their default the sapindas of the mother, both in the order of propinquity.  Under the Mitakshara law of succession as well as the Mayukha law the paternal uncle\u2019s son is entitled to succeed to the pro- perty of a Hindu in preference to sister\u2019s sons. "

Article 329 (b) of the Constitution of India provides that \u201cno election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for, by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature.\u201d The Representation of the People Act, 1951, which made detailed provisions for election to the various Legislatures of the country also contains a provision (sec. 80) that no election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The appellant, who was a candidate for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Madras and whose nomination paper was rejected by the Returning Officer, applied to the High Court of Madras under article. 226 of the Constitution for a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Returning Officer rejecting his nomination paper and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published.  Held: by the Full Court (Patanjali Sastri, C. J., Fazl Ali, Mahajan, Mukherjea, Das and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ.) that in view of the provisions of articles 329 (b) of the Constitution and sec. 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the High Court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Returning Officer.  The word \u201celection\u201d has by long usage in connection with the process of selection of proper representatives in democratic institutions acquired both a wide and a narrow meaning.  In the narrow narrow sense it is used to mean the final selection of a candidate which may embrace the result of the poll when there is polling or a particular candidate being returned unopposed when \u2018there is no poll. In the wide sense, the word is used to connote the entire process culminating in a candidate being declared elected and it is in this wide sense that the word is used in Part XV of the Constitution in which article 329 (b) occurs.  The scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, \u201dseems to be that any matter which has the effect of vitiating an election should be brought up\u2019 only at\u2019 the appropriate stage in an appropriate manner _be- fore a special tribunal and should not be brought up at an inter- mediate stage before any court. Under the election law, the only significance which the rejection of a nomination paper has, consists in the fact that it can be used as a ground to call the election in question. Article 329 (b) was apparently enacted to prescribe the manner in which and the stage at which this ground, and other grounds which may be raised under, the law to call the election in question, could be urged. It follows by necessary implication from the language of this provision that those grounds cannot be urged in any other manner, at any other stage and before any other court. If the grounds on which-an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and errors, if any, are rectified, there will be no meaning in enacting a Provision like article 329(b) and in setting up a_ special tribunal. Any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies, which the Constitution \u2014 could not have contemplated, one of them being that conflicting views may be expressed by the High Court at the pre-polling stage and by the election tribunal which is to be an independent body, at the stage when the matter is brought up before it. Therefore, questioning the rejection of a nomination paper is \u201cquestioning - the election\u201d within the meaning of article 329 (b) of the Constitution and sec. 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.  Having regard to the important functions which the  legislatures have to perform in democratic countries, it has always been recognized to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elec- tions should be postponed till after the elections are over, so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted. In conformity with this Principle, the scheme of the election law in this country as well as in England is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the \u201celection\u201d; and if any irregularities are committed while, it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which, under the law by which elections are governed, would have the effect of vitiating the \u201celection\u201d and enable the persons affected\u2019 to call it in question, they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an clection petition and not be made the - subject of a dispute before any court while the election is in progress.  The right to vote or stand as a candidate for election is not a civil right but is a creature of statute or special law and must be subject to the limitations imposed by it. Strictly speaking, it is the sole right-of the Legislature to examine and determine all matters relating to the election of its own members, and if the legislature takes it out of its own hands and vests in a special tribunal an entirely new and unknown jurisdiction, that special jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance with the law which creates it. Where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of.     "

        "HeadNote": " Impartial estate\u2014Succession\u2014Extinction of branch\u2014-Disputes as to succession\u2014Compromise\u2014Construction of deed\u2014Disruption of family\u2014Renunciation of right to succession by junior members of other branches\u2014Sufficiency of evidence\u2014Right to effect partition\u2014 Effect of general words of release.  To establish that an impartial estate has ceased to be joint family property for purposes of succession it is necessary to prove an intention, express or implied, on the part of the junior members of the family to give up their chance of succeeding to the estate. In each case it is incumbent on the plaintiff to adduce satisfactory grounds for holding that the joint ownership of the defendant\u2019s branch in the estate was determined so that it became the separate property of the last holder\u2019s branch. The test to be applied is whether the facts show a clear intention to renounce or surrender any interest in the impartial estate or a_ relin- relinquishment of the right of succession and an intention to impress upon the zamindari the character of separate property. The right to bring about a partition of an impartial estate cannot be inferred from the power of alienation that the holder thereof may possess. In the case of an impartial estate the power to divide it amongst the members does not exist, though the power in the holder to alienate it is there, and from the existence of the one power the other cannot be deduced, as it is destructive of the very nature and character of the estate and makes it partible property. A member of a joint family owning an impartible estate can on behalf of himself and his heirs renounce his right of succession but any such relinquishment must operate for the benefit of all the members and the surrender must be in favour of all the branches of the family as representing all its members.  General words of release in a release deed do not mean release of rights other than those then put up, and have to be limited to the circumstances which were in the contemplation of the parties when it was executed.  On the death of the holder of an impartible estate who represented the first branch his widow K got into possession claiming that the estate was the separate property of her husband and also under a will. Disputes arose between her and the members of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th branches of the family and these were settled amicably. S who was the senior member of the 3rd branch obtained village D and one-fourth of certain pannai lands as absolute owner and executed a release deed on 6th May, 1890, in these terms: \u201cWhatever rights over the said zamin proper- ties and in all other above mentioned properties S might possess he gives up such rights absolutely in favour of the said K and her heirs enabling them to enjoy them with the power of aliena have no claim at all to the properties shown as belonging to K.\u201d KS who represented the 2nd branch and had instituted a suit tion thereof by gift, sale etc......... The said S and his heirs shall against. K compromised the suit on the 10th May, 1890, under a deed which provided inter alia: (i) that the zamindari shall be enjoyed by K till her lifetime and that KS and his heirs shall after the lifetime of K enjoy the zamindari except village D which was given to S; (ii) village B and one-fourth of certain pannai lands shail be given to KS absolutely ; (iii) all other pannai lands, build- ings and movables which belonged to K\u2019s husband shall be enjoyed by K and her heirs absolutely.\u201d On the death of K the estate became vested in Z, the son of KS. The death of Z without issue the second branch became extinct and disputes arose with regard to the ownership of the pannai lands and buildings, village B, and the zamindari between the widow of Z (who was the grand-daughter of K) and the senior members of the 3rd and 4th branches: Held: (i) that as KS was competent to alienate the pannai lands and buildings in favour of K and vest her with absolute title, and S had also agreed to give them to her absolutely, K became the absolute owner of these lands and buildings and these ceased to be part of the joint estate and devolved on the grand-daughters of K as her stridhana heirs. (ii) In view of the arrangement of 1890 it was not open to any of the parties to deny that the village B was separated from the zamindari and given to KS absolutely as his private property, The village consequently devolved on Z as separate property and on his death it devolved on his widow. (iii) The arrangement made in 1890 did not evidence a partition amongst the\u2019 members of the joint family or prove an intention on the part of the junior members of the family to renounce their expectancy of succession by survivor-ship on failure of the male lineal descendants in the branch of KS.  (iv) That the recitals in the release deed executed by S had to be read in the light of the compromise in the suit of KS. and the proper proper inference from both the documents read together was that S renounced only his right to succeed to the zamindari immediately as the senior most member of the family and that he. did not renounce his right or the right of his branch to succeed to the zamindari by survivor-ship if and when occasion arose ; the senior member of the 3rd branch was therefore entitled to succeed to the zamindari in preference to the senior member of the 4th branch and the widow of Z.

The fact that a trade mark after registration could be separately assigned and not as a part of the goodwill of the business only, does not take the expenditure for registration capital expenditure.

The respondent, a company formed for the purpose of manufacturing silk cloth, installed a plant for dyeing silk yarn as a part of its business. During the chargeable accounting period (1st January, 1943, to 31st December, 1943) owing to difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war, it could make no use of this plant and it remained idle for some time. In August, 1943, the pl_ant was let out to' another company on a monthly rent. The question being whether the income received by the respondent company in the year 1943 by way of rent of this plant was income from business and assessable to excess profits tax, the High Court of Bombay held that, as the assessee was not able to use the plant as a commercial asset, it had ceased to be a commercial asset. in the assessee's hands and the rent received was not income from business. On appeal: Held, that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business by a company formed for carrying on business and earning profits, does not cease to be . a commercial asset of that business as soon as it is temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade ; the income from the asset would be profit of the business irrespective of the manner in which that asset is exploited by the owner, and the rent in question was therefore income from business and assessable to excess profits tax. No general principle, however, can be laid down which is applicable to all cases. Each case has to be decided on its own circumstances.  "

An order of detention to prevent black-marketing cannot be held to be illegal merely because in the grounds for such detention the detaining authority has referred only to the past activities of the person detained, inasmuch as instances of past activities may give rise to a subjective mental conviction that it is necessary to detain such person to prevent him from indulging in black-marketing in the future. Under the . Preventive Detention Act, 1950, the test as to whether an order of detention should be made is the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority; the Court has no power to consider whether the grounds supplied by the authority are sufficient to give rise to such satisfaction. The establishment of the Advisory Board by the Amending Act of 1951 has not made the matter a justiciable one, and even after the Amending Act the Court has no power to consider whether the grounds supplied are sufficient for making an order of detention.

In 1865, the Government of Bombay called upon the predecessor in title of the Corporation of Bombay to remove some markets from a certain site and vacate it, and on the application of the then Municipal Commissioner the Government passed a resolution approving and authorising the grant of another site to the Municipality. The resolution stated further that \u201cthe Government do not consider that any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be, like other public buildings, for the benefit of the whole community.\u201d The Corporation gave up the sites on which the old markets were situated and spent a sum of over 17 lacs in erecting and maintaining markets on the new site. In 1940 the Collector of Bombay, overruling the objection of the Corporation, assessed the new site under s. 8 of the \u2018Bombay City Land Revenue Act to land revenue rising from Rs. 7,500 to Rs. 30,000 in 50 years. The Corporation sued for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and that it was entitled to hold the land for ever without payment of any assessment. The High Court of Bombay held applying the principle of Ramsden v. Dyson(+) that the Government had lost its tight to assess the land in question by reason of the \u00a2quity arising on the facts of the case in favour of the Corporation and there was thus a limitation on the right of the Government to assess under s. 8 of the said Act : Held:  per Kania C. J., Das, Chandrasekhar Aryan and Bose JJ. (Patanjali Sastri  JJ. dissenting)\u2014that the Government was, not under the circumstances of the case, entitled to assess land revenue on the land in question.  Per Kania C. J., Das and Bose JJ.\u2014Though there was no effectual grant by the Government passing title in the land to the Corporation by reason of non-compliance with the statutory formalities, yet, inasmuch as the Corporation had never-the-less taken possession of the land in terms of the Government resolu- tion and continued in such possession openly, uninterruptedly and as of right for over 70 years, the Corporation had acquired the limited title it had been prescribing for during the period, that is to say, the right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent, but only for the purposes of a market and for no other purposes. The right acquired included as part of it an immunity from payment of rent which constituted a right in limitation of the Government's right to assess in excess of the specific limit established and preserved by the Government Resolution within the meaning of s. 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act (II of 1876) there being for the purposes of \u00b7this case no distinction between rent and revenue. Per CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.-If the Resolution of 1865 can be read as meaning that the grant was of rent-free land the case would come strictly within the doctrine of estoppel enunciated in s. 115 of the Indian Evidence Act. Even otherwise, if there was merely the holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the future the Government must be deemed to have bound themselves to fulfil it. The right to levy assessment is a prerogative right of the Government and it is hard to conceive of a case where it could be said to be lost by adverse possession. A court of equity must prevent the per perpetration of a legal fraud. "

The rule of construction embodied in s. 106 of the Transfer f Property Act applies not only to express leases of uncertain duration but also to leases implied by law which may be inferred from possession and acceptance of rent and other circumstances.  When the rent reserved is an annual rent, a presumption would arise that the tenancy was an annual tenancy unless there  is something to rebut this presumption. But under s. 107 of the Transfer of Property Act a tenancy from year to year or reserving an yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument. The defendant executed a registered kabuliyat to the Receiver who was managing an estate pending a suit, purporting to take a plot of land on lease for a period of ten years at a rental of Rs. 46 per annum and paid the first year'.i rent of Rs. 46 on the 8th March, 1925, and the next year's rent on the 16th March, 1926. No further rent was paid by the defendant to the Receiver or to the proprietor after that date. The proprietor, treating the defendant as a monthly tenant it served notice to quit on him on the 18th July, 1942, asking the latter to vacate on the 7th August, 1942, and instituted a suit for ejectment in July, 1943. The kabuliyat was found to be inoperative in law and the  defendant contended that the payment and acceptance of annual rent in 1925 and 1926 did not create a monthly tenancy but two tenancies for one year each for two successive years, that the relation of landlord and tenant came to an end on the expiration of the second annual lease, and, as there was no holding over, the suit was time-barred: Held:  (i) that from the facts a tenancy could be presumed to have come into existence from 1924 ; (ii) as the purpose of the tenancy was for building structures on the land, under sec. 106 of the Transfer of Property Act the tenancy must be presumed to be one from month to month in the absence of a contract to the contrary ; (iii) a contract that the tenancy was for one year certain could not be inferred in the present case from the fact that an annual rent was paid in 1925 and 1926, inasmuch as the kabuliyat, though inoperative in law, showed that the parties never intended to create a lease for one year; (iv) on the facts of the case it was quite proper to hold that the tenancy was one from month to month since its inception in 1924 and the suit was not time barred.

The West Bengal Special Courts Act (X of 1950) was entitled \u201cAn Act to provide for the speedier trial of certain offences,\u201d and the object of the Act, as declared in the preamble, was \u201cto provide for the speedier trial of certain offences\u201d. Section 3 of the Act empowered the State Government by notification in the official gazette to constitute Special Courts, and sec. 5 provided that \u201cA Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases, as the State Government may by general or special order in writing, direct.\u201d The Act laid down a procedure for trial before Special Courts which was different in several respects from that laid down by the Criminal Procedure Code for trial of offences generally. \u2018The respondent, who was convicted by a Special Court which tried his case under a notification issued by the Government under sec, 5, contended \u2018that the said section was unconstitutional and void inasmuch as it contravened Art, 14 of the Constitution, which provides that \u201cthe State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India\u201d : Held: Per Fazal Ali, Mahajan, Mukherjea, Chandrasekhara Aiyar and Bose JJ. (Patanjali Shastri C. J., dissenting)\u2014Section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950, contravenes Art, 14 of the Constitution and is void inasmuch as (per Fazal Ali, Mahajan, Mukherjea, Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ.) the procedure laid down by the Act for the trial by the Special Courts varied substantially from that laid down for the trial of offences generally by the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Act did not classify, or lay down any basis for classification, of the cases which may be directed to be tried by the Special Court, but left it to the uncontrolled discretion of the State Government to direct any case which it liked to be tried by the Special Court. Das J.\u2014Section 5 (1)of the Act, in so far as it empowered the State Government to direct \u201coffences\u201d or \u201cclasses of offences\u201d or \u201cclasses of cases\u201d to be tried by a Special Court, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government but by necessary implication contemplates a proper classification and is not void. That part of the section which empowered the Government to direct \u201ccases\u201d as distinct from \u201cclasses of cases\u201d to be tried by a Special Court is void. Patanjali Shastri  C, J.\u2014Section 5 (1) of the Act is not void or unconstitutional wholly or even in part. Per Fazal Ali, Mahajan, Mukherjea, Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ. \u2014 A rule of procedure laid down by law comes as much within the purview of Art. 14 of the Constitution as any rule of substantive law and it is necessary that all litigants, who are similarly situated, are able to avail themselves of the same procedural rights for relief and for defence with like protection and without discrimination. (ii) If it is established that the person complaining has been discriminated against as a result of legislation and denied equal privileges with others occupying the same position, it is not incumbent upon him before he can claim relief on the basis of fundamental rights to assert and prove that, in making the law, the legislature was actuated by a hostile or inimical intention against a particular person or class; nor would the operation of Art. 14 be excluded merely because it is proved that the legislature had no intention to discriminate, though discrimination was the necessary consequence of the Act. The question of intention may arise in ascertaining whether an officer acted mala-fide \u2018or not; but it cannot arise when discrimination follows or arises on the express terms of the law itself,  (iii) The language of sec. 5 (1) clearly and unambiguously vests the State Government with unrestricted discretion to direct any cases or class of cases to be tried by the Special Court, not a discretion to refer cases only when it is of opinion that a speedier trial is necessary. (iv) Assuming that the preamble throws any light on the section, the necessity of speedier trial is too vague, uncertain and elusive a criterion to form a rational basis for discrimination. (v) It cannot be said that an Act does not contravene the equality rule laid down by Art. 14 simply because it confers unregulated discretion on officers or administrative bodies. The true position is that if the statute itself is not discriminatory the charge of violation of the article may be only against the official who administers it, but if the statute itself makes a discrimination without any proper or reasonable basis, it would be void for being in conflict with Art. 14. , (vi) The notification issued under the Act in the present case would also come within the definition of law and could be impeached apart from the Act if it violates Art. 14, Das J.-\u2014(1) Article 14 does not insist that every piece of legislation must have universal application and it does not take away from the State the power to classify persons for the purposes of legislation, but the classification must be rational, and in order to satisfy this test (i) the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguished those that are grouped together from others, and (ii) that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act. The differentia which is the basis of the classification and the object of the Act are distinct things and what is necessary is that there must be a nexus between them. But the- mere fact that the inequality has not been made with the special intention of prejudicing a particular person or persons but in the general interest of administration will not validate a law if in fact it results in inequality of treatment. Nor can the constitutionality of a statute depend on the degree of the inequality brought about by the law. . . (2) Although the preamble to an Act cannot override the plain meaning of its operative parts, it may nevertheless assist in ascertaining what the true meaning or implication of a particular section\u2019 is; and the part of sec.5 (1) of the Act which relates to \u201coffences\u201d, \u201cclasses of offences\u201d and \u201cclasses of cases\u201d, construed in the light of the preamble, does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government, but by necessary implication and intendment empowers the State to classify the offences or classes of offences or classes of cases, that is to say, to make a proper classification having a relation to the object of the Act as recited in the preamble; and this part of sec. 5(1) does not therefore contravene Art. 14.  (3) That part of sec. 5(1) which empowers the State Government to direct \u201ccases\u201d as distinct from \u201cclasses of cases\u201d to be tried by the Special Court lies beyond the ambit of the object laid down by the preamble and contemplates and involves a purely arbitrary selection based on nothing more \u2014 substantial than the whim and pleasure of the State Government without any appreciable relation to the necessity for a speedier trial and therefore offends against the provisions of Art. 14 and is void. Bose J\u2014The test under Art. 14 is neither classification nor whether there is absolute equality in any academical sense of the term but whether the collective conscience of a sovereign democratic republic as reflected in the views of fair-minded, reasonable, unbiased men, who are not swayed by emotion or _ prejudice, can consider the impugned laws as reasonable, just and fair and regard them as that equal treatment and protection in the defence of liberties which is expected of a sovereign democratic republic in the conditions which obtain in India today. Patanjali Shastri C.J. (dissenting)\u2014Section 5(1) of the impugned Act is not void or unconstitutional wholly or even in part because: (1) The words in the enacting part of a statute must be confined to that which is the plain object and general intention of the legislature in passing the Act and the preamble affords a good clue to discover what that object was. The title and the preamble of the Act in the present case show unmistakable- ably that the whole object and purpose of the Act was to devise machinery for the speedier trial of certain offences. The discre- tion intended to. be exercised by the State Government must be exercised bona fide on a consideration of the special features or circumstances which call for comparatively prompt disposal of a case or cases proposed to be referred and sec. 5(1) must be read as empowering the Government to direct the Special Court to try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases. as in its judgment, require speedier trial. (2) Article 14 of the Constitution docs not mean that all laws must be general in character and universal in application. The State must possess. the power of distinguishing and classifying persons or things to be subjected to particular laws and in making a classification the legislature must be allowed a wide latitude of discretion and\u2019 judgment. The classification is justified if it is not palpably arbitrary but is founded on a reasonable basis having regard to the object to be attained. (3) The powers of the legislature must include the power of entrusting an administrative body with a plenary but not arbitrary discretion to be exercised so as to carry out the purpose of the Act and the mere fact that the discretion might be exercised arbitrarily by the administrative: body cannot make the law itself unconstitutional. (4) The impugned Act does not in terms or by implication discriminate between: persons or classes of persons nor does it purport to deny to any one equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws. (5): Even from the point of view of reasonable classification the ex- expediency of speedier trial is not too vague or indefinite to be the Basis of classification. (6) The notification of the Government in the present case referring the case to the Special Court did not contravene Art. 14 and is not void inasmuch as there is nothing to show that the Government was influenced by any discriminatory motive or design or acted arbitrarily, but on the other hand there are obviously special features which mark off the group of cases referred as requiring speedier disposal.  Judgment of the Calcutta High court has been affirmed.  "

It cannot be treated as a mere surplussed as it would tend to prejudice a fair consideration of the detente's case by the Advisory Board, though he would have to be released forthwith if the Advisory Board reports that there is no sufficient cause for detention. :  Before a person is deprived of his personal liberty the procedure established by law must be strictly followed and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected.

An omission to administer an oath, even to an adult, goes only to the credibility of the witness and not his competency; so also an omission of the Court or the authority examining a child witness formally to record that in its opinion the witness understands the duty of speaking the truth though he does not understand the nature of an oath or affirmation, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence given by that witness. Though it is desirable that judges .and magistrates should always record their opinion when a child is to be examined that the child understands the duty of speaking the truth, and state why they think so, whether a magistrate or judge was really of that opinion can be gathered from the circumstances when there is no formal certificate to that effect on the record. Mohamed Sugal Esa v. The King (ALR. 1946 P.C. 3), R. v. Sewa Bhogta (14 Beng. L.R. 294 F.N.), Samujh v. Emperor (1907) (10 O. C. 337) referred to. Though a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice, her evidence has been treated by the Courts on somewhat similar lines, and the rule which requires corroboration of such evidence save in exceptional circumstances has now hardened into law.  The rule laid down in King v. Baskerville (L. R. 1916, 2 K.B. 658) with regard to the admissibility of the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is the law in India also so far as accomplices are concerned and it is not any higher in the case of sexual offences. The only clarification of the rule that is necessary for the purposes of India is where this class of offence is tried by a judge without the aid of a jury. In such cases it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had the rule of caution in his mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corroboration in that particular case. There is, however, no rule of law or practice that there must in every case be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand. The view that though corroboration should ordinarily _ be * required in the case of a grown-up woman, it is unnecessary in the case of a child of tender years is not correct. The true position is that in every case of this type the rule about the advisability of corroboration should be present to the mind of the judge; whether corroboration is unnecessary is a question of fact in every case. .. Bishram y. Emperor (AJR. 1944 Nag. 363) not approved; Mohamed Sugal Esa v. The King (AIR. 1946 P.C. 3) followed? The nature and the extent of the corroboration that is required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it, must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It is however clear (i) that it is not-necessary that there should be independent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independent evidence in the case, apart from the testimony of the complainant or accomplice, should itself be sufficient to sustain conviction; all that is required is that there must be \u201csome additional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or the complainant) is true and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it.\u201d; (ii) The independent evidence must not \u2018only make it safe to. believe that the \u2018crime was committed  but must in some way reasonably connect the accused with it; (iii) the corroboration .must come from independent sources and thus ordinarily the testimony of one accomplice would , not be sufficient to corroborate that of another accomplice; (iv) the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed: the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime. : .A previous statement of an accomplice or a complainant is admissible as evidence of conduct; it is also admissible as corroborative evidence provided it fulfills the conditions laid\u2019 down in sec. 157 of the Evidence Act. The main test as to: whether a previous statement was made \u201cat or about the time when the fact took . place\u2019, within the meaning of \u2018sec. 157, Evidence Act, is whether the statement was made as early as can reasonably be expected in the circumstances of the case and before there was an opportunity for tutoring or concoction. Where a person was charged with having committed rape upon a girl eight years of age and the only evidence to corroborate the testimony. of the girl: connecting the accused with the crime was a statement made by her to her mother some four hours after the incident, that she had been raped by the accused : Held,\u2019 that in the circumstances of the case the testimony of the mother was admissible as independent corroborative evidence and the girl\u2019s previous statement was sufficient corroboration of the girl\u2019s testimony for convicting the accused.

Held: by the Full Court\u2014Amongst the Birbhum ghatwals, when the holder of a ghatwali dies leaving a widow but no direct lineal descendants, the widow succeeds in preference to the \u2018nearest male agnate, even though the family may be a joint family. . Per Mahajan and Bose JJ.\u2014The Mitakshara rule that the property inherited by a person from his \u2018immediate paternal ancestors becomes ancestral in his hands, and his sons, grandsons and great-grandsons acquired a right in it at the moment of their birth has no application to Birbhum ghatwali tenures. The word \u201cdescendents\u201d is used in Regulation XXIX of 1814 loosely in the sense of \u201cheirs\u201d and does not mean lineal descendants.  Fazal Ali J.  - Custom and usage are important factors governing succession to ghatwali property, and while in some cases custom may develop on the lines of Hindu law \u2018relating to succession owing to \u2018repeated instances of tacit and unquestioned application of the law, in other cases succession to ghatwali property may be governed not entirely by Hindu law but by such law as modified in certain respects by usage and custom.
