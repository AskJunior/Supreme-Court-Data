Parti\u00ad cularreferenceneed be made only to someof them. Section 19(1) provides: \"Subject to theprovisionsof thisAct, a Corpo\u00b7 ration shallhave power:- (a) .................. .. (b).................. .. (o) to providefor its employeessuitable con\u00ad ditionsof serviceincludingfair wages,establishment ofprovidentfund, living accommodation, places for restand recreation and other amenities\". Section 19(2) exclgding theexplanationto clause (a) and someclauseswith which we are not immedi\u00ad ately concerned,states, \"Subject to theprovisions of thisAct,the powers conferredby sub-section (1) shallinclude power:- (a) to manufacture,purchase, maintain and repair rollingstock, vehicles,appliances,plant, equip\u00ad ment or any otherthingrequiredfor the purpose of any of theactivities of the Corporationreferred to in sub-section(1). 1956 The State of Bombay v.

(d) to purchase by agreement or to take on lease or under any form of tenancy any land and to erect thereon such buildings as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying on its undertaking.\" Tf!.e provisions of the Act read as a whole lead us to the conclusion that if the premisesspecified in the impugned order had been requisitionedfor the Cor\u00ad poration, the requisition would have been for a public purpose. Indeed the learned Judges of the High Court were of this opinion and Mr.Andley did not contend to the contrary. According to him, in this case, the requisition was not for the Corporation but for an employee of the Corporation and forhiscon\u00ad veniencewhich could not be a publicpurpose. The expression'public purpose' has been considered in many cases and it is unnecessary to refer to them except the three casescited by the Attorney-General. In Hamabai's case(') the observation of Batchelor, J. to the effect \"General definitionsare, I think, rather to be avoidedwhere the avoidanceis possible, and I make no attempt to defineprecisely the extent of the phrase 'public purposes' in the lease; it is enough to say that, in my opinion, the phrase, whatever else it may mean, must includea purpose, that is, an object or aim, in which the general interest of the commu\u00ad nity, as opposed to the particular interest of indivi\u00ad duals,is directly and vitally concerned\" received the approval of the Privy Council. Their Lordships,how\u00ad ever, rejected the contention that there cannot bea 'public purpose' in taking land if that land when taken is not in some way or other made -available to the public at large. This contention had beenraised because the Government had resumedlands, which had been the subject of a lease and a sanad, the terms of which permitted the Government to resume the lands for any publicpurpose, with a view to erect (!) [91!1) L.R. 42 I.A. 44. - I ! ' s.c.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 25 thereon dwelling h<;mses for the use of Government officials as their private residence on adequate rent. The concluding portion of the judgment of the Privy Council is important and needs to be quoted. It stated, \"But here,so far from holding them to be wrong, the whole of the learnedjudges, who are thoroughly con\u00ad versant with the conditions of Indian life, say that they are 81).tisfied that the scheme is onewhichwill redound to publicbenefit by helping the Government to maintain the efficiency of its servants. From such a conclusion their Lordshipswould be slow to differ, and upon its own statement it commends itself to their judgment\". In Bhanji Munji' 8 case( 1 ) the requi\u00ad sitionwas forhousinga person having no housing accommodation. After considering the affidavits, the facts and the circumstances of the case,Bose, J. observed \"The Constitution authorizesrequisitionfor apublicpurpose. The purposehere is finding ac\u00ad commodationfor the homeless. If, therefore, a va\u00ad cancy is allotted to a personwho is in fact homeless, the purposeis fulfilled\". In Ali Gulshan'scase(s) the requisitionwas for the purpose of housinga meniber of the staff of a foreignConsulate. This Court held that the requisitionwas for a State purpose,which it is needless to say must beregardedas a public pur\u00ad pose.An examination of these and other cases leads us to the conclusion that it isimpossible to precisely define the expression'public purpose'. In each case all the facts and circumstanceswill require to be closely examined in order to determine whether a 'public purpose' has beenestablished.Prima facie the Government is the best judge as to whether 'public purpose'is served by issuinga requisitionorder, but it is not the sole judge.The courts have the juris\u00ad diction and it is their duty to determine the matter whenevera questionis raised whether a requisition order isoris not fora 'public purpose'. The cases of Hamabai, Bhanji Munji and AliGulshan are merely illustrative. In each of them primarily the person directly and vitallyconcernedwould be the person to whom the residentialaccommodationwould be (1) [1955]1 S.O.R. 777. 4 (2) [1955]2 S.O.R. 867. 1956 The State of Bombay v.

Nanj; Imam}. 26 SUPREMECOURT REPORTS [1956J allotted with which primafacie the generalinterest of the communitywould not be directlyconcerned at all. We must regardHamabai'scase as a decision to the effect that thegeneralinterest of the communitywas directly and vitallyconcernedwith the efficiency of the Government servants because it wouldbe to its benefitto havesuch servants and,therefore, provid\u00ad ing livingaccommodationfor themwas a public pur\u00ad pose.The decisionin Bhanji Munji's case must be readas onein which the generalinterest of the com\u00b7 munity was directly and vitallyconcernedwith pre\u00ad vention of lawlessness and disease and to house the homeless in order to avoidsuch a contingencywas a publicpurpose. In Ali Gulahan's case a State pur\u00ad pose was servedbecausethe State Governmentwas interestedin its own trade or commerceand in the efficientdischarge of his duties by a foreign Consul whowould be concernedwith such trade or com\u00ad merce. In the presentcase it is possible to construe the impugnedorder as a requisitionon behalfof the Cor\u00ad poration as it does not name any individual for whom the requisitionis beingmade. In other words the requisitionedpremises were at the disposal of the Corporation to houseone of its officers to be named later on. Apart from that, thereis a statutory power in the Corporationunder section19(l)(c)of the Act to provideliving accommodationfor its employees and under section 14 the Corporationappoints such numberof its officers and servantsas it considers necessaryfor the efficient performance of its func\u00ad tions. It may be assumed,therefore, that the Cor\u00ad poration appoints only suchofficersas areneededfor the efficientdischarge of its functionsand that the State Governmentwas requested to requisitionsome premisesas livingaccommodationfor one of them whoseposting at Bombaywas necessary.Indeed the affidavit of Mr.Nadkarni,Accommodation Officer of the Government of Bombay, states that the official of the Corporationhas to performhis dutiesin Bom\u00ad bay. Having regard to the provisions of section19(2) (a)and(b) of the Act,the powerin theCorporation - \u2022 I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 27 to provideliving accommodationfor its employees mustbe regardedas one of its statutory activities undersection 19(1). The word'acquire'may include thepowerto purchaseby agreement but is wide enough to enable the Corporation to requestthe State Government to acquirepropertyunder the Land AcquisitionAct (I of 1894) in orderto provideliving accommodation for its employees.The activities of the Corporationunder section 19(1) are so interlinked with its successfulfunctioningas a Road Transport Corporation that requisitioningor acquisitionof pro\u00ad perty to advanceand ensurethose activitiesmust be regarded as for a publicpurpose. It would not be sufficient to merelyestablishthe Corporation. It has to have an adequateand efficientstaff, living ac\u00ad commodationfor whomwouldbe an absoluteneed of the Corporation. Its officershave to be efficientin the discharge of their duties,for uponthemdepends the successfulworking of the road transportsystem uponwhichthe publicmust rely and thus it wouldbe directlyand vitallyconcernedwith the efficiencyof theemployees of the Corporation. It wassuggested that a linemust be drawnsomewhere,otherwise there wasno guarantee to whatlengths the powers of re\u00ad quisitionmight be exercisedby theGovernment. It is sufficientto say that eachcasewouldhave to be decidedupon the factsand thecircumstances ap\u00ad pearingtherein.Here the Corporationis a public utilityconcernand the general interestof the com\u00ad munityis directlyand vitallyconcernedwith its activitiesand its undertaking.A breakdown in the organisationof theCorporation,leading to disloca\u00ad tion of theroadtransportsystem would createa chao\u00ad tic conditionto the detrimentof theinterestof the community.Providing living accommodationfor its employees is a statutory activity of the Corporation and it isessentialfor it to providesuch accommoda\u00ad tion in orderto ensurean efficientworking of the road transport systemand it must, therefore, be held that the impugnedorder was validly passedunder the RequisitionAct. In the result the appealis allowedand the decision 1956 TheState of. Bombay v. R. S. Nanji Imam]. 1956 The State of Bombay v. R. S.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-These petitions under article 32 of the Constitution are filed by the owners of Stage CarriageServices plying their buses on several routes in the districts of the State of Orissa impugning the provisions of Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 and Orissa Act I of 1949 as violative of their fundamental rights. They raise a common question of law and can be disposed of by one judgment. The State of Orissa embarked upona scheme of Nationalised State Transport and, as afirst step towards it, enacted an Act styled the OrissaMotor Vehicles (Regulation of Stage Carriage and Public Carrier's Services) Act, 1947 (Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947), whichmodified the provisions of the Motor VehiclesAct, 1939, for the better regulation of Stage Carriage and Public Carrier's Services in the Province of Orissa. This Act envisaged the formation of a Joint-Stock Company in which the. Central and the Provincial Governmentsshall together have control\u00ad ling interests for providing in stages or in one stage a moreefficient administration of the {lntire stage carriage and public carrier's services in the Province of Orissa. Such a Company was to be authorised to run stage carriage and public carrier's services in the Province of Orissa to the exclusion of all other per\u00ad sons in the routes and areas over which it extended its activities, and with that end in view, the provi\u00ad sions of the MotorVehiclesAct, 1939, were modified as therein specified. Section 4 of the Act provided that the Provincial Government may, if they think fit, by notification direct that the powersconferred by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, on a Provincial Trans\u00ad port Authority or Regional Transport Authority shall S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 31 be held in abeyance with respect to the issue,renewal, t956 suspension or transfer of permits for stage carriage Ram Chandra services and publiccarrier'sservices. Such a notifica- Palai and others tion was to be effectiveaccording to the directions v. either in the whole of the Province or in any speci- The State o/Orissa fied area or in respect of any specified route or routes. and others - _... On the issue of sucha notification, the abovemen- Bhagwatt J. tioned powersconferred on the Provincial Transport - .. - .., Authority or the Regional Transport Authority were to be held in abeyance and all permits issued,renewed or transferred by them were to become inoperative and the ProvincialGovernmentalone was to have the power to issue or renew permits or to grant tem\u00ad porary permits or to suspend or to transfer permits for stage carriageservices and public carrier's services. Whilst the State of Orissa was examining the ques\u00ad tion of the formation of such a Company, the merger of feudatory States of Orissa with the Province of Orissa took place on the lat January, 1948. Some of these Durbars had their own transport services and these were taken over by the State Government of Orissa.Orissa was then divided into 5 zonesfor the purpose of properdevelopment of road transport, viz., Sambalpur, Keonjhar, Koraput, Ganjam and Cuttack zones. It was decided by the Government to nationalise passengerservice transport in the first three zones to be run departmentally based on the nucleus services taken over from the feudatory States which had merged. In order to giveeffect to this decision, the OrissaMotor Vehicles(Amendment) Act,1948 (Orissa Act I of 1949)was enacted which further amended the MotorVehiclesAct, 1939, in the manner therein specified. Section I (3) of that Act provided that the remainingprovisions of the Act shall come into force in such specifiedareas of the district or districts as the Provincial Government may by notificationfrom time to time appoint. The Provincial Government may also by notification with\u00b7 draw the remaining provisions of the Act from any specified areas. It was further provided that 011 and from the date when the remaining provisions of the Act came into force in any specifiedareas, the 32 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 provisions of Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 shall be repealed in respect of the said specified areas and Rarn Chandra Palai and others when the remaining provisions of the Act were with- v. drawn from any specifiedareas, the provisions of TheStateofOrissa Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 shall be deemed to be and others revivedin the said specified areas from the date of publication of the notification of withdrawal. L .. :.: BhagwaliJ. The effect of these provisionswas that in those areas or districts where a notification under section 4(1) of the Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947was not issued, the provisions of the MotorVehiclesAct, 1939, con\u00ad tinued to apply; wheresuch a notificationwas issued, the provisions of Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947came to \u2022 be applied except where, by virtue of the power reserved under section1 of Orissa Act I of 1949, the remaining provisions of that Act were brought into force by a notificationissued in that behalf, in which case the provisions of Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 wererepealed in respect of the said specified areas and the provisions of Orissa Act I of 1949 became applicable.These were the three distinct sets of cir\u00ad cumstances which would prevail at a given time after the enactment of Orissa Act I of 1949 according as the relevant notifications under section4(1) ofOrissa Act XXXVI of 1947 or under section1(4) of Orissa\" Act I of 1949 were issued bringing particular area or areas within the operation of the said respective Acts. Whereas a Joint-Stock Company in which the Central and the Provincial Governments were together to have controlling interests wasenvisaged in Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947, State Transport Service was envisaged in Orissa Act I of IU49 whichdefined State '\"\" Transport Service to mean . a service in which the Orissa State has entire or partial financial interest and which the Provincial Government may by notifi\u00ad cation declare to bea State Transport Service for the purposes of the Act.A Joint-Stock Company was accordingly formed in 1950 which was called the Orissa Road Transport Co., Ltd. The Transport Ser\u00ad viceswhichwere run through the Joint-Stock Com\u00ad pany were termed the \"Rationalised Services\". The > S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 33 Services which were run through the State Transport 1956 Service were termed the \"Nationalised Services\". Ram Chandra In pursuance of the abovescheme of Nationalised Palai and others State Transport, the State Government of Orissa v. issued notifications and press notes which gave in- Th\u2022 state ofOrissa timation to the owners of Stage Carrier Services ope- and othero rating on the severalroutes within the districts of BhagwatiJ. Orissa that with effect from the 1st January 1955 either the Orissa Road Transport Co., Ltd., or the State Transport Service will be operating the said respectiveroutes. That was the occasion for the above petitionsbeing filed by the owners of the Stage Carriage Services plying their buseson the said res- pectiv.eroutes impugningOrissa Act XXXVI of 1947 \u00b7 and Orissa Act I of 1949 as unconstitutional and void as aforesaid. \u00b7 . The petitionsbefore us are not confined to the areas and routeswhereonly Rationalised Services or Nationalised Services arecontemplated to be intro\u00ad duced by the State Government. Petitions Nos. 604 of 1954,648 of 1954, 664 of 1954,666 of 1954 and 671 of 1954 are concernedwith the nationalisation of the services and the routes operatedupon by the peti\u00ad tioners in those petitionsare intended to be served by the State Transport Service. PetitionsNos. 605 of 1954, 647 of 1954,649 of 1954, 663 of 1954 and 665 of 1954 are concerned with the rationalisation of the services and theroutes ope~ated upon by the peti\u00ad tioners in thosepetitions are intended to be served by the OrissaRoad Transport Co .. , Ltd. Petition No. 692 of 1954is not clearwhether the scheme to be put into operationby the State Government in the route operated upon by the petitioner therein is intended to be nationalisedor rationalised. One thing,how\u00ad ever, iscommonbetween all these petitioners that their permitsunder which they have beenoperating their busesupon those routesfor the last several yearsare liable to be either terminatedor cancelled orare not to be renewedunder the scheme of Nation\u00ad alised Road Transport Services andeither the State Government or the Transport Authoritieswill grant the permits on those routes only to the Orissa Road 6 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 Transport Co.

Ram Chantlra f edkd Palal and others The provisionso the impugn Acts were attac e v. on the ground thattherewasdiscriminationin.favour Th\u2022 Slat\u2022 o/ 0,1 .. a of the State Transport Service and the Orissa Road and other\u2022 Transport Co. Ltd. It wasurged that the State could ~ - not discriminateagainst persons in its own favour as BhagwatiJ. wellas in favour of the Joint-Stock Company formed forcarryingon motor transport business as that would be a negation of equality guaranteed under article 14 of the Constitution. It was alsourged that zonal and territorial discrimination in the applica\u00ad tion of the impugnedActs arbitrarily offended against article 14 of the Constitution.A further ground of attack was that the said provisions of the impugned Acts and the rulesframedthereunderinfringed arti\u00ad cle 19(l)(f) and (g) of the Constitution as they put restrictionson tile citizens regarding their rights to hold property and to practice trade or business. Arti\u00ad cle 31(2)was alsoalleged to have beeninfringed be\u00ad cause the GazetteNotification of the State of Orissa purporting to take away the petitioners' motor trans\u00ad port businessamounted to confiscation and the inte- rests of the petitioners in a commercial undertaking \" were purported tobeacquired without making any provisionsfor compensation.The impugnedActs, it was alleged,also violated the guarantee of freedom of inter-State and intra-State trade embodied in arti- cle 301 of the Constitution. Our attention was drawn to the relevant provisions of the MotorVehiclesAct, 1939, Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 and Orissa Act I of 1949regarding the issue ~~ and renewal of permits.Under the Motor Vehicles Act,1939, the Provincial Transport Authority and the Regional Tran11port Authority wereinvestedwith the requisitepowers in this behalf. Sections 47 and 55 prescribed the matters to be \u00b7considered by the Regional Transport Authority in consideringapplica- tions for stage carriage permits and public carrier's permits and section 58 providedfor the dura~ion and renewal of permits. So far as renewals of permits were concerned, it wasprovided that, other conditions S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 35 being equal,applicationsfor renewalshall be given 1956 preferenceover new applicationsfor permits.When Ram Chandra a notificationwas issued under section4(1) of Palai and others Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947, the powers conferredon v. the Provincial Transport Authority or the.Regional Th\u2022 State of Orissa Transport Authorityby the Motor VehiclesAct, andothers 1939, were held in abeyance and the ProvincialGov- ernment alone was invested with the power to issue Bhagwati J. or renewpermits. In the grantingor refusing to grant suchpermits, the ProvincialGovernmentwas not bound to take into consideration the matters specified in sections 47 or 55 of the Mot.or Vehicles Act,1939.The ProvincialGovernmentwas also authorised by notificationto cancel any permit grant- edunder the MotorVehiclesAct, 1939, without following the provisions of section 60 of that Act. The only provisionwhich was madein section6 of Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 in this behalfwas that when a permitbecameinoperativeunder section4(2) orwascancelledunder section5 of that Act, compen- sation as thereinprescribedwas payableto suchper- mit holder. Sections3 and 4 of Orissa Act I of 1949addedtwo further clauses to sections 47 and 55 of the Motor VehiclesAct, 1939,viz., \"(g) otherconditionsbeing equal,in the interest of properco-ordination of transport facilities, the ex\u00ad pediency of giving due consideration to a State Trans\u00ad port Service; (h) the necessityfor preventing unhealthy com\u00ad petition in any routeor routesor areaon which the State Transport Service may ply;\" It waspointed out that the wholescheme of Orissa Act XXXVI of 1947 and Orissa Act I of 1949 was to oust the owners of stagecarriageservice from busi\u00ad ness and create a virtual monopolyin favour of the Orissa Road Transport Co. Ltd. or the State Trans\u00ad port Service and thus discriminateagainst persons in favour of the Joint-Stock Companyor the State.

The Judgment of the Court wasdelivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-These are five petitions under article 32 of the Constitution by the heads of five Maths in the State of Orissa of whichfour knownas Mahiparakash Math, Uttaraparswa Math, Dakshina\u00ad parswa Math and Radhakant Math are situated in Puri and the fifth known as Manapur Math is near Tirtol in Cuttack district. In all these petitions certain provisions of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1951 (OrissaAct II of 1952) as amended by Orissa Act XVIII of 1954 are challenged asbeing unconstitutional and ultravires. Since the questionsraised are mostly common,all the petitions are dealt with by this singlejudgment. These petitions have abackground of previous his\u00ad tory of legislation and litigation which it isnecessary to set out in order that the questionsraised may be properly appreciated.The first statutory interference by the Provincial Legislature with the management of Hindu religiousendowments in Orissa was by the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1939 (Orissa Act IV of 1939) whichcame into operation 46 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 1956 on the 31st August, 1939. This wasmodelled on a Sri Sadasib similarAct operating in the Province of Madras at Prakash the time. The validity of the Act as a whole as also Brahmaahari of certain provisions thereof werechallenged by the v. Mahan ts of the various Maths in Orissa, about 30 in Tho State of Orissa number, by instituting a suit in the year 1940. The - suit wason behalf of the individual Maths who Jagannadhadas J, fi d J f gure as p aintiffs(including three o the present petitioners, viz. Mahants of Mahiparakash Math, Dakshinaparswa Math and Radhakanta Math) and also in a representative capacity under Order I, rule 8 of the Civil Procedure Code. (Vide printed record of this Court in Case No. 1 of 1950). That suit was dismissed by the District Judge of Cuttack and came up in appeal to the High Court of Orissa. The High Court upheld the validity of the Act. and of the varioussections thereof by its judgment dated the 13th September, 1949, whichis reported in Mahant Sri GadadharRamanuj Das v. The Province of Orissa(1). An appeal was filed therefrom to the Supreme Court in January, 1950,whichwas numbered as Case No. 1 of 1950.This appeal remained pendingfor over four years and came up for final hearing in February, 1954. During the period of pendency of the appeal the Orissa Legislature passedtwo further Acts relat\u00ad ing to Hindu religiousendowments.The first of them was Orissa Act II of 1952whichwas an Act to \"amend and \u00b7consolidate the law relating to the ad\u00ad ministration and governance of Hindu religious in\u00ad stitutions and endowments in the State of Orissa\" and which on its coming into force was intended to repeal the pre-existing Orissa Act IV of 1939. This Act becamelaw on the 16th February, 1952, by the assent of the President. It did not howevercome into force at once on account of sub-section (3) of section I therein which provided that the Act is to \"come into force on such date as the State Govern\u00ad ment may, by notification, direct\". No such notifi\u00ad cation was issued during the pendency of the appeal in the Supreme Court. This Act was,in fact, brought into force much later, i.e., only as from the 1st Janu- (1) I.L.R.

Prakash While thus the 1952 Act remainedon the statute Bralimachari book without its coming into force, other indepen- v. . dent statutory provisionsamending the Act of 1939 The State 01 Orissa werepassed and brought into operation.The first of J -;;; a 1 them was Orissa OrdinanceNo. II of 1953 whichwas aganna ia \"s \u2022 promulgatedby the Governoii of Orissa on the 16th May, 1953. This was later superseded and substituted by Orissa Act XVIII of 1953 whichcame into opera- tion on the 28th October,1953. By these two suc- cessive Jegislative measures, the Act of 1939was amended in certainrespects and it is the Act so amended that was in operationduring the period fromMay,1953 to March,1954, falling within the later portion of the pendency of Case No. 1of1950in the Supreme Court. Some time in 1953, subsequent to the month of May, the Commissioner of Hindu ReligiousEndowments, Orissa, appears to have init- iated proceedingsfor the framing of schemes in res- pect of anumber of Maths, and schemeswere ac- tually framedduringthis periodas regardsthe four Maths,Mahiparakash, Uttaraparswa, Dakshina- parswa and Radhakanta comprised in Petitions Nos. 651of1954, 49, 46 and 51of1955, respectively.These schemeswere brought into operation and the ad- ministration of some of these Mathswas taken over by the Trusteesunder the schemes. Thereafter Mahants of three of the affected Maths, Mahipara- kash, Uttaraparswa and Radhakanta, whoare also petitioners beforeus, filedapplicationsunder article 226before the High Court of Orissa challenging the validity of the schemes.Those applicationswere dis- missedby the High Court on the 17th February, \u00b71954. Meanwhile the Mahant of Dakshinaparswa Math who wasa petitionerin the High Court and also before us,filedalongwith another Mahant, a petition under article32 of the Constitution to this Court on the 23rdDecember,1953, challenging the Act then in force as being in violation of their fundamental rights. Thiswas Petition No. 405 of 1953. This petition as 48 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 1956 wellas Case No. 1 of 1950, referred to above, came Sri Sadasib up for hearing, together, in this Court on the 9th, I 0th Prakash and 11th February, 1954. Judgment of this Court Brahmachari therein was delivered on the 16th March,1954, and is v. reported in Mahant Sri J agannath Ramanuj Das v. The The State o/Orissa State of Orissa('). Asa result thereof,sections38 and - 39 of Orissa Act IV of 1939 as amended in 1953, under JagannadhadasJ, which the schemeswere framedwere declareduncon- stitutional. Accordihgly, the schemes became invalid and therefore the possession of such of the Maths which had been taken over under the schemes wasre\u00ad stored to the Mahants. (It may be mentioned in passing, in this context, that the judgment of this Court refers to Orissa Act II of 1952 as being the one in force at the time and whose provisionswere under consideration by the Court. This is a slip. The Act then in forcewas, as already stated, the Act of 1939 as amended in 1953. That this is a slip in the judg\u00ad ment is admitted beforeus. That does not however in any way detract from the reasoning and the bind\u00ad ing character of the judgment, since as a fact what were really referred to were the sections of the 1939 . Act as amended in 1953).Now, after the judgment of this Court was delivered in March,1954, the Orissa .Legislature again intervened and passed another Act, Orissa A{)t XVIII of 1954. This Act purported to amend not the 1939 Act which was by then in opera\u00ad tion but the 1952 Act which had not by then come into force. Orissa Act XVIII of 1954 received the assent of the President on the 2nd December,1954; and came into force at once and therefore Orissa Act II of 1952 became pro tanto amended and modified. By that date the 1952 Act so amended was awaiting the issue of notification under section 1(3) thereof for being brought into force. This notification, as already stated, was ultimately issued on the 22ndDecember, 1954, bringing Orissa Act II of 1952 as amended by Act XVIII of 1954 into force from the 1st January, 1955, and thereby repealing Orissa Act IV of 1939 as amended in 1953. The first of the petitions before us relating to Mahiparakash Math was filed in this (!) [1954] S.C R. !046 . - ... - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 49 Court, anticipating this notification,while the other 7956 four werefiled after the notificationwas issued.As Sri Sadasib already stated, all these petitions challenge the Prakash validity of varioussections of Act II of 1952 as Brahmachari amended in 1954(hereinafterreferred to as the v. - ,, present Act). The challengeis entirely based upon the Tile State of Orissa principleslaid downbv this Court in Mahant Sri J -;;;: a 1 JagannathRarnanuj Das;,., The State of Orissa(1). The aganna a as \u2022 aboveis the history of the relevant legislation and the connectedparallel litigation. The main attack is in respect of sections 42 and 79-A of the present Act relating to the schemesfor religious institutions of the kind with which we are concerned in thesepetitions.There can be no doubt that the two sections apply to theseMaths.The phrase \"religious institution\" occurring 'in section 42 has been definedas meaning(also) \"a math and endowments attached thereto\". A Mathis \"an institu\u00ad tion .... succession to the headship of whichdevolvesin accordancewith the directicins of the founder or is regulated by custom\" and a hered\u00ad itary trustee is \"a trustee of an institution succes\u00ad sion to whoseoffice devolves.... .... by custom or is specificallyprovided for by the founder\". A Math is thereforea religious institution presidedover or managed \u00b7by a hereditary trustee so as to render section42(l)(b)applicable.To appreciate the ground of attack it is necessary to trace the changes in the provisions relating to the framing of schemesfor such institutions in the successivelegislativemeasures. In the Act as it stood in 1939 the provisions i11 this .. ,:.. behalf are sections38, 39 and 40.Since the attack is mainly as regards the procedurefor the framing of the scheme, it is sufficient to notice what the gist of these three provisionsis inso far as it relates to the procedurefor an enquiry to frame a scheme. Under these three sections the enquiry is to beheld by the Commissionerfor Endowmentsappointed under the Act. For this purposehe is to function jointly with one or morepersons in the service of the Crown appointed by the ProvincialGovernment in (1) [1954] S.C.R.1046. 7 50 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 this behalf. The enquiry has to be conducted \"in such manner as may be prescribed''. In making the S1\u00b7i Sat!asib Prakash enquiry the Commissioner and the person or persons Brailmacharl associated with him therein are to consult the trustee v. and the persons having interest. After the scheme is The Stat' of Orissa settled and the order determining the schemeis ' - - published in the prescribed manner the trustee or any JagauuadlladasJ. person having interest may, within six months of the date of suchpublication, institute a suit in the court to modify or set asidesuch order. The order sett.ling a schemeis final and binding on the trustee and all persons having interest, subject to the result of the suit, if any, as above mentioned. Of course, the result of the suit itself would, under the generallaw, be subject to further appeal under the Civil Procedure Code in the ordinary way. Changeswere made in these provisionsin 1953first by Orissa Ordinance II of 1953 and then by Orissa Act XVIII of 1953 as already stated. The modifica\u00ad tion i~ that sub-section(4) of section 39 which pro\u00ad vided for a right of suit, by the trustee or the person interested, in the regular civil court (with the con\u00ad comitant further appeals to higher courts) was deleted and the followingwas substituted as sub-section (4) of section 39; \"Every order under this section shall be published in the \u00b7 prescribed manner and the order so passed shall be final and binding on the trustee and all per\u00ad sons having interest''. Asa consequence thereof section 40 of the 1939 Act, which stated that \"subject to the result of the suit the order settling aschemeis final\", was omitted. ,... \u2022 The result of these two changes was that once the Commissioner with the assistance of one or more Government officerswho were to be specially.nomi- nated, settled a scheme after making the prescribed enquiry, that order was not open to any further ques- tion or correction in the ordinary courts. It was at this stage that the validity of the provisions relating to the framing of a scheme came up forconsidera- tion before this Court in March,1954. This Court held that the legislation in so far as it authorised the - >\u00b7 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 51 framing of a scheme by the Commissioner along with 7956 his associates and declared such determination as Sri Sadasib final without any scope for correction thereof by Prakash judicial intervention, was an unreasonable restriction BrahmacliMi on the right of the head of the Math with reference v. to his interest in the Math. Accordingly sections 38 The State of Orissa and 39 of the Act then in force were struck down as - t\"t t\" ld \u2022 l\"d Th t \u2022 \u00b7 JagannadhadasJ. uncons i u 10na an mva i . e presen prov1s10ns which are the result of a later amendment are con- tained in sections 42 and 44 of the present Act and are substantially different. The relevant portions thereof are as follows: \"42. (1) Whenever there is reason to believe that in the interest of the proper administration of religious institution ascheme may be settled for it, or when not less than five persons having interest make an application in writing stating that in the interests of the proper administration of areligious institution a scheme should be settled for it, the Assistant Commissioner or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall proceed to frame a scheme in the manners hereinafter provided- ( a)............................

(7) Every order of................ the Commissioner sE)ttling ascheme under this section shall, subject to the provisions of section 44, be binding on the trustee, the Executive Officer and all persons having interest. 44.(1) ............................. 52 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] t9s6 (2) Any party aggrieved by the order of the Sri Sadasib Commissioner under sub-section (I) of section 42 may Prakash appeal to the High Court within thirty days from the Brahmachari date of the order or publication thereof as the case v. may be\". The State ofOrissa The effect of these provisions of the present Act is JagannadhadasJ. (I) that a schemecan be framed by the Commissiouer alone on a report of the Assistant Commissioner on such enquiry as he thinks fit and not by the Commis\u00ad sionerin association with one or more Government officers to be appointed for the purpose by the Gov\u00ad ernment, (2) that there is no right of suit forchalleng\u00ad ing the validity or the correctness of the scheme framed by the Commissioner but there is only an appeal to the High Court direct. It is.urged that theseprovisionsstill continue to be unreasonable restrictions on the rights of the Mathadipathi and are accordingly ultra vires and unconstitutional. In the case reported in the Commissioner, HinduReli\u00ad giousEndowments,Madras v. Sri LakshmindraThirtha Swamiarof Sri ShirurMutth(') the interest of Mathadi\u00ad pathi in the Math has been recognised as property fall\u00ad ing within the scope of article 19(I)(f) of the Consti\u00ad tution. It was recognised that the ingredients, of office and property, of duties and personal interest, are blended> together in the rights of a Mahant and that the Mahant has the right to enjoy the property or the beneficial interest so longas heis entitled to hold hisoffice. It wasrecognised that the beneficialin\u00ad terest which the Mahant enjoys is appurtenant to his duties and that as he is in charge of a public institu\u00ad tion,reasonable restrictions can alwaysbe placed upon his rights in the interests of the public. It was howeverheld therein that provisionsfor the framing of a schemewhich by its terms operate by way of unreasonable restriction would be unconstitutional and invalid. It is this principle that was applied in the next decision of this Court relating to Orissa Maths in MahantSriJagannathRamanuj Das v. The State of Orissa(\"). There, the validity of the then provisions of the Act, i.e., of sections38 and 39 of (1) [1954) S.C.R. 1005. 12) [1954] S.C.R. 1046. .. - - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 53 Orissa Act IV of 1939 as amended in 1953 was ad- 1956 judged in the followingterms: Sri Sadasib \"Sections 38 and 39 relate to the framing of a Prakash scheme. The scheme can certainly be settled to en- Brahmachari sure due administration of the endowed property v. . but the objectionseems to be that the Act provides for TheStat\u2022 o/Orissa the framing of a scheme not bya civil court or under JagannadhadasJ. its supervision but by the Commissioner,who is a mere administrative or executiveofficer. There is also no provisionfor appeal against his order to the court ............ We think that the settling of a schemein regard to a religious institution by an executiveofficer without the intervention of any judicial tribunal amounts to an unreasonable restriction upon theright of property of the superior of the religious institution which is blended with hisoffice.Sections38 and 39 of the Act must, therefore, be held to be invalid\". It is urged that though the obviouspurpose of the amending Act of 1954 passed after this decision by the SupremeCourt, was to remedy the defect above pointed out by providing for a right of appeal direct to the High Court from the determination of the Com\u00ad missioner settling the scheme, the present provisions still continue to be unreasonable restrictions on the right of property of the Mahant. It is further urged that the initial decision in a scheme-proceedingis still on the basis of an executive enquiry by an exe\u00ad cutive officer and that in any case a direct appeal to the High Court as against the Commissioner's order cannot be as adequate a safeguard regarding the rights of the Mahan ts, as a suit and a right of appeal therefrom in the ordinary course to the higher courts wouldbe. It is undoubtedly true that from a litigant's point of view an appeal to the High Court from the Commissioner's order is not the same as, an indepen\u00ad dent right of suit and an appeal to the higher courts from the result of that suit. But in order to judge whether the provisions in the present Act operate by way of unreasonable restrictionfor constitutional purposes what is to be seenis whether the person affected gets a reasonablechance of presenting his entire case before the original tribunal which has to 54 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] determine judicially the questions raised and whether he hasa regular appeal to the ordinarily constituted Sri Sadasib Prakash court or courts to correct the errors, if any, of the 1956 Brahmachari tribunal of first instance. For that purpose it is rele- v. vant to notice that in the present Act, the Commis- The State 01 Orissa sioner of Endowments .has, by virtue of section 4 there- ; dh d I of, to bea member of the Judicial Service (of the State) aganna a as .. not bemg below the rank of a Subordinate Judge, while under section7 of Act IV of 1939 a Commis- sioner of Endowments couldbe a person of either the judicial or\u00b7 the executiveservice and that even where a member of the judicialservice is appointed he may be a person below the rank of a Subordinate Judge. Another important difference has also to be noticed, viz., that while under section 38 of the previous Act the enquiry has to be conducted \"in such manner as may be prescribed\" which means as prescribed by the Provincial Government by rulesmade under the Act and hencechangeable by the Government, under the present Act, section42(1) (b) specificallyenjoins that \"the Commissioner shall hold an enquiry in the manner prescribed and so far as may be in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to the trial of suits\". It may also be noticed that before the Commissioner starts his enquiry it is expected that the Assistant Commissioner, who, by v'irtue of section5(2), is to be a person holding a judicialoffice not lower in rank than that of a Munsif, is to make such enquiry ashe thinks fit and submit his report. Thus in the initial stage of the framing of the scheme under the provisions of the present Act there is first of all something in the nature of a preli\u00ad minary enquiry by a judicialofficer of the rank of a Munsif and this is followed by a regular and full en\u00ad quiry before the Commissioner whois of the rank of a Subordinate Judge. The enquiry before the Com\u00ad missioneris assimilated to and is governed by the provisions relating to the trial of suits by enjoining that, as far as may be, it is to be in accordance .with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure relating to trial of suits. While,therefore, under the prior Act the enquiry before the Commissioner might well ' - - - \"' - _, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 55 have been of the nature of an executive enquiry by 1956 an executiveofficer, the enquiry under the present Sri Sadasib Actis by itself in the nature of a judicialenquiry by Prakash judicialofficers followed up by a right of regular Brahmachari appeal to the High Court. A schellle framed with v. reference to such a procedure cannot ipso facto be TheState 01 Orissa pr.on~mnced tho b~ 1h'n thef hnatMurehofut nrTeahso 1na~1 1e tres- Jagann:;;:adasJ. trict10n on te rig ts otea an .e eg1s a ure. might well have thought that, instead of mak'.ing the enquiry before the Commissioner more or less in the nature of a preliminaryexecutive enquiry to be followed up by the affected Mahant by way of a regular suit in the CivilCourt, it is muchmore satis\u00ad factory and in the publicinterests, to impress the en- quirybefore the Commissionerhimself with the stamp of greater seriousness and effectiveness and to assimi- late the same to a regular enquiry by the judicial officeraccording to judicialprocedure and then to provide a right of direct appeal to the High Court .. It has been strongly urged that a mere right to appeal to the High Court would virtually be in the nature of a limited appeal confined to challengeonly on certain basic matters and probably limited to questions of law.We canfindno warrant for any suchapprehension. The right of appealis given in verywide and generalterms.Obviously the appeal can be both on facts and on law and would relate not merely to the merits of the sche:r\u00b5e but also to all basic matters whose determination isimplicit in the veryframing of a scheme. In our opinion the pre\u00ad sent provisions cannot be struck downas being in the nature of unreasonablerestriction on the rights of the Mahant. Two other minor provisions in this connection have been brought to our notice and relied upon as indicating unreasonable restriction on the rights. One is that while under the 1939 Act the period of limitation for a right of suit wassix months, the period allowedfor an appeal\u00b7 under the present Act is only 30 days. Another is that under section 74(3) the operation of the order of the Commissioneris not to be stayed pending the disposal of the appeal. It 56 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 has been urged that these provisions operate very harshly against the Mahant affected by a scheme Sri Sadasib Prakash whenframed. It is pointed out that as the result of Brahmachari a schemebeing put into operation immediately, the v. \u6c0c\u6168\u616e\u7420 may be deprived of the effectivepossession The State of Orissa of the Math and hence of the wherewithal to file an \u00b7- appeal within the very short time that is allowed, as Jagamia~hadasJ. also of the resourcesto conduct the appeal in tbe High Court or to maintain himself during its pendency which may take years. There is not much force in this contention. In so far as the question of filing of an appeal is concerned, there shouldbe nodiffi\u00ad culty since the provisions relating to appeals in forma pauperis wouldbe applicable and can be availed of if the circumstancescall for it. In so far as any situa\u00ad tion may arise which may call for financialfacilities for the conducting of the appeal or for interim main\u00ad tenance, the learned Attorney-General suggests that the appellate Court would have inherent power and discretion to give appropriate directions for supply of funds out of the trust estate and that, in any view, suchpower and discretion have to be implied in the provisionfor an appeal so that the said right of appeal may not become illusory. Having regard to the suggestion thus put forwa~d, which we accept, we cannot hold that the provision in section74(3) that the operation of the order of the Commissioner framing a schemeis not to be stayed pending the disposal of the appeal, brings about an unreasonable restriction. In this view we think that the inci\u00ad dental provisionsabove referred to\u00b7 do not in any way detract from the reasonableness of the main provisions. In our opinion, therefore, the provi\u00ad sions in the present Act of 1952 as amended in 1954, relating to the framing of schemes are not open to any of the constitutional objections raised; and are valid. The next point that has beenurged, depends on the fact that in four of the petitions beforeus relat\u00ad ing to the Maths of llfahiparakash, Uttaraparswa, Dakshinaparswa and Radhakanta, schemeswere in fact framed in the year 1953 under the provisions of . ' -- -1 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 57 Orissa Act IV of 1939 as amended in 1953. It may 7956 be recalled that these provisionswere held invalid Sri Sadasib by the decision of this Court in March,1954, Prakash above referredto. It must therefore be taken that Brahmachart these schemeswere void as the law then stood. It v. is with reference to that situation that the Orissa The State of Orissa Legislature by an amendment in 1954 of the 1952- Act introduced section 79-A into this Act which runs JagannadhadasJ. as follows: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in any of the other provisions of this Act or in any judgment, decree or order of any court all schemes purporting to have been settled in pursuance of sections38 and 39 of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act, 1939, after the commencement of the Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments (Amendment)Ordinance, 1953, and before the commencement of this Act shall bedeemed to have been settled under the provisions of this Act and any personaggrieved by any such scheme may within sixty days from the date of com\u00ad mencement of this Actprefer an appeal to the High Court and such appeal shallbe dealt with and dis\u00ad posed of in the same manner as appeals providedfor under sub-section(2) of section 44\". This purports to revive the schemes which were pro\u00ad nounced to be invalid by the judgment of this Court and attempts to remove the defectnoticed in the judgment of this Court by providing for a regular appeal to the High Court against that very scheme within 60 days from the date of the commencement of the Act. It may be noticed that the schemesso revived are onlythosewhich were settled after the commencement of Orissa Hindu Religious Endow\u00ad ments (Amendment) Ordinance, 1953, and before the commencement of the 1952 Act,i.e., between 16th May,1953 to 31st December,1954, (hereinafter ref\u00ad erred to as the specifiedperiod). This was exactly the period within which the amendment of l939 Act made in 1953 was in force,abolishing the right of suit and making the scheme as determined by the Commissionerfinal and conclusive. Section 79-A in terms purports to revive the invalid scheme notwith- e 58 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 standing any judgment, decree or order of any court, which means that though a court may have pro- 5~,!~~;;,ib nolinced the scheme as voif still that is deemed to be Brahmachari alive. It has beensuggested that this is directly v. flouting the decision of this Court and that the legis- Tlie State of Orissa lature has no power to declareas valid and constitu- - tional what was decided by this Court as invalid and JagannadhadasJ. unconstitutional. But it is tobeobserved that the legislaturedoes not purport to do anything of the kind. What it does is not to deem the schemes pre\u00ad viously settled as having been validly settled on those very dates, under the then existing law. This of courseis beyond legislativecompetencesince the legislature has not the power to override unconsti\u00ad tutionality as such. But what the legislature has purported to do is to take up those very schemes and . deem them to have been settled under the provisions of the presentAct and thereby to Jay them open to any attack available under the present law. Such a pro\u00ad vision is not uncommon in legislative practice, and is enacted in order to avoid the publicinconvenience of having to re-do what has previouslybeen done. The result of section79-A is to treat the schemes framed within the specified period as schemes framed immediately after the commencement of the present Act and to impute thereto, by a fiction,compliance with the various procedural and other steps which are requisite under section 42. We can see no reason for thinking that such a provisionis not within the competence of the Legislature. It has beensuggested that this is really interfering with the jurisdiction of this Court under article 32. But there is no substance in that suggestion. The right of any person to,seek remedy under article 32 in respect of any violation of his fundamental rights isin no way curtailed or affected by the fact that a.n actual decision of this Court on an application under article 32 is, in effect, nullified by appropriate and competent legislative measures. Indeed, the right h!!,s been, in fa.ct, suc\u00ad cessfully invoked on the prior occasion and ha.a again been invoked on the present occasion. If it fails this time it is not because the right and the remedy under I ' - I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 59 article 32 have been taken away or affected but be- 1956 cause the unconstitutionality has beenremoved. Sec- Sri Sadasib tion 79-A,therefore,is not open to any objection on Prakash the ground of legislativeincompetence. Brahmachari It has further been urged that to treat the scheme v. prepared with reference to the Act of 1939 as amend- The State 0/0rissa ed in 1953 as a scheme prepared under the present J -dh d J Ab f fi ..ll . th f agannaa as \u2022 ct y means 0 a ct10n JS rra y lil e nature 0 deprivation of certain advantages which an aggrieved personwould have had if in fact the scheme was settled under the present Act, and that thereforesuch a scheme would still operate by way of unreasonable restriction.This contention is also without substance. It is true that in the present Act the procedure relat- ing to the scheme has fourstepswhich are as follows: (I) The schemeis to be framed by a Commis\u00ad sioner,who is, by appointment, a judicialofficer. (2) The procedureis, as far as may be, the same as that in the trial of suits. (3) There is a preliminary enquiry by the Assist\u00ad ant Commissioner. (4) There is an appeal t.o the High Court. Out of thesefour, the substantial item is the last one and that has beenspecificallyprovided for under sec\u00ad tion 79-A and a period of sixty days from the date of the commencement of the Act hasbeenprovidedfor the right of appeal.There can be nocomplainton this score. It is true that the schemes under the Act then in operation, i.e., during the specifiedperiod, might possibly have been framed by (a) an executiveofficer, as also (b) in pursuance of procedure under the rules framed by the ExecutiveGovernmentwhich may not approximate to that of a trial of a suit. But this wasmerelya theoreticalpossibility. In fact, as appears from the record and, as has been stated to us by the learned Attorney-Generalon behalf of the State and not disputed on the other side, the Endow\u00ad ment Commissioner during the specified period was a Subordinate Judge of the Orissa Judicial Service. The actual procedure whichwas in foree at the time under the rules as then prescribedwas also in fact in 60 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 consonance with the trial of suits. under the Civil Sri Sadasib Procedure Code. This appears clearly from rules 51 Prakash to 109 of the Rules framed by the Government- of Brahmachari Orissa, an official copy of which has been supplied to v. us in court by the learnedAttorney-General on be- Th\u2022 State of Orissa half of the State. As regards the provision .that the - enquiry by the Commissioner under the present Act JagannadhadasJ. has to be preceded by a preliminary enquiry by an Assistant Commissi9ner whois of the rank of a Mun\u00ad sif, the argument that the deprivation of this feature by the deemingprovision in section 79-A operates to the disadvantage of the Mahan ts is not by any means a serious point. It is to be noticed that this is set\u00ad off by the fact that schemes under the 1939 Act are framed not by the Commissioneralone but along with one or more Government officers appointed by the Government.We are,therefore,unable to up\u00ad hold the contention that the deemingprovision under section 79-A which treats the previousschemes as schemes framed under the present Act results in bringing about any substantial disadvantages to the detriment of the Mahants. We accordinglyhold that section 79-A of the present Act is not open to any con\u00ad stitutional objection. Weare, therefore, clearly of the opinion that sec\u00ad tions 42(l)(b), 42(7) and 44(2) as wellas section 79-A of the present Act are not open to the consti- tutional objectionsraised beforeus. . It may be mentioned that in the petitions before us some other provisions of the present Act have also beenchallengedas being unconstitutional. But no arguments have been advanced beforeus in respect , _ thereof. It may also be mentioned that the peti- tions beforeus have not raised any questions relating to the merits of the scheme in so far as any specific provisions thereof may have operated by way of un\u00ad reasonable restrictions, in the light of the considera- tions pointed out by this Court in its judgment in the Gommisijioner, HinduReligiousEndowments,Madras v. Sri Lnkshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutth('). Nor does it appear that any appeal as (l) (1954] S C.R. 1005. . , -> S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 61 provided in section79-A has beenfiled to the High ma Court in respect of thesecases challenging the vali- Sri Sadasib dity or the propriety of the variousprovisions in the Prakash scheme or correctness of the decision,express or Brahmachari implied, on the basic facts whichare the foundation v. of the schemeproceedings.We expressno opinion The State of Orissa on any of these matters. h da In the last of the petitions relating to Manapur Jagannad a sJ. Math, the facts appear to be slightlydissimilar but this makes no substantial or materialdifference. In that case the original scheme was one framedunder sections38 and 39 of the 1939 Act as they stood be\u00ad foretheiramendmentin 1953whichprovidedfor a right of suit.The schemeitself was dated the 22nd May,1948.Previous to the framing of the scheme there appears to have been a claim by the Mahant that the institution wasa private one and not a public one and that it did not fulfil the definition of the word \"Math\" under the Act.Thereappears to have been a compromisebetween the then Mahant and the public of the village in which the Math is situated, who wereinterested in the Math.The compromise was to the effect that the institution was to be declareda Math but that the then Mahant was to be recognised as the hereditarytrustee thereof.This compromisewas recognisedby the Commissioner by his order dated the 12thMay,1947, formallymaking the above declarations. It waR 0):1: the basis of this that, later on, a schemewas framedon the 22nd May, 1948. It does not appear that the Mahantfiled any suit which was then available to him. But it is stated to us by the learnedAdvocateappearingfor tlie peti\u00ad tioner that an applicationwas filed in the High Court for a writ to quash the scheme, and that it was dis\u00ad missed by the High Court on the 16thNovember, 1954. The schemebecame final under the original Act of 1939 as it stoodbefore the 1953 amendment. Obviously,with reference to the facts of such a case, no argument of the kind that hasbeenaddressed to us in the other four petitionswas available. In the result,therefore,all the five petitions must be dismissedwith costs."

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 206 of 1955. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 63 On appeal from the judgment and order dated 7956 the 5th May 1954 of the Patna High Court in Appeal Jai Narain Ram from the OriginalOrder No. 284 of 1951arising out Lundia of the order dated the 11th July 1951 of the Court of v. Subordinate Judge, Motihari in Misc. Case No. 30 of KedarNath 1951. Khetan at1d others Veda, Vyas,(S. K. Kapur and GanpatRai, with him) for the appellant. 0. K. Daphtary,Solicitor-Generalof India (K. B. Asthana and 0. P. Lal, with him) for respondent No. 1. 1956. January 31. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BosE J.-This appeal arises out of certain execu\u00ad tion proceedings. The decreewhich the appellant, J ainarain 'Ram Lundia,seeks to execute is one that directsspecificperformance of a contract to sell certain shares in a private limitedcompany known as the Ganga I)evi Sugar Mills, together with a five annas share in a partnership firmcalled the Mai:wari Brothers, on payment of a sum of Rs. 2,45,000. The facts are as follows. The partnership firm, knownas the Marwari Brothers, was formedon the 29th of February 1936. The partners consisted of two groupscalled the Bettia Group and the Padrauna Group. The Padrauna Group consisted of (1) Kedar\u00ad nath Khetan and (2) a firmcalled Surajmal. Thef;!e two were the plaintiffsin the suit. Kedarnath was on~ of the partners of the Surajmal firm. The Bettia Group consisted of (1) Gobardhan Das (2) Jainarain Ram Lundia (3) Badri Prasad and (4) Bisheshwar Nath. On Bisheshwar Nath's death his son Madan Lal Jhunjhunwalla stepped into his shoes.These per\u00ad sonswere the defendants. The Marwari Brothers :Firm was formedfor the purpose of promoting a companyfor starting a sugar mill in Cbamparan and for securing the managing agency of the company for itself for a period of ninety years.This was done. The capital of the company consisted of Rs. 8,00,000 divided into 800 shares of 1956 J ai Narain Ram Lundia v. KedarNath Khetan and others Bose}. 64 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] Rs.1,000 each. The shares were distributed as follows. In the Bettia Group Gobardhan Das and his brother Badri Prasad had 100 shares; Jainarain had 150 and Madan Lal had 100. The Bettia Group thus had 350 shares between them. The other group (Padrauna) held the remaining 450 shares. About five years later the twosets of partners fell out and, as a result, the Bettia Groupagreed, on 1-1-1941, to sell a certain number of their shares in the Ganga Devi Sugar Mills Limited to the Padrauna Groupalong with a certain share in the Marwari Brothers firm. The exact number of shares agreed to be sold and the extent of the share in the firmwas a matter of dispute but that does not concernus at this stage becausewe are only concerned with the final result embodied in the decreenow under execution. T}le Padrauna Group sued for specific performance and the dispute was carried as far-as the Federal Court. That Court affirmed the decree of the Calcutta High Court on 6-5-1949. The substance of the decree wasthis: I. \"It is declared that upon payment and or tender to the defendants-appellants Jainarain Ram Lundia and Madan Lal Jhunjhunwala of the sum of Rs. 2,45,000 ........ with interest thereon ........ by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are entitled to 250 shares belonging to the said defendants in the Ganga Devi Sugar Mills Limited and five aunasshare belonging to them in the Marwari Brothers ........ and to all dividends and profits in respect thereof with effectfrom 1-2-1941........ \" 2. \"And it is further ordered and decreed that against payment or tender by the plaintiffs to the said defendants ........ of the said sum of Rs. 2,45,000 with interest as aforesaid the said defendants-appel\u00ad lants and all proper parties do execute in favour of the plaintiffs proper deed or deeds of transfer or assignment of the said 250 shares in the Ganga Devi Sugar Mills Limited and the saidfive annas share in the Marwari Brothers ........ \" This was in slight variation of the first Court's decree. The exact variation does not matter. All ' - ._, - \u2022 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 65 that it is necessary to note is that the plaintiffs (that 1956 is, the Padrauna Group) tendered the moneysome time after the first Court's decree and before the Jai N;,:,7~7aRam Calcutta High Court's decree. The tender was not v. accepted as the defendants (the Bettia Group) had KedarNath appealed. It is admitted that there was no second Khetan and others tender after the High Court's decree.- After the Federal Court had settled the matter, Bose J. one of the defendants, J ainarain Ram Lundia, applied to the Calcutta High Court for execution. The deotee was transferred to the Subordinate Judge, Motihari, and the executionproceedings started there on 25-1-1951. One of the plaintiffs, Kedarnath Khetan, filed an objection petition on 20-3-1951. That is the objection we are concernedwith. Among other things, one of the objectionswas that the de- fendants were not in a position to implement the conditions imposedon them by the decree because the Marwari Brothers firm was dissolved by agree- ment between the parties before the Federal Court's decree and was no longer in existence. The present appeal turns almost entirely on that fact and on the consequences that flowfrom it. The first Court, that is, the Subordinate Judge's Court at Motihari to whom the decree had been transferred, declined to go into this holding that it had no jurisdiction as a transferee Court. The plaintiff Kedarnath appealed to the High Court and succeeded. The High Court held that the transferee Court had jurisdiction, that the Marwari Brothers had beendissolved and that because of that the defendants could not execute the decree. The defendants appealedhere. Wewillfirstconsider the question of fact,namely, whether the Marwari Brothers was stillin existence as a firm at the date of the executionapplication. On this point we agree with the High Court that it was not, for the following reasons. The plaintiff Kedarnath asserted in hisobjection petition that the firm had beendissolved by agree\u00ad ment between the parties \"including the plaintiffs and the defendants\". This fact was not denied by 9 1956 J ai Narain Ram Lundi a v. KedarNath Khetan and others Bose}. 66 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] the defendant Jainarain Ram Lundia in his rejoinder though the fact was specificallyalleged to be within his personal knowledge. Even if he did not know whether the firm had beendissolved or not (a fact which cannot be the case for reasons that we shall givelater) he was certainly in a position to admit or deny whether the fact was within his personal know\u00ad ledge. His silence can therefore only have one mean- ing. \u00b7 The defendant's learnedcounsel contended before us that the fact had beendenied by implication be\u00ad cause Kedarnath stated that his sidewas, and had always been, ready to perform their part of the de\u00ad cree. Counsel argued that as the plaintiffs contended that performance was not possible after the dissolu\u00ad tion of the M.arwari Brothers firm this meant that the firm was still in existence.We reject this con\u00ad tention and remark in passing that this is inconsistent with another argument whichwas alsourged in this Court, namely that the fact of dissolutionwas no bar to performance on the defendant's part. Quite apart from the language of the rejoinder, the defendant Jainarain said in paragraph 15 of his ap\u00ad plication dated 12-7-1954 made to the High Court for leave to appeal here that \"the said Marwari Brothers was in existence on the date of the said conveyance, namely 14th September 1950, and dieda naturaldeath on the con\u00ad veyance of the Ganga Devi Sugar Mills. to North Bihar Sugar Mills\". This is a clear admission that the firm was dissolved, at any rate,on 14-9-1950. The plaintiff's contention is that it wasdissolved much earlier but whether that wasso or not will make no difference to this appeal because14-9-1950is alsobefore the date of the ap\u00ad plication for execution. The defendant's learned counsel tried to explain this away also. He said that the defendant did not mean that the firmwas dissolved on that date but that as the only purposefor which the firm existed, namely, the managing agency of the Ganga Devi Sugar Mills, had gone the firmcouldno longer func\u00ad tion. ' - ) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 67 In .order to understand this, some further facts will 1 956 benecessary.While the plaintiff's appeal was being Jai Narain Ram heard in the High Court, the defendants made an Lundia application to that Court on 14-4-1954asking for v. permission to adduce further evidence in the shape of Kedar Nath a saledeed dated 14-9-1950. The defendant con- Khetan and others tended that he had only \"recently\" come to know that the GangaDevi Sugar Mills had sold all its land, machinery, etc. to the North Bihar Sugar Mills on 14-9-1950. This terminated the managing agency, and as the only business of the firmwas this managing agency and as that was the only purposefor which the firmwas formed, it was no longerable to func- tion. But he said that this deedwouldshow con- clusively that the firmwas in existenceon that date. The High Court refused to accept this document be- cause it considered that the only ground on which additional evidencecan be admitted in appeal is when the Court is unable to pronounce judgment on the material already beforeit; as that was not the case here it rejected the document. Weneed not decide whether there is any conflict of viewbetween the Privy Council decisions in Kessowji Issur v. G.I.P. Rly.(1) and Parsotim v. Lal Mohar(g) on the one hand and Indrajit Pratap Sahi v. Amar Singh( 3 ) on the other because,even if this evidence were to be admitted and were to be accepted as true, there wouldstill be the defendant's admis\u00ad sionin the High Court that the firm stooddissolved at least on 14-9-1950.We are not able to construe the statement in any other way. The plaintiff says that the dissolutionwas much earlier and that the firm mentioned in the sale deednow sought to be filed was not the samefirm but another firm of the same name, but even ifthe defendant's versionbe accepted the fact still remains that evenaccording to his statement there was a dissolutionbefore his applica\u00ad tion for execution and that therefore the defendants were not in a position to assign their five annas share (1) [1907] L.R. 84 I.A. 115, 122. (2) [1981] L.R. 58 I.A. 254. (3) [1928] L.R. 50 I.A. 183, 190, 191. Bose]. 68 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 in the Marwari Brothers firm. We now have to con\u00ad sider the effect of that. Jai Narain Ram Lunaia Much of the argument about this revolved round v. the question whether the equitable rules that obtain Kedar Nath before decree in a suit for specific performance con\u00ad Kheta\" and others tinue at the stage of execution. It is not necessary - for us to go into that herebecause the position in the Bose]. present case is much simpler. When a decree imposes obligations on both sides which are so conditioned that performance by one is conditional on perform\u00ad ance bv the other execution will not be ordered un\u00ad less the\u00b7 party seeking execution not onlyoffers to perform his side but, when objection is raised, satis\u00ad fies the executing Court that he is in a position to do so. Any other rule would have the effect of varying the conditions of the decree:a thing that an execut\u00ad ing Court cannot do. There may of course be decrees where the obligations imposed on each side are distinct and severable and in such a case each party might well be left to its own execution. But when the obligations are reciprocal and are interlinked so that they cannot be separated, any attempt to en\u00ad force performance unilaterally would be to defeat the directions in the decree and to go behind them which, of course, an executing Court cannot do. The only question therefore is whether the decree in the present case is of this nature. We are clear that it is. The relevant part of the decree has already been quoted. It directs that \"against payment or tender by the plaintiffs .... the said defendants ... do execute in favour of the plaintiffs proper deed or deeds of transfer of ....five annas share in the Marwari Brothers .... \" This is not a case of two independent and severable directions in the same decree but of one set of reci\u00ad procal conditions indissolubly linked together so that they cannot exist without each other. The fact that it is adecreefor specific performance where the decree itself cannot be given unless the side seeking per\u00ad formance is ready and willing to perform his side of the bargain and is in a position to do Bo, only strengthens the conclusion that that was the meaning \u2022 I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 69 and intendment of the language used. But the 1996 Principle on whichwe are foundingis not confined to J ai Narain Ram cases of specific performance. It will apply whenever Lundia a decreeis soconditioned that the right of one party v. to seekperformancefrom the other is conditional on Kedar Nath his readiness and ability to perform hisownobliga- Khetan and others tions. The reasonis, as we have explained, that to hold otherwise would be to permit an executing Court to go behind the decree and vary its terms by split- ting up what was fashioned as an indivisible whole into distinct and divisible parts having separate and severableexistence without any interrelation between them just as if they had been separate decrees in separate and distinct suits. Fry on SpecificPerformancewas quoted to us (6th edition, Chapter IV, pages546 onwards)where the learned author states that relief can often be obtained after judgment along much the same lines as before: thus a party to a contract may, in a proper case, apply for rescission of the contract and so forth. It wasurged by the other side that even if that can be done it can onlybe done by the Court whichpassed the decree and not in execution.We do not intend to examine this becauseeven if these remedies also exist,provided application is made to the proper Court, it does not affect the basic principle in execu\u00ad tion that the executing Court must take the decreeas it stands and cannot go behind it. If the decree says that on payment being made somedefinite and specific thing is to be given to the other side, the executing Court cannot alter that and allowsomethingelse to be substituted for the thing ordered to be given. The learned counselfor the defendant-appellant contended that even if the Marwari Brothers had ceased to exist as a firm the plaintiff wasstill entitled to a five annas sharein its assetson dissolu\u00ad tion. But afive annas share in the assets of a dis\u00ad solvedfirm which has ceased to exist is a very diff\u00ad erent thing froma five annas share ina going part\u00ad nership concern; and to permit this substitution in the decreewould be to alter it in a very material particular. The defendant may or may not have the Bose}. 1956 J ai Narain Ram Lundia v. KedarNath /(hetan and others Bose J. 70 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] right to ask the Court which passed the decree to vary it in that way but he can certainly not ask the executing Court to do so. The .decree must either be executed as it stands in one of the ways allowed by law or not at all. In the High Court, and also beforeus, much was made of the fact that the plaintiff had not re-ten\u00ad dered the money after the decree was varied by the High 8ourt and it was argued that that preclnded him from contesting the defendant's right to attach his property under Order XXI, rule 32(1), of the Civil Procedure Code. The remedy provided in Order XXI, rule 32(1),is, of course,one of the remedies available in execution of a decreefor specific per\u00ad formance but it can only be used by a person who is entitled to execute the decree, and if, by reason of his own incapacity to perform his part, he is pre\u00ad cluded from seeking execution, Order XXI, rule 32(1), cannot apply. The only question that remains is whether the executing Court can consider whether the defendant is in a position to perform his part of the decree. But of course it can. If the executing Court cannot con\u00ad sider this question whocan? The executing Court has to see that the defendant gives the plaintiff the very thing that the decree directs and not something else,so if there is any dispute about its identity or substance nobody but the Court executing the decree can determine it. It is a matter distinctly relating to the execution, discharge and satisfaction of the decree and so under section 4 7 of the Ci vii Procedure Code, it canonlybe determined by the Court executing the decree. And as for the first Court's conclusion that it could not decide these matters because it was not the Court that passed the decree, it is enough to say, as the High Court did, that section 42 of the Code expressly gives the Court executing a decree sent to it the same powers in executing such decree as if it had been passed by itself. The next point urged by the appellant was that as the plaintiff did not raise the present objection before the Federal Court when it passed its decree he -, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 71 is precludedfrom doingso now. It is true this would 1956 have beena good ground forresistinga decreefor Jai Narain Ram specific performance but is no answer to the objection Lundia to execution. The defendant undertook to perform v. his part when the decree was passed and he must KedarNath makegood that undertaking beforehe can seek execu- Khetan and others tion because the decree, in view of its language and intendment, must either be executed as a whole or not at all; it cannot be split up into different and un- correlated parts and be executed unilaterally. It may beobservedin passing that it was as much the duty of the defendant to seekmodification of the contract by the Court whichpassed the decree, or modification of the terms of the decree later if he did not know these facts at the time, as hesays, it was of the plaintiff. The fact remains that the decree waspassed in these terms and it must either be executed as it stands or not at all unless the Court whichpassed it alters or modifies it. Then it was argued that this objection to execution should have been taken by the plaintiff in the Cal\u00ad cutta High Court when the defendant asked for transfer of the decree to Motihari and that as that was not done it istoo late now. But herealso the answeris the same. The only question before the Calcutta High Court on the application made to it was whether the decree should be transferred or not. Whether the plaintiff might or could have taken the objection in the High Court is beside the point be\u00ad cause it is evident that heneed not have doneso on the only issuewhich the application for transfer raised,namely, whether the decreeshould be trans\u00ad ferred or not; at best it could only be said that the plaintiff had a choice of twoforums. If the appellant's contention is pushed to its logicalconclusion it would mean that whenevera decreeis transferred all objec\u00ad tion to execution must ceaseunless the order of the Court directing the transfer expresslyenumerates the issues that the transferring Court is at liberty to deter\u00ad mine. In our opinion section 42 of the Civil Proce\u00ad dure Code is a complete answer to this contention. The appeal fails and isdismissed with costs. BoseJ."

The Judgment of the Court wasdelivered by DAS C.J.-This is an appealfrom the judgment and decreepassed on the 28th September, 1953, by a Bench of the Orissa High Court in an Original Suit whichwas filed on the 24thNovember,1952, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Cuttack and was on the 17th January, 1953, transferred to the High Court and marked as Original Suit No.1 of 1953. The suit wasfiledby the plaintiff-appellantclaiming as the Raja and owner of the Rajgee, known as the Kanika Raj, against the State of Orissa, praying for adeclaration that the Orissa Estates AbolitionAct, 1951 (hereinafterreferred to as \"the Abolition Act\") was, in its application to the Rajgee of Kanika, in\u00ad valid, unconstitutional and ultra vires the State Legis- \"' lature and for an injunction restraining the State of - Orissa from taking any action under the said Act. The suit was instituted evidently under an apprehen\u00ad sion that the State of Orissa might issuea notifica\u00ad tion undersection3(1) of the AbolitionAct declaring that the Rajgee of Kanika had passed to and become vested in the State freefromall encumbrances. The High Court dismissed the suit hut gavea certificate offitnessfor appealto this court. Hence the present appealby theplaintiff. Theplaintiff'scontentionbefore us is that no notificationunder section3(1) of the Abolition Act 10 74 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 7956 .can issuebecause (1) his land is not an \"estate\" as . -. -. defined in section2(g) of the Act, and (2) the plain- Ra1a Sri Sa1lendra t\"ff\u00b7 t w t d\" ' \u00b7 h \u00b7 h \u00b7 f Nara:;anBhanja I IS no an m erme1ary wit mte meanmg o Dco section2(h) thereof. In answer to this, the Attorney- v. General, appearing on behalf of the State, makesfive The State of Orissa\u00b7 submissions,viz., Das C.J. (a) that on the admitted facts the plaintiff's land is an \"estate\" within the meaning of the Abolition Act;(b) that the plaintiff is estopped by the compro\u00ad misedecreepassed by the Patna High Court on 2nd May 1945 in F.A. No. 15 of 1941 from contending that his land is not an \"estate\" within the meaning of the AbolitionAct; (c) that the plaintiff's land has been held as an \"estate\" ever since 1803; (d) that whatever may have been the position before 1805, the plaintiff's land became an \"estate\" by Regulation XII of 1805; and (e) that in any event, the plaintiff's land became an \"estate\" after 1805 by subsequent acts and con\u00ad duct of the plaintiff and his predecessorsin title. Re. (a):-Under section 3(1) of the Abolition Act, the State Government can declare that a specified \"estate\" has passed to and has become vested in the State. It is,therefore,clear that the State Govern\u00ad ment cannot make amy notification with respect to land which is not an \"estate\". \"Estate\" is defined in section2(g) of the AbolitionAct. The material portion of that definition, as it stood at the date of the institution of the suit, was as follows:- \" 'estate' means any land held by an inter\u00ad mediary and included under one entry in any of the generalregisters of revenue-payinglands and revenue, free lands, prepared and maintained under the law for the time being in force by the Collector of a dis- trict, ........................ \" In order to be an \"estate\", the land must be held by an \"intermediary\" and must be included under one en try in any of the generalregisters of revenue-pay\u00ad ing lands and revenue-free lands and such general registers must be prepared and maintained under the - - - I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 75 law for the time being in force. Section 2(h), as it 195 6. stood then, by its earlier part, defined an \"interme- R . s;.--s \u00b7zendra d\u2022 \"\u2022 h ~ \" tt \" t a1a' a\u2022 iary , wit re1erence to any es ae,omean, Narayan Bhanja amongst other things, a proprietor. The plaintiff Deo certainly claims to be the proprietor of his land. v.. Therefore if his land is an \"estate\" he is clearly an The State ofOrissa '' \"intermediary\". The case of Biswambhar Singh v. - The State of Orissa and Others(1), which has beenrelied Das C.J. on by learned counselfor the plaintiff has no appli- cation to the present case,for that case was concerned not with the earlier but with the latter part of the definition of \"intermediary\". That the plaintiff's land is includedunder one entry in the generalregister of revenue paying lands is not disputed. What is contendedfor is that in order to make such land an \"estate\" the register must be prepared and main- tained under the lawfor the time being in force. There is no dispute that \"the law for the time being, in force\" means the Bengal Land Registration Act (BengalAct VII of 1876). The plaintiff contends that the register in which his land is included under one entry was not prepared or maintained under the Bengal Land Registration Act. The argument is that it is not onlynecessary to show that the land is included under one entry ina register but that it is alsonecessary to show that the registerwhere the entry appears was prepared and maintained under the law. Under the Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876, land can be included in the register prepared and maintained under that Actonly if such land is an \"estate\" as defined in that Act. The relevant part of that definition i.s:- \"3(2) 'estate' includes:- ( a) any land subject to the payment of land\u00ad revenue, either immediately or prospectively, for the discharge of whicha separate engagement has been entered into with Government; (b) ........................................................ (c) ............................................................ \" It is urged,therefore, that the preparation of a register unrler that Actmeans the making of entries in that (1) [1954J s.c.R. s42, 76 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 register of lands which are subject to the payment of - land revenue for the discharge of which a separate Raja Sri Sailcndra hbd.L.. Narayan Bhanja eng~gement as een entere mto. and which is not Deo subject to payment of land revenue and for the dis- v. charge of which a separate engagement has not been The State o/Orissa entered into is not an \"estate\" and cannot be entered Das C.J. in the register prepared and maintained under the Bengal Land Registration Act. That Act confers powers on the Collector to prepare the register in the manner specified therein and such statutory power; in order to have effect, must be exercised in strict compliance with the provisions of that Act. The plaintiff maintains that the Rajgee of Kanika was never subject to payment of land revenue for the discharge of which a separate engagement had been entered into by him or his predecessors-in\u00ad title. That the ancestors of the plaintiff were at one time independent chiefs and that the Rajgee or Killa of Kanika was in ancient time an independent State are conceded. Later on, the Rajas of Kanika owed nominal allegiance to the Mahrattas. Then came the last Mahratta War and the plains of Orissa were con\u00ad quered by the East India Company. On 22nd November, 1803, there was an \"Engagement\" bet\u00ad ween the East India Company and Raja Balabhadra Bhanja Deo, the then Raja of Killa Kanika. The East India Company on the same day granted a Kaool-Namah to the Raja. Under the Engagement the Raja agreed, amongst other things, to pay, as annual Peshkush or tribute, 84,840 Kahuns ofCowrees, amounting to Rs. 20,407-12-11. This Engagement was confirmed by clause 10 of the Treaty of Peace concluded on the 17th December, 1803, at Deogan between the East India Company and the Mahrat.tas which treaty was later on ratified by the Governor\u00ad General in 1804.On the 5th September, 1805, was passed the Bengal Regulation XII of 1805. Sections 33 to 37 which are material for our present purpose were as follows:- \"XXXIII.-The Commissioners having granted sanads to certain zamindars, entitling them to hold \u2022 S.C.R.

It isclaimed that there was at no subsequent time any suchrevenue settlement as was contemplated by \u2022 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 79 section XXXV(3) and that there was no separate 1956 engagementfor payment of any land revenue at any . -. - . time thereafter. The conclusion sought to be drawn ~Ja ~~:';;!\"::;: in the circumstancesis that as Killa Kanika was not ara Deo subject to payment of land revenue, for the discharge v. of which a separate engagement had been entered The Stateof Orissa into, it was not an \"estate\" as defined in Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876, and that that being the posi\u00ad tion, it could not have been validly entered in the register prepared and maintained under the Bengal Land . Registration Act. The action of the Collector in entering Killa Kanika as a revenue-paying estate waswholly ultravires and in the eye of the law such an entry is a nullity and does not exist. It follows, therefore, that Killa Kanika cannot be regarded as an \"estate\" within the meaning of the Abolition Act because the generalregister in which it is included cannot be said to have beenvalidly prepared and maintained under the law for the time being in force. Section 4 of the Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876,directs the Collector of every district to prepare and keep up the four kinds of registers therein men\u00ad tioned. Section 7 lays down that in Part I of the generalregister of revenue-paying lands should be entered the name of every estate which is borneon the revenue-roll of the district and certain other particulars relating to every such estate as therein specified.Therefore, if the name of Killa Kanika was borneon the revenue-roll of the district, the Collector wouldbe bound to enter the same in Part I of the generalregister prepared and kept up by him under section 4. Section 20 of the Act provides that until the registers by that Act directed to be prepared were so prepared the existingregisters then kept up in the office of every Collectorshould be deemed to be the registers kept up under the Bengal Land Registra\u00ad tion Act,1876. Prior to 1876, land registersused to be maintained under the Bengal Regulation XLVIII of 1793 as amended by Bengal Regulation VII of 1800. Existing registers mentioned in section 20 of the Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876,clearlyrefer to registers kept under those Regulations and the learned , Das C.J. 80 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956) 1956 Attorney-General contends that section 20 gives a R . 8-. -. statutory validity to the registers kept under those a1a \"SatlendraR I \u00b7 M p RD \u00b7 f h J Narayan Bhanja egu atlons. r. .. as appearmg or te appe - Deo !ant submits that his arguments apply with equal v. force to the registers kept under the old Regulations TheState of Orissa referred to above.According to him, if the Collector Das C.J. entered lands which were not \"estate\" as defined in the old Regulations,he did not exercise his statutory powers and the entry made by him was a nullity and if any of the existing registers was void as regards a particular entry, then that entry did not exist and could not be transferred to the new register and if it was transferred, such transfer was a nullity and the newregister, qua that entry, was void and could not be said to have been prepared and maintained under law. We are unable to accept the line of reasoning developed by Mr. P. R. Das.To accede to his con\u00ad tention wouldbe to add words to section2(g) of the Abolition Act so as to make it applicable to lands which were \"validly\" included under one entry in any of the generalregisters \"properly\" prepared and maintained under the law for the timebeing in force, that is to say, the Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876.This the court has no power to do. If section 2(g)defined \"estate\" as including lands mentioned in the schedule to the Act, then whatever was in\u00ad cluded in the 3chedulewould be an \"estate\" within the meaning of the AbolitionAct, irrespective of whether such land was or was not an \"estate\" within the meaning of any other Act. The same reasoning applieswhen the definitionincludes lands entered in -the general registers prepared and maintained under the Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876. Here the reference to the register prepared or kept under the law for the time being in force was meant only to identify the particular register in which the particular land was included under one entry. Suppose that a register prepared and maintained under the Bengal Land Registration Act, 1876,includedlands which were \"estates\" within the meaning of the Land Registration Act and also lands whichwere not S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 81 \"estates\" within the meaning of that Act. Suppose 1956 further that the Orissa Legislature by the Abolition. -. - . 4 A .dd \u2022 l' d 11 hldl . Raia Sn SadeH ,. \u2022. . ct mten e. to me u. ea t ~se an s, proper Y or Nara;yan Bhan/a improperly included m the register, what language Deo would they then have used? Precisely the language v. they have used in section2(g) of the AbolitionAct, The State ofOritis\u2022 namely, that an \"estate\" means any land included in D-~\u00b7J the generalregistersprepared and maintained under as \u00b7 \u2022 the law for the time beingin, force. In other words, the definitioncovers lands which are factuallyin- cluded in the particular registerreferredto. Whether they are \"estates\" within the meaning of the Bengal Land RegistrationAct, 1876, and whether they were validly or properlyentered according to the provi- sions of that Act,appears to us to be whollyirrele- vant for the purpose of construingsection 3(g) of the AbolitionAct. In our opinion, the contention of the State of Orissa on this point must be accepted. Re. (b):-Mr. P.R. Das appearingfor the appellant objects to the plea of estoppel being raised,because it has not been included in the Statement of Case filed in the presentappeal by the respondent. Order XVIII of the Rules of this Court deals with the lodg\u00ad ing of cases. Under Rule1 no party to an appealis entitled to be heard by the courtunlesshe has previouslylodged his casein the appeal.Rule 3 lays downhow the case is to be vrepared and what its contentsshould be. Order XIX, Rule 4 provides that the appellant shall not, without the leave of the Court, rely at the hearingon any grounds not speci\u00b7 fied in the Statement of-Case filed by him.The Privy Council Practicefounded on Shea Singh Rai v. Mu88U\u00b7 mut Dakhoand Moorari Lall(1) and set forth in Bent\u00ad wich 3rd editionRuling 63 at page 181 is to the same effect.There is no rule imposingcorresponding dis\u00ad ability on therespondent. Further evenwith regard to the appellant the Court may,in appropriate cases, givehim leaveto raisea ground not specified in the Statement of Case. In tlie present case there isno question of surprise,for the plea of estoppal was pointedlyraised and made the subject matter of an (1) [1878] L.R. 5 I.A. 87. 11 82 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956) 1956 issue before the High Court and was elaborately dealt R . 5-:--5 . d with bv the High Court in its Judgment under ap- ,a1a ri atlen ra l \u2022I h. d .. Nar\"\"\"\" Bl Judge stated as . fe!lows:- \"Now taking these two documents together, it is difficult to read in them that any grant was made either expressly or~mpliedly by the.sovereign autho\u00ad rity in favour of the holder of the Killa. The main provisions are that the revenuewas fixedfor ever, and that the holderwas asked to be loyal to the Company's Government. Thus initially,I have been unable to associate any idea of grant as to be flow\u00ad ing from these engagements.All that can be sairl, and perhaps the learnedcounselfor the plaintiff maintains to that effect, is that what rights the holder of the Killa had, in reference to the Killa, were fully and without any limitation or restrictioQ,recognised. It is, therefore, that the question willnowbe set at largefor a discussion as to what rights the proprietor of the Killa had at the time when these engagements were made,,. \u2022 It isneedless to extract further passagesfrom the judgment. In the result the learned Subordinate Judge answered the issues against the plaintiff and dismissed the \u00b7suit. The plaintiff appealed to the Patna High Court. A compromisewas arrived at between the parties, which was filedin court and the appeal was disposed of in accordance with the terms of the compromise petition'. The principal terms of the compromise petition wereas follows:- .J .. > - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 87 \"l.

The declaration that the plaintiff, as the proprietor of the Kanika estate, was. the rightful owner of fisheries in the saidrivers and that the defendant would not claim any assess\u00ad ment on that ground was nothing hut a recognition of ~he plaintiff's title a:s the holder of a permanently \u00b7 settled estate. The sameobservations apply to clause(3) whereby the plaintiff wasdeclaredto have the ferry rights over the said rivers,.which were ex\u00ad presslymade subjectto the rights of the State in the beds of the rivers.The provision\u00b7 that all future riparian accretionsor Chars formed adjoining the banks of the rivers wouldalwaysbe deemed part of the permanently settled Zemindari of Kanika and shouldbe possessed by him without further payment of assessment of land revenueover and above the land revenue that had been permanently fixed clearly acknowledges that the plaintiff accepted the position that he had no rights other than what he had as the holder of a permanently settled estate liable to the payment of land revenue, in contradistinction to ..

Narayan Bhanja .Mr. P. R.Dascontends that the issue in the pre- Deo sentcase is whether the land held by the plaintiff is v. an \"estate\" within the meaning of the Bengal Land The State of Orissa RegistrationAct, 1876,whereas the issue in the earlier casewas whether the plaintiff'spredecessors had title to the river beds by expressor implied grant from the Crown.This does not appear to us to be a fair readingof the pleadingsas a whole. The plaint in the earlier suit summarisedabove and the passages culledfrom the judgment of the trial court clearly indicate that the partieswent to trial on the definite and well understoodissue that the plaintiff's claim to the river beds was foundedon his anterior title as an independentRuling Chief of Killa Kanika and that that title hadbeenconfirmed by the Engagement and Kaoolnama of 1803, whichwere, in a looseway, con- struedas a grant of the riverbeds,express or implied, by the East India Company. What the partiesun- derstoodby the issues on which they went to trial is clearlyillustratedby the passages quoted from the judgment.The fact that the claim in the earlier suit related only to a part of theland, namely the river beds,whereas the presentcase is that the entire land held by\u00b7 the plaintiffis not an \"estate\" makes no difference,for the real issuebetween the parties in the earlier suit was, as it is in the present suit, only concerning his status and the rights fl.owing there- from.To hold in this suit that the plaintiffis not the holder of an estate subject to payment of land revenue for the discharge of which a separate engage~ ment has beenenteredinto, will be to permit the plaintiffto set up a sovereign status forhimself, whichhe actuallydid in the earlier case but failed to establish in the trial court and \u00b7which he, by the compromise~ exptesslyabandonedin the appeal court. In our judgment the compromisedecree precludes the plaintifffrom re-asserting the title,which had been negatived by the compromisedecree although it re- lated only to his claim to a part of the lands,namely Das C.J. 90 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 the beds of the rivers therein mentioned. R \u2022 s~s .1 d The compromisedecree is also sought to be pleaded a1a \" ai en ra b th St t \u00b7 h 1 ''ff 1 b Narayan Bhanfa Y eae agamst tep amt! asestoppey Deo representation. It is said, that even if the compro- v. mise had not the imprimatur of the court, it would, TheState o/Orissa nevertheless,be representation that the plaintiff's - 1 predecessorwas the Zeminda'r of a permanently Das c. \u00b7 settled estate. The compromise consisted of recipro\u00ad calconcessions,those made by one party being the considerationfor those made by the other. It was on the basis of the concelilsion made by the plaintiff's predecessor, namely, that he was a Zemindar of a permanently settled estate, that the State gave up the benefit of the decreewhich had been passed in its favour by the trial court and also the right to levy assessment on the accretions of future Chars. One of the main considerationsfor the compromise was the clearadmission on the part of the plaintiff in that case that his status in respect of Killa Kanika was nothing more than that of a proprietor of a per\u00ad manently settled estate liable to pay land revenue. The High Court decided the issue of estoppel against the State on two considerations,namely, (I) that the status of the owner of Killa Kanika was not directly and substantially in issuein the earlier litigation and (2) that there was no clearevidenceled on the side of the State to establish that the admission \u00b7by the plaintiff in that case of his status was the main con\u00ad sideration for the compromise.We are satisfied that the High Court was in err():r on both these points. As already pointed out, the pleadings summarised above and the passages in the judgments quoted above clearly indicate that the status of the plaintiff was the foundation of his claim to the river beds and was consequently directly and substantially in issue in that litigation and was understood to be so by the p~rties themselves. On the second ground the terms of the compromise speak forthemselves. It is quite clear that the concessions made by one party were the consideration for those made by the other party and, therefore, it was not necessary to adduce any further evidence,assuming that any evidence was - S.C.R.

Nur-ud-dinAhmad and Naunit Lal, for the appel\u00ad lant. 0. K. Daphtary, Solicitoi\u00b7-General of India, G. N. Joshi and R.H. Dhebar, for the respondent. 1956. February 8. The Judgment of the Court wasdelivered by BHAGWATI J.-This is an appeal with special leavefrom the Judgment and Order of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur on a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay Branch 'A' under section66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act XI of 1922 whereby the High Court answered the ref\u00ad erred question against the appellant . . The appellant, a firm of Messrs Pratapmal Laxmi\u00ad chand of Betul consisted of 7 partners, viz.,Misrilal Goti,MeghrajGoti, Panraj Goti, Phulchand, Basanti\" bai, Ratanbai and GokulchandGoti. A deed of partnership wasexecuted on the 12th February 1944 by all the partners except GokulchandGoti who happened to be in the Seoni Jail beinga security prisoner under the Defence of India Rules. He was unable to sign the same in spite of all efforts to ob\u00ad tain his signature in prison.An application for registration of the firm under section 26-A of the Act for the assessment year 1943-44was made on the 24th March 1944 personally signed by the other 6 partners of the firm and was accompanied by the deed of partnership which also had been signed by those6 partners. The Special Income-tax Officer, Nagpur, rejected the application on the ground that the deed itself was not valid inasmuch as it had not beensigned S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 93 by all the partners mentioned in the body and there .195/i was no signature of Gokulchand on the deed and the Messrs Pratajmlal application. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Lu.miichand Assistant Commissioner against this decision of the v. Special Income-tax Officeron the 24th April 1944. Commissionerof Gokulchand appended his signature to the deed of Income-tax, partnership in Seoni Jail on the 9th January 1945. MadhyaPradesh The appeal was heard before the Appellate Assistant BhagwatiJ. Commissioneron the 20th March 1947 and he passed an order on the 17th February 1948 cancelling the order of the Special Income-tax Officer and directing him to register the firm after obtaining the signature of Gokulchand both on the application for registra- tion and the deed of partnership. At the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax, C. P. and Berar, an appeal wasfiled against this order of the Appel- late Assistant Commissioner by the Income-tax Officer, Spl. I.T. cum E.P.T. Circle, Nagpur,before the Income-tax AppellateTribunal. The Tribunal allowed the appeal by its order dated 11/16 October 1948observing that the Special Income-tax Officer wasjustified in refusing to register the firmas the application for registration was not signed by Gokul- chand, that Rule 2( c) of the Indian Income-tax Rules, 1922, on which the Appellate Assistant Commissioner seems to have relied did not apply and the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwas not justified in directing the Income-tax Officer \"to, register the firm after obtaining the signature of Seth Gokulchand both in the application for registration and the deed of part- nership\". The appellant applied for a reference to the High Court under section66(1) of the Act and the Tribunal referred the followingquestion arising out of its order for the opinion of the High Court: \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwas legally competent to direct the Income-tax Officer to register the firm after obtaining the signature of Seth Gokulchand both in the application for registration and in the deed of partnership\". When the statement of the casewasbeing drawn up by the Tribunal, counselfor the appellant suggested that the words 1956 Meara Prata/lfnal Llumlchrm4 v. Commlaslonerof lncottM-lax, Madhya Pradesh BhagwatiJ. 94 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) appearing in para 6 of the statement, viz., \"No appli\u00ad cation wassubmitted to the AppellateAssistant Commissionerseeking his permissionunder Rule 2(c) of the Indian Income-tax Rules\" be deleted. He also suggested that the concludingwords in the question referred to the High Court, viz., \"after obtaining the signature of Seth Gokulchand both in the application forregistration and in the deed of partnership\" be deleted. With regard to the latter suggestion the Tribunalobserved that they were unable to delete the sameinasmuchas the words sought to be deleted were the concludingwords appearing in the Appel\u00ad late AssistantCommissioner'sorder dated the 17th February, 1948 givingdirections to the Income-tax Officer and were wordswhichwere material to the questionbefore the High Court. With regard to the first suggestioncounsel for the appellant had stated that the appellant had submitted three applications to the AppellateAssistantCommissionerall dated 20th March, 1947 and that it would be wrong to state that no applicationwas submitted to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.The allegationmade by the appellant was properlyinvestigatedsubsequently and the Tribunal was satisfied that the \u00b7appellant did not appear to have put in the application dated 20th March,1947 as alleged.This .being the posi\u00ad tion the Tribunal stated that no changein the statement of case was calledfor as suggested by the appellant. It was on this statement of caseby the Tribunal that the referredquestion ca.me to be determined by the High Court. Before the High Court the appellant had appliedon the 27th November, 1950 that the threecertifiedcopies of the three applications dated 20th March, 1947 madeby the appellant to the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwith their originals shouldbe sent for by the High Court from the Income\u00ad . tax Tribunaland an orderhad beenmadeaccordingly. The High Court was of the opinion that the Appel\u00ad late Assistant Commissionershould have ordered registration of the firmprovidedthere was an appli\u00ad cationbefore him dulysignedby all the partners.As, I S.C.R.

The v. High Court accordinglyanswered the referred ques- Commiuioner of tion in the negative. Income-tax, An applicationunder section66-A(2) of the Act for MadhyaPradesh a certificatefor leave to appeal to this Court against BhagwatiJ. that orderwas dismissed by the High Court but the appellantobtained special leave to appeal against the same from this Court on the 6th December,1954. Themainquestion that arisesfor our determi\u00ad nation in this appeal is:-What are the powers of the AppellateAssistant Commissioneron the hear\u00ad ingof an appealagainst the refusal by the In\u00ad come-tax Officer to registera firmundersection 26-A of the Act and Rule 2 of the, Indian Income\u00ad tax Rules, 1922? Section 26-A of the Act provides:-\u00b7 \"(l) Applicationmay be made to the Income-tax Officer on behalf of any firm,constitutedunder an instrument of partnership specifying the individual shares of the partners,for registrationfor the pur\u00ad poses of thisAct and of any otherenactmentfor the time beingin forcerelating to income-taxor super\u00ad tax. (2) Theapplicationshall be made bysuch per\u00ad sonor persons, and at suchtimes and shall contain suchparticulars and shallbe in suchform, and be verified in suchmanner,as may beprescribed; and it shall be dealt with by the Income-tax Officer in such manneras maybe prescribed\". Rule2 of the Indian Income-taxRules, 1922, which was in force at the relevantperiod, in so far as is materialfor the purpose of this appeal, provided:- \" Anyfirm constituted underan Instrument of . Partnership specifying the individualshares of the partners may, under the provisions of section26-A of the Indian Income-taxAct,. 1922 register with the Income-tax Officer the particularscontained in the said Instrument on applicationmade in this behalf.

(e) ........................ \". The decision of the Income-tax Officer in regard to the invalidity of the deed of partnership inasmuch as it did not bear the signature of Gokulchand was not challenged by the appellant at any stage. of the proceedings nor in the statement of casebeforeus. Counsel for the 1appellant, however, relying on a pas\u00ad sage in the \"L~w and Practice of Income-tax by Kanga and Palkhivala'', 3rd Ed., at page 754, urged that it was not necessary that the partnership agree\u00ad ment should be signed by all the partners and if the agreement had not beensigned by one of the partners but that partner had assented to the agreement and put it forwardalong with the other partners for registration, the agreement would be admissible for registration. In the first instance, it was not open to the appellant to urge any point whichwas not taken in the statement of case and even if it was open to him to urge that contention we do not think it neces\u00ad sary to express any opiqion on the correctness or otherwise of the statement above referred to in view of the construction whichwe put on Rule 2 of the Indian Income-tax Rules, 1922. The Rules were framed under .section26-A(2) of the Act and had statutory force. Under Rule 2, the a,pplication for registration of the firm was to be made to the Income-tax Officer and the particulars contained in the Instrument of Partnership specify\u00ad ing the individual shares of the partners w.ere to be registered with him on an application made in that behalf signed by all the partners (not being minors) personally.No such application was submitted to the Special Income-tax Officer in this case beforehe - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 97 made his order on the 18th March 1944, and, on the 1956 materials as they stood on record then, the order of M -P ,, . Offi c l.'fi d essrs rataJ!mal the Special Income-tax cerwas periect y JUStl e. Luxmichana No such application signed by all the partners of the v. firmincludingGokulchandwas also availablebefore Commissioner of the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwhen he heard Income-tax, the appeal on the 20th March 194 7. The appellant Madhya Pradesh contended that he had in fact filed in the office of the Bhagu\u00b7ati J. Appellate Assistant Commissioner on the said 20th March1947 three applicationsone of which was such an application signed by all the partners personally includingGokulchand and it was strenuously urged on his behalf that the Appellate \u00b7AssistantCommis- sioner passedhis order dated the 17th February 1948 ignoring the saidapplicationwhich had been filed in his office. It wasurged that, if the AppellateAssist- ant Commissioner had before him the said applica- tion dated the 20th March 1947 signed by all the part- ners personallyincluding Gokulchand, it was his duty to direct a registration of the firmhimself without anything more inasmuch as the deed of partnership had beensigned by Gokulchandon the 9th January 1945 and the application for registration of the firm dated the 20th March 1947 bore his signature. The directiongiven by the Appellate Assistant Commis- sioner to the Income-tax Officer to register the firm was, it wascontended, therefore proper and we were asked to treat the words \"after obtaining the signa- ture of Seth Gokulchand in the application forregis- tration and in the deed of partnership\" as super- fluous. . We are not impressed .with this argument. Asap\u00ad pears abundantly clearfrom the terms of the order made by the Appellate Assistant Commissionerhim\u00ad self and also from the statement of case prepared by the Tribunal, the application signed by all the part\u00ad ners personally includingGokulchandwas not before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner.An applica\u00ad tion had beenmadeby the appellant before the Tri\u00ad bunal to amend the statement of case by deleting from para 6 thereof the words ''no application was submitted to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner 13 1956 'lrlessrs Pratap,,.,,z Luxtnial1and v. Co11\u20221t1issionet' o/ lncoine-tax, lvladl1ya Pradesh BhagwatiJ. 98 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] seekinghis permission under Rule 2(c) of the Indian Income-tax Rules\" but the same had beenrejected by the Tribunal as a result of proper investigation conducted by it subsequently, the Tribunal stating that they weresatisfied that the assesseedid not ap\u00ad pear to have put in an application dated the 20th March 1947 as alleged. The referencewas heard by the High Court on this statement of case prepared by the Tribunal and no stepswere taken by the ap\u00ad pellant before the High Court for having the state\u00ad ment of case amended by the Tribunal or for having a further statement of case submitted by the Tribunal recording therein the facts alleged by the appellant. We must, therefore,decide this appeal on the facts stated in the statement of case by the Tribunal and on thebasis that the application for registration dated the 20th March1947 signed by all the partners personallyincluding Gokulchandwas not before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. If that was the position, the only powerwhich the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had under Rule 2(c) was to accordpermission to the appellant to make the application in proper form to the Income\u00ad tax Officer signed by all the partners personally in\u00ad cludingGokulchandbefore the assessment was con\u00ad firmed, reduced, enhanced or annulled.The Appel\u00ad late Assistant Commissioner had, under the Rule, no power to direct the Income-tax Officer to register the firm after obtaining the signature of Gokulchand both in the application for registration and in the deed of partnership as he did.As a matter of fact the appel\u00ad lant did not ask forsuchpermission from the Appel\u00ad late Assistant Commissioner nor was any revision taken by the appellant before the Commissioner under section33-A of the Act against the said order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. The appellant contented himself with arguing that the order made by the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwas justified and the sole controversy whicharose between the parties and was the subject matter of ~he referred\u00b7 questionwas whether the Appellate. Assistant Com\u00ad missionerwas legally competent to direct the Income- S.C.R.

'!'hat attempt, however,failed and no steps BhagwatiJ. were tsken by the appellantbefore the High Court at the hearing of the reference to either have the referredquestionamended or reframed in order to bring into prominencehis contention in regard to the powers of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. On the questionas framed, the onlyanswerwhich the High Court could give was that the Appellate Assistant Commissionerwas not legally competent to direct the Income-taxOfficer to register the firm after obtaining the signature of Gokulchand both in the applicationfor registration and in the deed of part\u00ad nership. Rule 2(c) above-quoteddid not empower the Appellate Assistant Commissionerto do anything of the sort and we are of the opinion that the answer givenby the High Court in the negativewas, there\u00ad fore,correct. Counselfor the appellant tried to support his argu\u00ad ment by referring to the provisions of the earlier part\u00ad nershipdeeds between the several partners of this firm in the years 1929and1941which specifically pro\u00ad vided that in the event of retirement, or death of, or relinquishment, of his share by a partner; the part\u00ad nership will not be dissolved but willbe continued, in case of death of any of the partn.ers, by such of the partners as remained and the legalrepresentatives or nominees of the deceased partner and in the case of retirement of any of the partners by such of the part\u00ad ners as remained.We fail to understand what bear\u00ad ing theseclauseshave on the determination of the referredquestion. In the result, the appeal of the appellant fails and must stand dismissedwith costs."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.-These appeals are by a creditor of six employeesin the Tin Plate Co. of India Ltd. who had been adjudged insolvent@. The employees are members in a Provident Fund of the Tin Plate Co. and there were amounts standing to their credit in the said Fund. The creditor,Mukti Lal Agarwala,filed applications under section 4 of the Insolvency Act for orders that the amounts standing to the credit of the insolvents in the Provident Fund account were their properties and had vestedin the court and were available for distribution amongst the creditors. He sought a direction that the monies may be brought into Court. The petitions were directed primarily against the Tin Plate Co. Ltd. and the Trustees of the Provident Fund. They pleadedin answer that the amount standing to the credit of each insolvent in the Provi\u00ad dent Fund represented the contributions of the Com\u00ad pany and of the employees and that the corpus was a trust fund in the hands of the trustees of the fund; ~o they were not properties of the insolvents over which they had a disposingpower and that they were not debts due to the insolvents. It was said that ac\u00ad cording to the rulesgoverning the Provident Fund the moniesbecome payable to the employee or any other member of his familyonly on the happening of certain contingenciessuch as retirement, discharge, \u2022\u2022 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 103 dismissal or death and that till then no right accrued 1956 to the insolvent. It was further urged that the Muktt Lal trustees could not be removedfrom the custody and Agarwa!a control of the fund by the Official Receiver. v. The Insolvency Court, whichwas the court of the Trustees of the. District Judge at Purulia, heard the petitions and Pro1Ji~ent Fund 0f found on a construction of the rules of the Provident the[;n/'\":;d Co. Fund that the monies standing to the credit of A & C 0 0:~ :~hers. accountsin the name of each insolventwas his pro- perty overwhichhe had a disposingpower and hence Clrandrasekhara they were ava.ilablefor distribution among the credi- AiyarJ. tors under the InsolvencyAct. The trustees of the Fund and the Tin Plate Co. carried the matter on appeal to the High Court at Patna and they were successful. The learnedJudges (V. Ramaswami and Sarjoo Prasad, JJ.) held that under the rules governing the Fund the insolvents had no presentdisposingpower over the monies standing to their credit and that the Fund was really vested in the trustees. As the amount involved in the several petitions taken togetherwas overRs. 20,000, the High Court granted leave to the creditorsto appeal to this court. Thomaincontentionsurged by Mr. Isaacs on be\u00ad half of the appellantswere threein number:- ( a)Themonies standing to the credit of each insolventin the Provident Fund are his property, though payable at a future date and the question of present disposingpower arises only for bringingwith\u00ad in the scope of the definition what may not other\u00ad wisebe regardedas \"property\". (b) Though the .Provident Fund rulesspeak of a trust Fund and trustees, in reality,there was no transfer of ownershipby the employees in favour of the trustees and that there is no trust assuch. (c) In any event,even on the footing that a trust was createdover the Fund, the beneficial interest con\u00ad tinuesin the employees and this interest would vest in the Official Receiverfor the benefit of the creditors ininsolvency. Wehave to examine the soundness of thesecon\u00ad tentions. 104 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 The Provident Fund was started on the lst Jan- uary, 1929. The rules and regulations of this Fund Mukti Lal Agaro;ala are found in the deed of trust dated the 15th July, v. 1930, marked as Exhibit I. These rules, as amended Trustees of the from time to time in certain respects by supple\u00ad Pro\u2022id~ntFund.0/ mentary deeds, are given in the appendix to this the T\"' Plat\u2022 Co. judgment. oflnd1aLtd. 0 th k\" fdf d\" d\" .h andoJhers \u00b7 ne ma mg o an .or er oa JU icat1on, te whole of the property of the insolvent shall vest in Chandrasekhara the court or in aReceiver and shall becomedivisible Aiyar J. among the creditors.

The property of the insolvent for the purposes of vesting shall not include any property which is exempted by the Code of Civil Procedure, or by any other enactment for the time being in force from liability to attachment and sale in execution of a decree(section28(5)). Section 2(d) of the Act states:\" 'Property' includes any property over which or the profits of which any person has a disposingpower whichhe may exercisefor his own benefit\". A person has a disposingpower over pro\u00ad perty which he may exercisefor his ownbenefit, such as a power of appointment conferredon him under a will or a settlement, or the power of a Hindu father who is the manager of a joint Hindu family to sell the shares of his sons in the family property in dis\u00ad charge of their piousobligation to pay off his debts. In clause(b) of sub-section (2) of section 38 of the English Bankruptcy Act, 1914, this poweris specified in these words:- \"The capacity to exercise and to take proceed\u00ad ings forexercisingall suchpowers in or over or in res\u00ad pect of property as might have b\"een exercised by the bankrupt for his ownbenefit at the commencement of his bankruptcy or beforehis discharge,except the right of nomination to a vacant ecclesiastical bene\u00ad fice;\". All that we have to find out is whether the amounts standing to the credit of the severalsubscribers in the fund who have been adjudged insolvents are divi\u00ad sible among their creditors. If so, they would vest S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 105 in the court or the Official Receiver and would become 1956 availablefor distribution.

Underthe PunjabCourts Act of 1918 and the hierarchy of civil Courts establishedthereby, appeals from the Courts of the varioussubordinateJudges who constitutedistinct Courts do not ordinarilylie to the SeniorSubordinateJudge but to the\u00b7 District Judgeand the Court of the Additional Judgeis not a Court of co\u00ad ordinatejurisdictionwith that of theDistrictJudge. The Act neithermentionsnor recognises an AdditionalDistrict Judge as a Court of that hierarchy. Consequently,in a case whereoffencesunder ss. \u00b7193 and 471 of the IndianPenal Code were allegedto havebeen committedin a civilproceeding in the Court of a SubordinateJudge of the first class,exercising jurisdictionunder the Punjab CourtsAct of 1918, and neitherhe nor his successormade a complaintor rejectedthe applicationfor themaking of it, theSeniorSubordinateJudge had no jurisdiction to entertainthe matter and makethe complaint either as aCourt ofappealunder s. 476-Bor of its ownauthority unders .. 4 76-A of the Codeof Criminal ProceduTeand the Additional 17 1956 February 15 1956 l Singh v.

Theseprovisions have given rise to much conflict in the High Courts. The controversy has centred round the word \"ordinarily\". One class of case, of which Wadero AbdulRahman v. Sadhuram(') is a sample, holds that \"ordinarily\" means \"in the majority of cases\" and that it has noreference to the particular case in hand. We d-0 not think that is right because that givesno meaning to the proviso to sub-clause (3). If appeals lieto a particular Court, e.g., the Dis\u00ad trict Court, in the majority of cases and to another Court, say the High Court, only in a fewcases, then the inferior tribunal is afixed quantity and so the need to choosebetween the inferior and the superior Court cannot arise. That makessub-clause(a) to the proviso otiose; also, it does not necessarilyfollow that the appeal in the majority of cases will alwayslie to theinferior Court.Cases may occur in which the majority of appealswould go to the higher of two given tribunals; and in any case this interpretation has.the disadvantage that a Court may becompelled to callfor and go into a mass of statistics to ascertain which of two Courts entertains the majority of appeals over a givenperiod of time, as well as to determine what is the appropriate period of time. Another view considers that the wordmeans that the higher Court is the one to which there is an un\u00ad restricted right of appeal and so cannot apply when any restriction intervenes such as when the right of appeal is limited to a particular class of cases or is hedged in by conditions. This was the view taken in M. S. Sheriff v. Govindan(\"). Other views are alsopossible but we do not intend to explore them. In our opinion, the matter is to be viewed thus. The firstquestion to be asked is whether any decrees, orders or sentences of the original Court (1) (1930] 32 Cr. L.J. 1012. (2) A.I.I.1961Mod.1060,1061. \u2022 S.C.R. \u00b7SUPREME COURT REPORTS 131 are appealable at ail. If they are not, and the Court is a CivilCourt, then, undersection195(3), the appeal against the order making or refusing to makea com\u00ad plaint willbe to the principal Court of ordinary originalcivil jurisdiction. If, however,appeals from itsvariousdecrees and orders lie to different Courts, then we hive to see to which of them they \"ordinarily\" lie and\u00b7 select the one of .lowestgrade from among them. In determining the Court or Courts to which an appealwill ordinarilylie, we have to see which Court or Courts entertain appealsfrom that class of tribu\u00ad nal in the ordinaryway apart from specialnotifica\u00ad tionsor laws that lift the matter out of the general class. Our meaningwill be clearerwhen we turn to the case in hand and examine the Punjab Courts Act of 1918. Apart from the Courts of SmallCauses and Courts establishedunder other enactments, the Punjab Courts Act, 1918 makes provisionfor threeclasses of Civil Courts, namely- (1) the Court of the District Judge, (2) the Court of the Additional Judge, and (3) the Court of the Subordinate Judge. At the moment we are concerned with the Sub\u00ad ordinate Judge. Section 22 enables the State Govern\u00ad ment to fix the number of Subordinate Judges after consultation with the High Court. The local limit of jurisdiction of eachof theseJudgesis the district in which he is appointedunless the High Court defines adifferentlimit (section 27). The pecuniarylimits are set out insection 26: \"The jurisdiction to beexercised in civilsuitsas regards the valueby any personappointed to be a Subordinate Judgeshall be determined by the High Court eitherby including himin a class or otherwise as it thinks fit\". Theseare what mighthe termed the ordinarypowers and jurisdiction of these Courts. But sections 29 and 30 authorisethe High Court to confercertainaddi\u00ad tionalpowers and jurisdictionon them.We willdeal with that later. 19$6 K uldip Sing1' v. The Stat~ of Punjab and another Bose}. 1956 l{uldip Singh v. The State of Ptfnfab and another BoseJ. 0 132 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] Next, we turn to the provisions for appeal. They are governed by section39. In the absence of any other enactment for the time being in force, when the value of the suit does not exceed five thousand rupees the appeal lies to the District Judge, and in every other suit, to the High Court. But by sub-sec\u00ad tion (3) the High Court is empowered to direct by notification \"that appealslying to the District Court from all or any of the decrees or orders passed in an origi\u00ad nal suit By any Subordinate Judge shall be preferred to such other Subordinate Judge as may be men\u00ad tioned in the notification\" and when that is done \"such other Subordinate Judge shall bedeemed to be a District Court for the purposes of all appeals so preferred\". The High Court availed itself of this provision and provided that appealslying to the District Courts from decrees or orderspassed by any Subordinate Judge in two classes of case which are specified \"shall be preferred to the Senior Subordinate Judge of the first classexercisingjurisdiction within such Civil District\". There are thus three forums of appeal from the Court of the Subordinate Judge dependingon the _ nature of the suit and its value. The question is whether in each of these three classes of case the ap\u00ad peal can be said to lie \"ordinarily\" to one or other of these appellate tribunals. Applying the rule we have set out above, the appeal to the SeniorSubordi\u00ad nate Judge cannot be termed \"ordinary\" because the special appellate jurisdictionconferred by the Notifi\u00ad cation is not the ordinary jurisdiction of the Senior Subordinate Judge but an additional power which can only be exercisedin a certain limitedclass of case. It is not a powercommon to all Subordinate Judges nor even to all Senior Subordinate Judges. Therefore, it cannot be said that appealsfrom the Courts of the various Subordinate Judges \"ordinarily\" lie to the Senior Subordinate Judge. Consequently, that Court is not one of the appellate tribunals contemplated S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 133 by section 195(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code and its proviso. But appeals do \"ordinarily\" lie either to the District Court or the High Court; and as the. District Court is the lower of these two tribu\u00ad nals that must be regarded as the appellate authority for the purposes of section476-B of the Criminal ProcedureCode. Now it is to beobserved that vhis is a purely objec\u00ad tive analysis and is not subjective to any particular suit. In the present suit, the value of the suit was over Rs. 5,000, so the appeal would have lain to the High Court, but we are not concerned with that be\u00ad cause section 195(3)does not say that the appellate authority within the meaning of that sectionshall be the Court to which the appeal in the particular case under considerationwould ordinarilylie but generally \"the Court to which appeals ordinarily lie from the appealabledecrees or sentences of such former Court\". It would,however,be wrong to say that the nature of the proceedings in the case must be whollyignored becausesub-clause(h) to the proviso to sub-section (3) states that \"where appeals lie to a Civil and also to a Revenue Court, such Court shall be deemed to be subordinate to the Civil or Revenue Court according to the nature of the case or proceeding\". Therefore, to that limited extent the nature of the proceedings must be taken into account, but once the genus of the proceedingsis determined, namely whe\u00ad ther civil,criminal or revenue, the heirarchy of the superior Courts for these purposeswill be determined, first by the rules that apply in their specialcases and next by the rule in section 195(~) whichwe have just expounded and explained. M. S. Sheriff v. The State of Madras and Others( 1 ) was quoted but the present point was neither con\u00ad sidered nor decidedthere. The next questionis whether the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge is the same Court as Mr. Barlow's Court, namely the Court of the Subordinate (1 l [1954] S. C. R. 1144, 1147. 18 ' 1956 Kuldip Singh v. TheState of Punjab and another BoseJ, 1956 K uldip Singh T, The Stat. of Ptmjab an4 anolh~,. BoseJ. 134 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] Judge of the first class. That dependson whether there is onlyone Court of the Subordinate Judge in each district; presidedover by a number of Judges, or whether each Courtis a separate Court in its elf. That turns on the provisions of the Punjab Courts Act.We make it clear that our decisionon this point is confined to the Punjab Act.We understand that similarActs in otl:ier States are differentlyworded so that what we decidefor the Punjab may not hold goodelsewhere.We say this becauserulings were citedbeforeus from other parts of India which take differingviews.We do not intend to refer to them because it would not be right to examinethe language of Acts that are not directlybefore us. Accordingly, weconfineourselves to the Punjab Act (Act VI of 1918). Section 18 of the Punjab Courts Act states that there shall be the followingclasses of Courts, namely \" (3) the Court of the Subordinate Judge\". Section 22 provides that \"the State Government may ........ fix the number of Subordinate Judges to be appointed\". Section 26, which has already beenquoted,fixes the pecuniary limits of their jurisdiction. Then comes section 27 defining the local limits of their jurisdic\u00ad tion: \"(l) The locallimits of the jurisdiction of a Sub\u00ad ordinate Judge shall be such as the High Court may define. (2) When the High Court posts a Subordinate Judge to a district, the local limits of the district shall, in the absence of any direction to the contrary, be deemed to be the locallimits of his jurisdiction\". From there wego to the Notification. It is High Court NotificationNo. 4 dated 3-1-1923. It makes four classes of Subordinate Judges with effectfrom 5-1-1923 \"in respect of the jurisdiction to be exercisedby them in original snits, namely:- Class I-Subordinate Judges exercising juris- S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 135 diction without limit as to the value of the cases; Class II-Subordinate Judges exercisingjuris\u00ad diction in cases of which the value does not exceed Rs. 5,000;Class III-Subordinate Judges exermsmg jurisdiction in cases of which the value does not ex\u00ad ceedRs. 2,000; Class IV-Subordinate Judges exercisingjuris\u00ad diction in cases of which the value does not exceed Rs. 1,000. Whena Subordinate Judge is appointed to any of the classes constituted by this Notification,he shall exercise the jurisdiction hereinbefore defined for the class to whichhe is appointed within the local limits of the ci vii district to whichhe may be posted from time to time\". This gives rise to three points of view.According to one, there is onlyone Court of the Subordinate Judge for each district and every other Subordinate Judge is an additional Judge to that Court. Thisis based on the language of section18, and the High Court Notificationis, under that view, interpreted as dividing the Judges of that one Court into four ca\u00ad tegories but not as creating independent Courts.Sec\u00ad tion 26 is there read as empowering the High Court to include each Subordinate Judge individually on appointment into a givenclass within the one Court and not to turn him into a separate Court. According to the secondview, there are four classes of Subordinate Judge's Courts in t.he Punjab because of the High Court Notification. The argument here runs that section 18 must be read with section26, and as the High Court is empowered to divide Sub\u00ad ordinate Judges ina di11trict into classes it must mean that eachclassforms an independent Court,for, according to this point of view, it would be anomalous to have Judges of the one Court invested with differing pecuniary jurisdic tions because that is always regarded as inherent to the Court. The posi\u00ad tion created by the Act, it is said,is not the same as the one that ariseswhen work is administratively distributed among Additional Judges of the same 1956 Kuldij> Singh v. The State of Punjab and a not her BoseJ. 795G Kuldip Singh The State oj Punjab tmd a'fOllJer 136 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] Court because the jurisdiction and powers of the Judges are unaffected by such distribution and there remains the one Court with one inherent and terri\u00ad torial jurisdiction despite the distribution. The third viewis that each Subordinate Judge is a separate and independent Court in himself and it is pointed out that section27 'invests each Judge personally with a territorial jurisdiction and not the Oourt, and so alsosection26. Under section 33 the power of control (apart from the High Court) over all civil Courts within the local limits of a District Judge's jurisdictionis with him, and section 34 empowers the District Judge to distri\u00ad bute any civilbusiness \"cognizable by .... the Courts under his control. ... among such Courts in such manner as he thinks fit\". The Senior Subordinate Judge does not therefore appear to be vested with either administrative \u00b7or judicial control over any other Subordinate Judge ex\u00ad cept in so far as he is a Court of appeal in certain specifiedclasses of case. In our opinion, the Senior Subordinate Judge who made the complaint had no jurisdiction to make it, either as the original Court which tried the suit, or as the appellate authority under section476-B of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is not enough that he also had first classpowersbecausehe was not the same Court. That is not to say that a successor could not have been appointed to Mr. Barlow so as to establish continuity in the Court overwhich he presided. It is possible that onecould have been appointed and indeed it seems to have beenassumed that Mr. Augustinewas his successor. But as Mr. Augustine did not take up this matter we need not decide that point. What we think is clear is that Mr. Pitam Singh was not a successor,especially as appeals lay to him from certain decisions of the Sub\u00ad ordinate Judges in his district. It would be unusual to provide an appeal from one Judge of a Court to another single Judge of the same Court. It would be even more anomalous to have an appeal from the decision of a judgelie to his successorin office. Even - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 137 in the High Courts,where there are Letters Patent appeals, the appeal is always heard by a Division Bench of at least twoJudges; nor can this be treated as a casewherea Court with inherent jurisdiction decides the matter as an origina.1 tribunal though, owing to territorial or other similar classificittion not affecting inherent jurisdiction, the caseshould hav:e gone to some other tribunal of co-ordinateor lesser authority. Section 193(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code imposesa definite bar which cannot beignored or waived any more than the prohibitionsunder sec\u00ad tions 132 and 197 and, just as the sanctions provided for in those sections cannot begiven by any auth\u00ad ority save the onesspecified,so here,only the Courts mentioned in section195(1)(b) and (c) can remove the bar and make the complaint. Thisalso appears to accord with the Punjab prac\u00ad tice.

Thefirmmadeprofitsduringthe accounting yea1'S ending1943 and 1944 on whichit wasassessedto excessprofitstax respectivelyof Rs.10,023/5/-andRs.13,005/5/-.Duringtheyear 1944- 1945it \u7375\u7374\u610a\u6564 a lossof Rs.15,771and addingtheretoRs. 37,800 thestandardprofits for thebusiness,the Excess Profits Tax Officer determined the deficiency of profitsfor theyear at Rs.53,571.Acting under s. 7 of theExcess Profits Tax Act theExcess ProfitsTax Officer passed an orderon 23-12-1946whereby after settingoff the profitsof thefirmfor theyearsending1943 and 1944against the deficiencyof profitsduring the yearending1945, he directed a refundof Rs. 23,028/10/- whichhad beenpaid by the appellan~ as excessprofitstax for thoseyears. At the commencementof theassessmentyear 1944-1945there was a partitionin thejoint family of whichMohanLal was erst\u00ad whilekarta,he andhis twobrothersbecomingdivided in status. As a result thereofthe appellantfirm wasreconstitutedunder an agree\u00ad mentdated 17-10-1944, the partnersof thefirmbeingfive in num\u00ad ber.Therewas a reconstitutionof the firm withrespectto persons 1956 February 15 1956 Firm of Bhagat Ram MoT1anlat v. The Commissioner of Exctss Profits Tax, Madhya Pradesh, NagPur and, another 144 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] and their shares.According to s. 8(1) of the Excess Profits Tax Act the changein thepersonsis deemedto bringabout a disconti\u00b7 nuationof theold business and thecommencementof a. new one and if that sectionappliedno reliefcould have been grantedto the appellant under s. 7 of the Act. Thefactsas to the reconstitutionof the firm havingcome to the knowledgeof the Com'lissioner of ExcessProfitsTax be issued a notice under s. 20 of the ExcessProfits Tax Act callingupon the appellantwhy the order of Excess Profits Tax Officer dated 23-12-1946 should not be setasideon the ground of mistakeas he had failedto takeinto considerationthe changein the-constitution of the firmwhichtook placeon 17-10-1944. Afterhearing the ap\u00ad pellant the Commissionerheld by hisorderdated 15-3-1950 that on the facts disclosedthere was a changein the persons and that the a.ward of reliefunders. 7 of theActby the ExcessProfitsTax Officer was a mistake. He set aside order onlyso far as Bhagat Barn Mohan Lalwasconcernedmaintaining it with regard to twoothers. On an applicationfor a writ of certiorari and for a writof pro\u00b7 hibitionunder Art. 226 of the Constitution the High Court upheld the orderof the Commissioner. On an appea!'by SpecialLeave to the Supreme Court: Held (1) that by reason of the partition of the joint family and the reconstitution of thefirmunder the deeddated 17-10-1944 there was a changein thepersonscarrying on businesswithin s. 8(1) of the Act. If all the five personswho werementionedas partnersin the deed of 1944 werepartners of the old firm,therewouldbe nochange in the personscarryingon thebusinesswithin s. 8(1) of the Act by the mere fact of reshuffling of the sharesamong them but the real questionfor determinationwas whetherCbhotelaland Bansilal were partners in the firm constitutedon 23-8-1940. It is not in dispute that Mohanlal was the karta of the joint family, and that be entered into the partnershipon 23-8-1940 as suchkarta. rt is wellsettled that when the kart& of a joint Hindu family enters1nto a. partnershipwith strangers,the membersof thefamily do not ipso facto becomepartnersin that firm. They have no right to take part in itsmanagementor to suefor its dissolution.The creditorsof the firmwouldno doubtbe entitledto proceedagainst the joint family assetsincludingthe sharesof the nonppartner coparcenersfor reali .. sation of theirdebts. But that is becauseunder the Hindu Law, the karta bas the right whenproperlycarrying on business to pledge the creditof the joint familyto the extent of its assets,and not because the juniormembersbecome partnersin thebusiness.The liability ofthejuniormembersarises by reasonof theirstatusas coparceners and not byreasonof any contract of partnershipand it wouldfollow therefore that whenMobanlalbecame a partner of the firm on 23-8\u00b71940 Obhotelal and Bansilalcould not be held by reason of that fa.ct alone to have becomepartnerstherein. - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 145 Accordinglywhether the quer~ion was to be consideredon the 1956 principles of Hindu law or ontheprinciplesof theExcess Profits TaxAct therewas a changein thepersonnel of the firmon 17\u00b7 10\u00b7 1944 Firm of Bhagat and the matterfell withins. 8(1)of the Act. Ram Mohan/al (2) Thatthere was a mistakeapparenton therecordas required bys. 20 of the Act andtheCommissionerhad jurisdictionto pass theorderdated 15-3-1950 whichhe did.Therewas no forcein the contention that therecordin Excess Profits Taxproceedings con\u00b7 sistedin thepresentcase of theonlyorderdated23-12-1946and that the factson whichthe proceedingswere takenunder s. 20, namely,the constitution of the firmon 23-8-1940 and the changes effectedtherein on 17\u00b7 10\u00b7 1944 were not recitedthereinand that in consequencethere were no materialson which an ordercouldhave beenpassedunder that sectionbecause though the order of the Ex\u00b7 cessProfitsTax Officer dated 23-12\u00b7 1946 does not mentionthese factsthesefacts appearfrom the record of theincome-tax proceed\u00b7 ingswhichincludedthe registrationcertificate of the firmunders. 26-Aof theIncome-Tax Act andthe returnsmade by thefirm dis\u00b7 closingthe namesof thepartnersand theirrespectiveshares.

No. 9 of 1955. D. R. Prem, for the appellant. K. B. Asthana and 0. P. Lal, for the respondent. 1956. March 12.The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-Tbe appellant wassentenced to death for the murder of one Ram Dularey. He wasalso sentenced to seven years' rigorous imprisonment for having robbed the murdered man of bisgoods. He was tried along with two other persons,who were acquitted, by the Sessions Judge of Babraich. All the four assessors,who attended the trial, were of the opinion that the appellant was guilty. The High Court of Allahabadaffirmed the conviction and the sentence and this appeal is by special leave. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 193 Certain facts have been proved beyond all doubt. Indeed, the most important of them are admitted by the appellant in his statement under section342 of the Code of CriminalProcedurewhen examined in the Court of Sessions. It has beenestablished by the evidence in the case that the deceased Ram Dularey, a shop-keeper of J arwal, had gone to Lucknow to purchase goodsfor his shop. On his return journey, he got downfrom the train at Jarwal Road Station on the 2nd of July, 1954, at about 9-30 p.m. He had with him articlesconsisting of a box,a balti, a gunny bag, jholas and other things. Shortly thereafter, he engaged the appellant's cart to take him and his goods to hisvillage.Two other persons also got on to the cart. The appellant was driving the cart. Neither the deceased nor the articles,which were with him, nor the cart ever reached Jarwal. In the morning, Ram Dularey's bodywas found near a bridge inclose vicinity of Jarwal. Information was sent to the policewho commencedinvestigation and their enquiries led them to the appellant,who was arrested on the 6th of July, 1954.The appellant gave the key of his kothri to the policewith which it was opened. From the kothri numerousarticles were recovered, includinga bigknife Ex. 20 with blood-stains,a dhoti Ex. 3, a box Ex. 9,a balti Ex. 1,a chadar Ex. 2, a gunny bag Ex. 1:3 and a jhola Ex. 24. It is not ne\u00ad cessary to give the details of the other articles recovered. The knifewas sent to the Chemical Examiner alongwith the dhoti. Although minute blood-stainswere detectedon the knife, they were not sufficient to enable a comparison in a bloodgroup test. No bloodwas discover:ed on the dhoti. The dhoti Ex. 3, the box Ex. 9, the balti Ex. 1, the chadar Ex. 2, the gunny bag Ex. 13 and the jhola Ex. 24 have been identifiedas belonging to the deceased Ram Dularey. When examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the Sessions Judge, the appel\u00ad lant stated that the deceased Ram Dularey had asked him to take hisgoods in his cart and it wasagreed that Rs. 2 wouldbe paidas the fare. The appellant 1956 Wasim Khan v. The State of UttarPradc sh ImamJ. 1956 Wasim f(han v. The State of Uttar Pradesh Imam/. 194 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) took the deceased on his cart with his goods includ\u00ad ing the box Ex. 9. Two other menwerealso in the cart who got down at the Sugar Mill gate at the Rail\u00ad way Station. At the Raduayan Bridge three men enquired if Ram Dularey was in the cart. Ram Dularey responded and got downfrom the cart asking the appellant to halt his cart at Jarwal Bazar Bridge, wherehe waited for the deceased until 4 a.m., but the deceased did not turn up.As the appellant did not know the house of the deceasedin Jarwal Bazar, he took the dead man's goods in his cart to his own house as hisbuffaloeswere very hungry. To the ques\u00ad tion as to whether any article of the deceased was recoveredfrom his house by the police, the appellan_t stated that he handed over to the police all the pro\u00ad perty of the deceasedwhich he had locked in the kothri. He asserted that he had told the people in his village as wellas the Mukhia that he would hand over the property to its ownerwhen he came to take it. Concerning the knife,he disowned its ownership and could not say how it came to be found in his house. So far as the dhoti Ex. 3 is concerned, the appellant claimed it as his. On behalf of the appellant, it wasurged that the evidence iu the casewas insufficient to establish any of ~he chargesframed against him. In the alternative, it was suggested, that as the co-accused of the appellant had been acquitted the latter could not be convicted of the offence of murder by the appli\u00ad cation of the provisions of section 34 of the Indian Penal Code in the absence of proof that any act of hiscaused the death of Ram Dularey. It was also submitted that no questionwas put by the Sessions Judge to the appellant when he was examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure con\u00ad cerning the act of murder or robbery. We have examined the statement of the appellant recorded under section342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by the Sessions Judge. At the very com\u00ad mencement of the record of that statement, the Ses\u00ad sions Judge read out the appellant's statement under section342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 195 the Committing Magistrate and enquired whether it was correct, to which the appellant repliedin the affirmative. The statement of the appellant before the Magistrate is admissible under section287 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The Magistrate pointedly asked the appellant as to whether he along with the other accusedmurdered Ram Dularey and had taken his property to which the appellant replied in the negative. It was not necessaryfor the Sessions Judge to specifically repeat the same when the appellant admitted his statement before the Committing Magistrate as correctwhen read out to him. Apart from this, when the statement of the appellant to the Sessions Judge is read as a whole, it clearlyshows that the appellant knew what the accusation against him was and he offered an explanation for the dis\u00ad appearance of Ram Dularey fromhis cart and for hispossession of the deceased'sgoods. There is no justificationfor supposing that there had been any prejudice caused to the appellant on account of im\u00ad proper or insufficientrecording of his statement by the Sessions Judge under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On the facts provedbeyondquestion it is clear that the last time the deceasedwas seen alivewas in the company of the appellant and two other persons when the cart started for Jarwal and hisgoodswere on that cart. There is, however, no evidenceas to what happened in the course of the journey. Con\u00ad cerning that we have only the statement of the ac\u00ad cused. The evidence next establishes that after the cart started, next morning, the 3rd of July, the dead body of Ram Dularey wasfound not far from Jar\u00ad wal. His goods had disappeared and some of them at any rate werefoundin the possession of the appellant on the 6th of July. The real questionis whether the evidence in the caseestablishes that the appellant murdered and robbed Ram Dularey.The evidenceis circumstantial. Before we deal with that evidence, it is necessary to considerhow far recent possession of property of a deceased, in circumstancesclearly indicating that he 1956 Wasim Kha\" v. The State of UttarPradesh Jt11a1n J. 1956 WasimKhan v. The State of Uttat' Pt'ad.esli 196 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) had been murdered and robbed,would suggest that not only the possessor of the property was a thief or a receiver of stolen property, but that it alsoin\u00ad dicated that he was guilty of a more aggravated crimewhich had connection with the theft. In the case of The EmperrJr v. SheikhNeamatulla(') Sir Law\u00ad rence Jenkins had the occasion to examine this ques\u00ad tion. After referring to section114 of t.he Evidence Act, he quoted the followingpassage from Wills on Circumstantial Evidence: \"the possession of stolen goods recently after the loss of them, may be indicative not merely of the offence oflarceny, or of receiving with guilty know\u00ad ledge, but of any other more aggravated crime which has beenconnected with theft. This particular fact of presumption commonlyforms also a material ele\u00ad ment of evidence in cases of murder;which special application of it has often been emphatically recog\u00ad nized\". In the case of Queen-Empress v. Sami and Another(') at page432, the learned Judges of the High Court observed, \"Under thesecircumstances, and in the absence of any explanation, the presumption arises that any one who took part in the robbery also took part in the murder. In cases in which murder and robbery have beenshown to form parts of one trans\u00ad action, it has been held that recent and unexplained possession of the stolen property while it wouldbe presumptive evidence against a prisoner on the charge of robberywould similarlybe evidence against him on the charge of murder.All the facts which tell against the appellant, especially his conduct indicat\u00ad ing a consciousness of guilt, point equally to the con\u00ad clusion that hewas guilty as well of the murder as of the robbery .................... \". In the case of Emperor v. ChintamoniShahu('), the opinion was expressed that \"the possession of stolen goodsrecently after the loss of them may be indicative not merely of the offence of larceny or of receiving with guilty knowledge but of any other more aggravated crimewhich has been (1) [1918] 17 C.W.N.1077. {2) [1890] I.L.R. 18 Mad. '26, \u00b7 (8) A.I.R. 1930 C\u2022!. 879. ' S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 197 connected with the theft; this particular fact of pre\u00ad sumption forms also a material element of evidence in the case of murder\". A similar viewseems to have been taken in the case of In re Guli Venkataswamy(1) as well aa. in the case of RamprashadMakundram Raj\u00ad put v. The Orown( 9). In the present case it is established beyond doubt that the deceased travelled with his goods with the appellant on hisbullockcart. He should have reached his destination Jarwal in the course of the night. He never got there.Obviously,he was murdered onhis wayhome. On the appellant's own statement, he and the deceasedwere alone in the cart after the other two persons had got off the cart at the Sugar Mill gate. Thereafter the deceasedwas neverseen alive by any one. He wasfoundmurdered.The appellant was found in possession of the deceased's goods three days afterwards. The appellant made no effort to trace the whereabouts of the deceased or lodge information of hisdisappearancefrom the bul\u00ad lock cart. The appellant has told the court that some peoplecalled the deceasedwhile the cart was on its journey and the deceased told him to wait for him at a certain place. He waited until 4 a.m. but the de\u00ad ceasednever turned up. This should have aroused hissuspicions and he should have informed the police or someone in authority about it. He says hein\u00ad formed the Mv.khia and all the people about it. Neither the Mukhia nor anyone has beenexamined by the appellant to support his story.Reliancewas placedon the\u00b7statement of Iftikhar Ahmad P.W. 7, whospoke of a rumour in the village that the appel\u00ad lant had brought the property of a man on his cart who had gone away and that this rumour had been spread by the appellant. It is clear,however, that the witnesswas not speaking of this fromhis perso\u00ad nal knowledge and his statement is not legalevi\u00ad dence. On the other hand, if really the appellant had spread sucha rumour there is no adequate explana\u00ad tion forhisfailure to inform the authorities. He (1) A.I.R. 1950 Mad. 809. 26 (2) A.I.R. 1949 Nag. 277, 1956 Wasi111 Khan v. TheState of Uttar Praduh I111a111 J. 1956 Wasim Khan v. The State of UttarPradesh 198 SUPREMECOURT REPORTS (1956] knew he wasin possession of a large number of arti\u00ad clesbelonging to the man who had hired his cart but had disappeared in very strange circumstances. In addition, there is no explanation for his possession of a big blood-stained knife,a weapon which if used against the deceased,could have caused the injuries found on him. It is true that the blood stains were minute and have not been established to be of human blood. The appellant, however, denied that theknife belonged to him, and has not explained as to how it came to be in hispossession. It is impossible to be\u00ad lieve his story that he waited until 4 a.m.for the deceasedto return. The cart had started from Jarwal Road Station at about 10 p.m. It could not have been more than a couple of hours later that the de\u00ad ceased left the cart. To wait from that time until 4a.m. at a place not far from Jarwal itself appears to bea fantastic story. It is true that none of the clothes of the appellant werefound to be blood\u00ad stained, as they should have been, if he had parti\u00ad cipated in the murder, having regard to the nature of the injuries on the deceased. These clotheswere not seized until the 6th July, some three days later, and the appellant could have removed all traces of blood stains from his clothing in that time. The appellant was convicted of the offences of mur.der and robbery by the Sessions Judge by the application of section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The charge framed, however, was one of murder and robbery and there was no mention of these offences having been committed in the furtherance of a com\u00ad mon intention. The High Court, however, found that the appellant along with two others committed these offences and they shared in the goodsrobbed. On this finding, even if the co-accused of the appellant were acquitted, the appellant could be convicted by the application of the provisions of section34 of the Indian Penal Code. The charge framed against the appellant was for murder and robbery and the only question to be decided was whether the evidence was sufficient to support sucha charge or did it merely establishoffences less grave in nature. We think it ~\u00b7 - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 199 was and are satisfied thatit establishes the offences of murder and robbery against the appellant and not merely the minor offence of robbery or theft. It is impossible to accept the submission that the evidence does not establish any offence having been committed by the appellant. Having regard to what isestablishedin the case and the principles deducible from the cases cited, we are satisfied that the appellant has been rightly con\u00ad victed of the offences of murder and robbery.

The AssistantSessions Judge convictedthe appellantunder all the three chargesbut acquittedthe loursub\u00b7overseersgiving them the benefit of doubt.

On appeal by special leave to the Supreme Court the main questionfor consideration wa.s whether the rulingof the SupremeCourt in thecase of Topan Das v. TheState of Bombay ([1955] 2 S.O.R. 881),governedthe presentcase in viewof the fact that theappellantwas the onlypersonout of the accusedpersons on trial who had beenconvictedof the offence of conspiracyunder s. 120-B, !.P.O. Held (i) that the case of Topa1'Daa v. State of Bombay was clearly distinguishablefrom the presentcase as in that case the only personsalleged to have been guilty of theoffenceof conspiracywere thepersonsplaced on trial. Thora wasno allegation nor any S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 207 evidence forthcoming that any otherpersonsthough not placed on trial,were concernedwith the crime. On the findingsin that case, onlyone person,after the acquittal of the rest of theaccused,was concernedwith the crimeand stoodconvicted of the chargeof con\u00b7 1956 Bimbadhar Pradhan spiracy. As a personcannot be convictedof conspiringwith him\u00b7 v. . selfto commitan offence,the Supreme Court gaveeffectto the; con\u00b7 Th~ State 01 Orissa tention that on thefindingsand on theevidence,as alsoon the chargein that case, the convictioncould not be sustained. But in theinstantcase on thefindingsof thecourtsbelow, apart from the personsplaced on thetrial,there was the approverwho implicated himselfequallywith the otheraccusedpersonsand a numberof otherprosecutionwitnesses as having been privy to theconspiracy. And tlforefore thepresentcase was not on all fourswith the caseof Topan Das v. State of Bombay. (ii)Theprovisions of s. 225, Cr.P.O. wereclearlyapplicableto the facts and circumstancesof thepresentcase. It had notbeen shownhow the omissionto mentionthe name of theapproverin thechargeunder s. 120-B, I.P.C. had misledthe e,ppellant or had occasioned afailure of justice.

The Judgment of the Court wasdelivered by SINHA J.-The main question canvassed in this appeal by specialleave is whether the ruling of this Court iu the case of Topan Das v. The State of Bom\u00ad bay(') governs this case also, in view of the fact that the appellant is the only person out of the accused persons placed on trial, who has been convicted for the offence of conspiracy under section 120-B, Indian Penal Code. The point arises in the following way: '['he appellant and four others were placed on their trial before the Assistant Sessions Judge ofSall!balpur foroffences under sections 120-B,409, 477-A and 109, Indian Penal Code with having committed the offences of criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust in respect of Government property, and falsification of accounts with a view to defraud the Government. The appellant wa.s the District Food Production Officer in Sambalpur and the other four accused per\u00ad sonswere agricultural sub-overseers in charge of their respective areas under the appellant. Another such agricultural sub-overseer was Pitabas Sahu at Bargarh centre. He was examined at the trial as P.W. 25 and (I) [1955] 2 S,C.R. 881. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS '209 shall hereinafterbe referred to as the approver.The 1956 prosecutioncase is that in furtherance of the Grow Bimbadhar More Food Scheme initiated by Government it was Pradhan decided to subsidize the supply of oil cake to agricul- v. turists with a view to augmenting the production of The Stateo/Ori\"'6 foodcrops. Cultivators wereto besupplied this variety of manure at Rs. 4-4-0 per maund, though the Government had to spendRs. 7-12-0 per maund. The appellant entered into a conspiracywith his sub- ordinate staff including the agricultural sub-overseers aforesaid to misappropriate the funds thus placed at their disposalfor the procurement and supply of oil cake to cultivators.To bolster up the quantity of oil cakes to beprocured, they showedfalse transactions of purchase and distribution thereof and falsified accounts,vouchers, etc. Thus they wereallegedto have misappropriated the sum of Rs. 4,943-4-0 of Governmentmoney. Alargevolume of oral and documentaryevidence wasadducedon behalf of the prosecution.The three assessorswho assisted at the trial were of the opinion that none of the accusedwas guilty.The learned Assistant Sessions Judge in agreementwith the as\u00ad sessors acquitted the four agriculturalsub-overseers aforesaid of allcharges,giving them the benefit of the doubt. But in disagreementwith the assessors heconvicted the appellant underall the charges and sentencedhim to rigorous imprisonmentfor four and a half years and a fine of Rs. 2,000 under section 409, Indian Penal Code, and to rigorousimprisonmentfor two years eachundersections 120-B and 477-A of the Code, the sentences of imprisonment to run concur\u00ad rently. The learned trial Judge observed in the course of his judgmentas follows:- \"Hence on a consideration of all the evidenceas discussedabove, I find that the prosecutionhave fully proved their case that the accused Bimbadhar Pradhan, the D.F.P.O. hasconspired to embezzle the Governmentmoney. They have also proved that he has got anactive hand and in assistance of Pitabas Sinha/. 210 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 19S6 Sahu has embezzledGovernmentmoney amounting Bimbadhar to Ra. 4,943-4-0 and in that act he hasalsoactively Pradhan helped Pitabaa Sahu in falsifying the Government ... records by makingfalse entries.Hence all these TheState of Oris1ta threecharges have been conclusivelyproved against -him. So far as regards the other accused persona,I Sinha/. have already stated that they are ccmsiderablyinex\u00ad perienced and the doubtful nature of evidence against theseaccusedpersons and considering the position bet.ween the first.accused and the other accusedper\u00ad sons,I givethesefour accusedpersons the benefit of doubt thoughI do not approve their conduct in this affair. As per my findingsgiven above,I may state here that this is a case in which we find a person in charge of the entire administration of agricultural and G.M.F.development of a district has not only soiled hisownhands by embezzlingGovernmentmoney by corrupt means but has alsointroducedcorruption i~to the entire administration of that department by spoiling the career of young men whoare entrusted with this work and employed under him\". The appellant went up in appeal to the High Court of Orissa.A DivisionBench of that Court allowed hisappeal and set asidehis convictions and sentences uhdersections 409 and 477-A, Indian Penal Code, but upheldhis conviction and sentence in respect of the charge of conspiracyunder section 120-B of the Code. We need not enter into the correctness of the findings of the trial court in respect of the acquittal of the other fouraccused, or of the High Court with regard to the acquittal of the appellant in respect of the chargesunder sections 409 and 477-A, Indian Penal Code. The High Court held that though the appel\u00ad lant had withdrawn the sum of Rs. 27,000 from the Government treasury with a view to subsidizing the procurement_ofoil cake, it had not been proved that there was an entrustment to the appellant. Hence the charge against him undersection 409 failed.As -regards the charge under section 477-A, the High - - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 211 Court acquitted him on the ground that the docu\u00ad 1956 ments said to have beenfalsified,which were largein Bimbadhar number, had not been mentionedin the charge and a Pradhan vague statement that \"accounts, cash books,stock v. books, petty cash sale register,cash memos,applica- The State o/Orissa tions from cultivators,receipts, bills, vouchers, SinliaJ. papers,documents,letters, correspondencei etc. had been falsified\" was made. As regards the charge of conspiracyunder section 120-B, the High Courtobserved that the most important witness to prove the charge was the appro\u00ad ver aforesaid (P.W. 25) who had givena full descrip\u00ad tion of the conspiracyon the 23rd or 25thSeptember 1947between the appellant and other sub-overseers including himselffor the purpose of showin'g bogus purchases and bogusdistribution of large quantities of oil cake. It alsoobserved that \"Most of the witnessesexaminedby the prosecution to corroborate the evidence of Pitabas are themselvesaccomplices in the conspiracy\". TheHigh Court found that in res\u00ad pect of that conspiracy the evidencegiven by the approver got adequate corroborationfrom other inde\u00ad pendentwitnesses.After setting out the evidence the High Courtrecorded the following finding:- \"This would he strongestcorroboration of the evidence of the approver about the appellantbeing the prime mover and the brain behind the entire fraud. It was he who wanted to misusehis officialposition and persuadehis subordinates to joinwithhim in showingfalse procurement and distributionfigures of oilcakes\". And finally the HighCourtcame to the following conclusion:- . \"I am therefore of the opinion that the appro\u00ad ver's version about the leading part in the conspiracy played by the appellant in persuadingall his subordi\u2022 . nates to join withhim for the purpose of committing criminalbreach of trust of the sums withdrawnfrom the treasury by showing false procurement and distri\u00ad bution of oilcakeis true.Thereis independentcorro- 212 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 boration of his evidencewhich is inconsistent with the appellant being amere negligentsuperior officer Bimbadltar Pradilan who was deceived and defrauded by his dishonest sub- \u2022\u00b7 ordinates. It was then urged that in the charge under TileState o/ o,;,.. section 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, the date of the commission of the offencewas stated to be the SinilaJ. month of October1947, whereasaccording to the evidence of P.W. 5, the conspiracy took place at Bargarh between the 23rd and 25th September 1947. Thisdiscrepancy in the date is immaterial and has not prejudiced the appellant in any way''. From the concurrent orders of conviction and sen\u00ad tence of the appellant under section 120-B, Indian Penal Code, he was granted specialleave to appeal to this Court. The learnedcounsel for the appellant has raised the following points in support of the appeal:- 1. 'l'ha t all the personscharged with the offence of conspiracy except the appellant having been acquit\u00ad ted, his conviction and sentence in respect of that chargecould not in law be maintained; 2. That the appellant himself having been acquitted of the substantive charges under sections 409 and 477-A of the Code, he could not be convicted forconspiracyto commit those very offences; 3. That the evidence of the prosecution wit\u00ad nesses having beendisbelievedas against the other accused, the same evidence should not have been relied upon for convicting the appellant of the charge of conspiracy; 4. That the provisions of section342, Code of CriminalProcedure, had not been fullycomplied with in so far as important circumstances in the prosecu\u00ad tionevidence had not been put to the appellant in his examination by the court under that section. In our opinion, there is no substance in any one of these contentions and we proceed to give our reasons for our conclusions. In support of the first contention raised on behalf of the appellant strong reliance was placed on the S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 213 recent decision of this Court in Topan Das v. State of 1956 Bombay( 1 ) and the rulingsrelied upon in that case. Bimbadhar The cases, The Queen v. Manning( 9), TheQueen v. Pradhan Thompson(8) and The King v. Plummer(') werecited v. in support of the contention that where all the The State of Ori&sa accusedpersons except one are acquitted on a charge of conspiracy, the conviction of oneonlyon that Sinha J. charge cannot be sustained. / In this connection the recent decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of KannangaraAratchige Dharma- sena v. TheKing( 5 ) may alsobe referred to, though it was not cited at the Bar. In that case the Judicial Committeeheld that where only two persons are involved in a charge of conspiracy, if a new trial has to be directed in respect of one it shouldbe ordered in respect of both, because the onlypossibleconclu- sion in sucha casewas either that both were guilty or that neither was guilty of the offence. The recent decision of this Court so strongly reliedupon by the appellant lays down a. similarrule, but is clearly distinguishable from the case in hand inasmuch as in that case the onlypersonsalleged to have been guilty of the offence of conspiracywere the persons placed on trial. There was no allegation nor any evi- denceforthcoming that any other personswere, though not placed on trial, concerned with the crime. In those circumstances this Court la.id jt down that it was essential to bring the charge of conspiracy home to the accusedperson or persons to prove that there was an agreement to commit an offence bet- ween two or more persons. On the findings in that case onlyone person, after the acquittal of the rest of the accusedwas concerned with the crime and stood convicted of the charge of conspiracy.As a person cannot beconvicted of conspiring with himself to commit an offence, this Court gave effect to the contention that on the findings and on the evidence, 11) [1966)2 s.c.R. 881. (2) (1883] 12 Q.B.D 241. (SJ (1861] 16 Q.B.882: 117 E.R. 1100. (4) (1902)2 K. B. 889. (5) (1951) A.O. l, 214 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] as also on the charge in that case the conviction could not be sustained. But in the instant case, as Blmbadhar Pradhan already indicated, on the findings of the courts be- 19$6 v. low, apart from the personsplaced on trial, there The State o/Orissa was the approver who implicated himself equally Sinha]. with the other accusedpersons and a number of other prosecutionwitnesses as having been privy to the conspiracy. The evidence of the approver has been found by the courts below to have been materially corroborated both as to the unlawful agreement and as to the persons concerned with the conspiracy. In the first information report lodged on the 28th June 1948 the approver Pitabas Sahu, one of the agricultural sub-overseers,was named along with the other five accused as the persons concerned with the conspiracy. Subsequently Pitabas Sahu aforesaid was granted pardon on condition of his making a full and true statement of the facts of the case and was examined as an approver, onwhoseevidence mainly rested the case against the accused. His evidence. as indicated above,was supported by the dealers in oil\u00ad cake who supplied the commodity whichwas the subject matter. of the conspiracy. It cannot there\u00ad fore be said that this case is on all fours with the recent decision of this Court referred to above. But it was argued on behalf of the appellant that he waschargedonly with a conspiracy with the other accusedpersons and not with any conspiracy with the approver along with those others. The charge under section 120-B is in these terms: \"First, that you, on or about the month of Octo\u00ad ber, 1947 in the district of Sambalpur agreed with Hemchandra Acharya and other accusedpersons to do or caused to be done an illegal act by illegal means and that you did some acts in pursuance of the said agreement to wit, the offence of criminal breach of trust under s. 409,I.P.C. and falsification of accounts under s. 477-A punishable with R.

SUPREME COURT REPORTS 215 able under s. 120-B, I.P.C., and within the cognizance of court of Sessions\". 1956 Bimbadhat' It will thus appear from the words of the charge that Pradhan the approver was not specifically named as having . v, . been one of the conspirators,unless he couldbe The State 01 Orissa brought within the category of \"other accused per\u00ad sons\". Somethingwill have to be said as to what those wordsdenote, whether the approver was also included within that description. Counsel for the appellant contended that theydid not. Counsel for the State Governmentcontended to the contrary. In England an indictment consists of three parts: (1) the commencement, (2) the statement of the offence, and (3) the particulars of the offence. The English law of indictment from very early times has been basedon verytechnicalrules. Those rules have now beencodified by the Indictments Act, 1915 (5 & 6 George5, Chapter 90). In Rule 2 (Schedule I) of the Actas amendedby the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1933, the form of \"the commencement of the indictment\" has been prescribed. The form of \"Statement of the offence\" hasbeenprescribed by Rule 4 of the Act and below that has to follow \"Particulars of offence\" as re- quired by Rule 5. Thoserules more or lesscorres- pond to the ruleslaid downin Chapter XIX of the Code of CriminalProcedure. Section 221, Code of Criminal Procedure,requires that the charge shall state the offence with which the accused is charged, giving the specificname of the offence, if such a name has beengiven by the law whichcreates the offence, which in this casemeans the offence of criminal conspiracy,defined by section 120-A, Indian Penal Code. The naming of the section is, under sub-sec- tion (5) of section221, Code of CriminalProcedure, equivalent to a st.atement that everylegal condition required by law to constitute the offence of criminal conspiracycharged against the appellant was fulfilled. Section 222 of the Code requires that the particulars as tothetimeand placeof theallegedoffence,and Sinha J. 216 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 the person (if any) against whom, or the thing (if Bimbadhar any) in respect of which, the offence was committed, Pradhan shall be stated. It is noteworthy that that section v. wh!Ch requires the particulars of the offence to be Th< Stat\u2022 o/Orissa stated does not in terms further require that in an Sinha J. offencelike conspiracy the names of the co-conspira\u00ad tors should also be mentioned. Hence in England it is enough if the indictment states that the accused along with other persons unknown had committed the offence of criminal conspiracy. Though the sta\u00ad tute law in India does not make it obligatory that the persons concerned in the crime of criminal con\u00ad spiracy should be specifically named along with the person or persons charged in a particular trial, it is always advisable to givethose particulars also in order to give a reasonable notice to the accused that he has been charged with having conspired with so and so (persons named), as also persons unnamed, to commit a certain offence. In this case the charge against the fiveaccused persons with reference to section 120-B, Indian Penal Code, named only those five persons as the conspirators and omitted to name the approver also as having been privy to the conspiracy. This is clearly brought out with ref\u00ad erence to the charge framed against the other four accused(who have been acquitted by the trial court as aforesaid). It states:- \"That you, on or about the month of October 1947 in the district of Sambalpur, agreed with Bim\u00ad badhar Pradhan to do or caused to be done an illegal act by illegal means .................... \". We find with reference to the records of the trial court that the trial has not been characterised by thoroughness or circumspection. The date of the offence as given in the charge is different from the date as disclosed in the evidence, as pointed out by the High Court, whichfound that that mistake had not caused any prejudice to the accused. Similarly, the charge under section 477-A had not, as held by the High Court, been framed with sufficient parti- S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 217 cularity as a result of which the appellant had to be 7956 acquitted of that charge on appeal. If the charge Bimbadhar under section120-B had added the words \"and other Pradhan persons, known or unknown\", there would have been v. no ground for a grievanceon the part of the appel- The State of Orissa lant. But eve11 so, in our opinion, the provisions of sec- SinhaJ. tion 225,Code of CriminalProcedure, are clearly ap- plicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. It has not been shown to us how the omission to mention the name or'the approver in the charge under section120-B, Indian Penal Code, has misled the appellant or has occasioneda failure of justice. The prosecutioncase throughout has been,as is clear with reference to the petition of complaint, that the appellant with his subordinates in the Food Depart- ment had conspired to misappropriate the funds allocated to the procurement of oil-cake with aview to helping agriculturists with manure to raisemore food crops. The approver has been very much in the picture all the time and, as a matter of fact, as found by the courts below,his evidenceis the main plank in the prosecutioncase. Of course, there is the other corroborative evidence, as pointed out in the judg- ments of the courts below. The provisions of section 537 are equally attracted to this case. With reference to the provisions of that section it is pertinent to note that though the other accused had been acquitted by the trial court and though hewas the only appel- lant in the High Court,he did not raise the points with reference to the allegedillegality or irregularity in the charge,before that court. Hence applying the Explanation to that section to this case, it cannot be urged that the omissionin the charge has occasioned afailure of justice. But the learned counselfor the appellant has in\u00ad vited our pointed attention to the observations of Mr. Justice Mathew at p. 243 of Queenv. Manning(1) that it is \"an imperative rule of law\" that \"in a (1)[1883) 12 Q.B.D. 241. 218 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 charge for conspiracyin a case like this where there are two defendants, the issueraisedis whether or not Bimbadhar Pradha,. both the men are guilty, and if the jury are not satis- v. fied as to the guilt of either, then both must be ac- The State ofOrissa quitted\". But Lord Coleridge, C. J., whose direction Sinha}. to the jury in that casewas the subject matter of the judgment does not put it as high as Mr. Justice Mathew, but understood it \"to be the established rule of practice\". Reliancewas placed by the learnedcounselfor the appellant on the case of The King v. Plummer(1), in which it has beenobserved that with the acquittal of the only alleged conspirators no verdict of guilty against the appellant couldbe passedbecause the verdict would be regarded as repugnant,, in so far as it would amount to saying that there wasa criminal agreement between the appellant and the others and none between them and him.Hence it was contended that in a situation such as the present case presents, the conviction of the appellant would amount to a similar repugnancy.This aspect of the matter has been well discussedin a judgment of the Calcutta High Court delivered by Mr. Justice Mukerjiin the case of I. G. Singleton v. The King-Emperor('). Thi. learned Judge has there pointed out the difference between the positionas it obtains in India and that in England. The rule of English law as to the acquit\u00ad tal of an alleged conspirator followingfrom the acquittal of the other when the conspiracywas said to be onlybetween the two and in a joint trial of both is based upon a rule of practice and procedure, namely' that repugnancy or contradiction on the face of the record isa ground for annulling a conviction. But such a repugnancy is not by itself a sufficient ground for quashing aconvictionin India where the matter is governed by statutory law both as to the offence and the procedurefor bringing the offender to justiee. In India there is noprovision in the statutory law justifying an interference with a convictionon the (ll [1902] 2 K.B. 33~. (,2) (1924] 29 C.W N. 260. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 219 ground of repugnancy in the record. That is not to 19$6 say that the court is to shut its eyes to the inconsist- Bimbadhar ency in convictingone person of the offence of con- Pradhan spiracy on the sameevidenceon which the other v. allegedconspirator had been acquitted. If the matter The State o/Orissa is as simpleas that, ordinarily the courts will haveno difficultyin setting aside the conviction,when there was absolutely nothing on the record to distinguish the case against the one from that against the other. Such was the casewhichwas decided by this Court in TopanDas v. State of Bombay(1). Learned couqsel for the appellant pressedupon us the consideration that notwithstanding the state of affairsas disclosedin the evidence, the appellant was entitled to an acquittal because in the charge. as framed against himtherewas no reference to the approver.He contended that the ruleuponwhich the accusedwas entitled to an acquittal was not a matter of practice but of principle. In the instant case we a.re not sure that the acquittal of the co-accused by \u00b7the trial court was wellfounded in law or justified by the evidence in the case. The trial court has not dis\u00ad believed the evidenceled on behalf of the prosecution. It has onlygiven the benefit of the doubt to the accusedwhom it acquitted on grounds which ma:y not bear scrutiny. But as the case against those acquitted personsis not before us, weneed not go any further into the matter. It has further beencontended by the learned c~mnsel for the appellant that the High Court having acquitted him in respect of the two substantive charges of criminalbreach of trust and of falsification of documentshe should not have beenconvicted of the offence of criminalconspiracybecause the con\u00ad spiracywas allegedto have been\u00b7 forthosevery pur\u00ad poses. It isa sufficientanswer to this contention to say that the offence of criminal conspiracyconsists in the very agreementbetween two or morepersons to commit a criminaloffence irrespective of the (1) [1955] ~ S.O.R. 881. .Sinha]. 220 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 7956 further consideration whether or not those offences Bimbadhar have actually beencommitted.The very fact of the Pradhan conspiracy constitutes the offence and it is immaterial v. whether anything has been donein pursuance of the The State of Orissa unlawful agreement. But in this case the findingis Sinha]. not that Government money had not been misappro-. priated or that the accounts had not beenfalsified. The charge under section477-A relating to the falsi\u00ad fication of the documents has failed because the High Court found that that particular chargewas wanting in sufficient particulars, thus causingprejudice to the accused. The charge under section 409, Indian Penal Code, was set aside by the High Court on the ground that there was \"practically no evidence of entrust\u00ad ment with the appellant of the price of 1500 maunds of oil-cakes,a substantial portion of which he was said to have misappropriated\". How far this obser\u00ad vation of the High Court is wellfounded in law with reference to the officialposition of .the appellant who had the spending of the Government money in his hands is not a matter on whichwe need pronounce. It is enough to point out that it has not been found by the courts below that the object of the criminal conspiracy had not beenachieved. On the other hand, there is enough indication in those judgments thl!>t the object of the conspiracy had been to a large extent fulfilled.Hence it must be held that there is no substance in this contention also. Another contention raised on behalf of the appel\u00ad lant was that the other accused having been acquitted by the trial court, the appellant should not have beenconvictedbecause the evidence against all of them was the same. There would have been a great deal of force in this argument, not as a question of principle but as a matter of prudence, if we were satiRfied that the acquittal of the other four accused persons was entirely correct. In this connection the observations of this Court in the case of Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab('), and of the Federal Court in (1) [196~) S.C.R. U6, 166. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 221 Kapildeo Singh v. The King(1) are relevant. It is not 1956 essential that more than one personshouldbe con- Bimbadhar victed of the offence of criminalconspiracy. It is Pradhan enough if the court is in a position to find that two v. ormorepersonswere actually concernedin the crimi- The state of Oriua nal conspiracy. If the courts below bad come to the distinct finding that the evidenceled on behalf of SinhaJ. the prosecution was unreliable, then certainly no conviction could have been bali!ed on suchevidence and all the accusedwould have been equally entitled to acquittal. But that is not the position in this case aswe read the judgments of the courts below. Lastly, it wascontended that the examination of the appellant by the learned trial Judge was not in full compliance with the requirements of section 342, Code of Criminal Procedure.Two points have been sought to be made in this connection. Firstly, it bas been contended that though the other accusedwho have been acquitted by the trial court were ques\u00ad tioned with. reference to the conspiracy with the approver Pitabas Sahu, no such questionwas put to the appellant. It is true that the court questioned him about his \"conspiracy with the other accused persons\". Counsel for the parties before us did not agree as to the significance of the words \"in con\u00ad spiracy with the other accused persons\". The con\u00ad tention on behalf of the appellant was that they re\u00ad ferred only to the persons actually standing trial before the court, whereascounsel for the State con\u00ad tended that they had reference to all the accused per\u00ad sons named in the petition of complaint including the approver.A number of rulings of the different'High Courts as to what is the position of an approver, whether he continues to be an accused person even after the grant of pardon or whether he is only in the position of a witness on behalf of the prosecution, werecitedbeforeus. But we do not think it neces\u00ad sary in this case to pronounceupon that because we have, as already indicated, come to our conclusions (1) (1949-50] F.C.R. 834, 837, 838. 29 222 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 on theassumption that there is an omission in the charge in so faras the approverhas not been specifi\u00ad Blmbadhar Pradhan cally namedin the charge under section120-B, Indian v. Penal Code.Secondly, it was contended that the Th\u2022 Slat\u2022 o/Ori .. a evidence of P.W. 27 who had been chieflyrelied upon - in the courts below as corroborating the approver had Sinha/. not been specifically put to the appellant though the evidence of the approver Pitabas Sahu was pointedly put to him. In our opinion, it is not ordinarily necessary to put the evidence of eachindividual witness to the accused in hisexaminationunder sec\u00ad tion 342, Code of CriminalProcedure.The appellant \u00b7was put the question \"Have you got anything to .say on the evidence of the witnesses?\" That, in our opinion, is sufficient in the circumstances of this case to show that the attention of the accusedwas called to the prosecutionevidence. As to what is or is not a run compliance with the provisions of that section of the Code must depend upon the facts and circum\u00ad stances of each case. In our opinion, it cannotbe said that the accused has been in any wayprejudiced by the wayhe hasbeenquestionedunder that section. .. --- As all the contentionsraised on behalf of the ap\u00ad pellant fail, the appeal must stand dismissed."

H. J. Umrigar, for. appellant No. 1. K. R. Olwuilhry, for appellants Nos.2 to 4. Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Golchale, for the respon\u00ad dent. 1956.March14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHA.RA AIYAR J.-The four appellants and two others named Sheshaya and Pitchi Reddy, who are all communists,were charged with the mur\u00ad der of one V enka takrishna Sh as try who was a Cong\u00ad ress worker or leader. The appellants were convicted of the offence but the other two were acquitted by the Sessions Judge, Warangal, Hyderabad State, on the astounding ground that no overt acts were proved against them. The appellants preferred appeals to the High Court at Hyderabad and there was the usualreferencefor confirmation of the death sentencesimposed on them. The appeals were heard by a Bench consisting of Deshpande J. and Dr.Mir Siadat Ali Khan J. and S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 249 they disagreed with each other.Deshpande J. held that the evidence did not establishthe. guilt of the appellants and he acquitted them. On the other hand, Dr. Mir Siadat Ali Khan came to the conclusion that the prosecution had established its casebeyond rea\u00ad sonabledoubt. He confirmed the convictions but reduced the sentences to imprisonmentfor life. Owing to this difference of opinion, the matter wasreferred to a third Judge, Manohar Persbad J. and he agreed with the finding of guilty given by hislearned bro\u00ad ther Dr. Mir Siadat Ali Khan. Wegrantedspecial leave to the appellants to comebefore this court. Thefacts of the occurrence,as alleged by the prosecution,are these. On the evening of 19-1-1949, the deceased Venkatakrishna \"Shastry of the village of Maturpeta and five other persons, who were Con\u00ad gressworkerslike him, were returning to the village froma tank. One of the communistleaders called Nagabhushan Rao hadbeenarresteda month or two previously and the communist party believed that Venkatakrishna Shastry wasresponsiblefor the arrest. So a largegroup of communists, about 25 or 30 in numberincluding the accused,armed with guns and swords,paid a visit to Maturpeta to wreak vengeanceagainst the Congress group led by .Venkata\u00ad krishna.Shastry.They ran into the Congress group as they weregettingback to the village after the evening stroll. P. W. 14, a dhobi boynamedGopai was one of the camp followers of this communistgroup. Venkatakrishna Shastry and his co-workers \u00b7were tied up with their ownclothes and wereled to the village chavadi over whicha Congressflag wasflying.A rope wasbroughtfrom the house of P.W. 17 and the mem\u00ad bers of the Congress group were tied with this rope and led somedistanceaway from the village to a red-gramfield, and all of them were beaten by their enemies;except Shastry, the rest were drivenaway from the place. Sh~stry wastiedwith the rope and taken in the easterndirectionby Mangapaty(the dalamor troop leader) and the accused.P.W. 14 was following the groupcarryinga bundle of theirclothes onhishead.After a short halt at the villageof 1956 Vemireddy Satyanarayah Reddy and three other$ v. The State of Hyderabad ChandrasekharR Aiyar J. 1956 Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddy and three others v. The State of Hyderabad Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. 250 SUP:R.EME COURT REPORTS [1956] Suknevedu,where some foodwas taken, the party went toward.s a mango-tope near abrook,four or five miles away leading Venkatakrishna Shastry as the captive. The deceased,Gopai (P.W. 14) and some of the accused remained on the hank of the brooklet. The others went a little beyond and one of them came back with orders that Venkatakrishna Shastry should be fetched. Venkatakrishna Shastry was taken along and when the moonwas at the meridian, the rope with which he wasled wastied round the neck of the deceased into a noose.Two of the accused pulledone end of the rope and two others at the other end in oppositedirections. Venkatakrishna Shastry was thus strangled to death. A pit was dug and the body of Venkatakrishna Shastry was buried in the river-bed. P. W. 14 saw all this from a distance of twenty yards in clearmoonlight. Two or three days later, after somewanderings in the jungle and mountain-dens P.W. 14 left the com\u00ad pany of his masters whowereimplored by the boy's father P. W. 7 to permit him to take the boy away. Next morninga report was sent by P.W. 2 the police pate! about the abduction of Venkatakrishna Shastry and investigation was begun. On 8-2-1949, that is about twenty days after the occurrence,some bones of a human-body werediscovered in the river\u00ad bed as the result of crows and vultures hovering round the place. The police Patwari (P. W. 10) sent a report about this discovery. The police arrived on the scene and exhumed the body whichwas identified as that of Venkatakrishna Shastry. This was on 9-2-1949. It was sent for post-mortem examination. The condition in which the body was at the time of exhumation is stated in a panchnama that was then prepared. Theresults of the post-mortem examina\u00ad tion are spoken to by the doctor P.W. 7. Being the onlywitnessfor the commission of the crime, the dhobi boy (P. W. 14) was subjected to severe criticism by Mr. Umrigar whoheld the dock brief for the appellants. He describedhim as an accomplice and as an unmitigated liar and he askedus not even to look at his evidence. P.W. 14 does not satisfy the - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 251 definition of an accomplice;he fallssomewhat short of the requirementswhich wouldconfer on him this status. According to the evidence,he left his parents' roof after a quarrel with his father and whilewandering in the jungleshe waspicked up by the communistsonly 3 days before and taken as their servant on promise to givehim food.His main duty appears to havebeen to go with the group carrying their bundles of clotheson hishead. It was in this capacity that he was not onlyable to see the abduction of the deceased but also to witness the actual murder.He tookno part whatever in the com\u00ad mission of the offenceor in any active or passive preparationsfor the same. He was not a particepscri\u00ad mines. Aftersecuringhis releasefrom his temporary masters,he wentback with his father to the village. It is true he did not divulge the secret of the murder to any oneelseexceptto hisownfather. But who would, in view of the. atrocities and terrorism that prevailedin that region during the relevant time? It required a verycourageousman to have proclaimed the truth, needless of consequences to himself, and we cannot creditthe dhobi boy with so much of fearless\u00ad ness.The learnedcounsel urged that if a mansees the perpetration of a crime and does not give informa\u00ad tion of it to anyoneelse, he mightwell be regarded in lawas an accomplice and that he couldbe put in the dock with the actual criminals.There is, how\u00ad ever, no warrant for such an extremeproposition. On the other hand, the following short passage from Russellon Crime, 10th Edition,page 1846,will show its untenability:- \"But a personmay be present, and, if not aiding and abetting,be neitherprincipal nor accessory;as, if A, happens to be present at a murder and takesno part in it, nor endeavours to prevent it, or to ap\u00ad prehend the murderer,this course of conductwill not of itself renderhim eitherprincipalor accessory\". Indeed, there can be no doubt that the evidence of a manlike P. W. 14 shouldbe scannedwith much caution and we must befullysatisfied that he is a witness of truth, especiallywhen no other person 1956 Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddyand three others v. The State of Hyderabad Chandrasekhara MyarJ. 1956 Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddy and three others v. The State of Hyderabad Chandrasekhara Aiyar }. 252 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] was present at the time to see the murder. Though he was not an accomplice,we would still want corroboration on material particulars in this parti\u00ad cular case, as he is the onlywitness to the crime and as it wouldbe unsafe to hang fourpeople on bis sole testimony unlesswe feelconvinced that he is speaking the truth. Such corroboration need not, however,be on the question of the actual commission of the offence; if this was the requirement, then we would have independent testimony on which to act and there wouldbe noneed to rely on the evidence of onewhoseposition may, in this particular case, be . said to be somewhat analogous to that of an accom\u00ad plice, though not exactly the same. What the law requiresis that there should be such corroboration of the material part of the. story connecting the accused with the crime as will satisfy reasonable minds that the man canbe regarded as a truthful witness. In the leadingcase. of Rex v. Baskerville(') it was pointed by Lord Reading C.J. that \"the corro\u00ad boration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of hisconnection with the crime. The nature of the corroborationwill depend on and vary according to the particular circumstances of each case. What is requiredis some additional evidence rendering iti probable that the story of the accompliceis true and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it. Judged by this test, we can say that the evidence given by P.W. 14 has been amply corroborated. It was not disputed for the appellants that there is abundant evidenceconsisting of the testimony of several witnesses in support of the truth of the narra\u00ad tive given by P.W. 14 regarding the abduction of the deceased. This evidencewas given not by mere on\u00ad lookers but by menlike P.Ws. 3, 4,5, 6 and 9,who were with the deceasedwhen the communist group came upon them\u00b7 and who werethemselves badly beaten up by the gang beforebeing releasedfrom impending death at the \u00b7merciful intervention of (1)[1916)2 K.B.D.668 S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 253 some one of them. They say that at the time of the release the accusedretained the deceased with\u00b7them and took him away in the direction of Mulgupad. From this stage,P.W.14takes us to the rivQr bank where the deceased and he wereallowed to sit. The accusedwent into the river bed and later on orders wereissued by the appellant ;No. 1, the deceasedwas led by aropefrom the bank by Muthyalu(4th appel\u00ad lant). The ropewas tied round the neckof the deceased into a noose and pulled in oppositedirec\u00ad tions by two of the accusedon eachside and Shastry was thus strangled to death.His bodywas buried in a pit dug in the riverbed.The ropewhichwas foundround the neck of the dead bodywhen it was exhumedis said to be the rope with whichP.Ws.3 to 6 and 9 were tied up and as the one that the members of the gang brought from the house of Silam Brahma-. reddi (P.W. 17) earlier that eveningwhen the village was raided and the Congressworkers were marched to the Congressflag. . There is alsoevidence that the party of the accusedwhen they first encountered the party of the deceasedasked who and where was Venkatakrishna. Shastry. The assailants,who were armed to the teeth, indulged in threats to kill all of them. The deceasedwas a.. Congress leader and it is not surprising that he wassingled out for terrific,punishment,while the others were let off with a good thrashing and admo\u00ad nitions that they shouldgive up their Congress affi\u00ad liations. It is but natural in the circumstances that they should take a.way the deceased to a distant place to do a.waywith him. That he wasso ledby the group of the accusedis alsocorroborated . by the evidence of Yesob (P.W. 12) whowas watchinghis jawar crop on the night in question in a neighbouring field. Let usnow turn J;o the exhumation of the dead body, the inquestreport, the post-mortemcertificate, and the evidence of the doctor (P. W. 7). The patwari of Sa.krivedu (P. W. 10) sent a report on the 8th February, 1949, that he had information that a dead body lay buried in the river-bed. The report has not 1956 Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddy and threeothers v. The State of Hyderabad Chandrasekhara Aiyar J, 1956 Vetnircddy Satyanarayan Reddy and three others v. The Stale of Hyderabad Chaudrasckliara Aiyar J. 254 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] been filed but its purport about the condition of the body is given in the inquest report as unidentifiable. Two policesub-inspectors and some constables reach\u00ad ed the river-bed the same day and exhumed the body. Its then conditionis describedin thesewordsin the inquest report: \"It was noticed that a rope of Chinna and Am\u00ad bara waswrappedfrom neck to the waist. Both hands were missing and out of the two legsone was attached to the body with little flesh. The bones of the other separated leg (thedown part of the knee) and the bones of one hand werefoundin the pit. Therewere some hairs in the head. The flesh of the facewas rotten and decayed. Teeth are safe and sound. There is rotten fleshfrom the neck to the buttocks. It appears that this dead body is of a Hindu Brahmin\". The panchnama is signed by twopersons,one of whom HAS BEEN EXAMINED AS P.W. 16. He, along with the witnesseswho gaveevidenceas co\u00ad sufferers with the deceased in the communist raid of that evening, have identified the body as that of Venkatakrishna Shastry. The doctor's post-mortem certificateis exhibit 2 and according to it the body was putrified and even the marks of strangulation could not be detected; both the palms had been cut out, the left hand wassevered completely; there was only the left eye in a rotten condition; the right eye was not found, the right ear was not there. Examined as P.W. 7, the doctor has said that the face of the corpsecould not be identified, as the scalpwas eaten away by mud, and the bony structure of the face was present. In the face of this evidence, the learnedcounsel for the appellants contended with much force that identi\u00ad fication must have been impossible and that the wit\u00ad nesseswho speak to the same shouldbe disbelieved. Two factors are,however,overlookedin this argu\u00ad ment. Though the body was in an advanced state of decomposition and many parts of the limbs were missing and even the flesh in the facewasgone, it would not have beendifficultfor closeassociates of S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 255 Venkatakrishna Shastry to say that it was his corpse, from the generalfeaturesform, outline, contour build of the body, and the appearance of such of the limbs aswereavailable to see.His friendMadhusudhana Rao, P. W. 15,wasworking with the deceasedfor someyears in the Congress office and knewhim well indeed.There is hisevidence about identification. More important stillis the identification of the rope round the neck of the body, the dhoti with the violet border that wason its waist, and the janjam or the holy thread. The ropewas broughtfrom the house of Brahma Reddy (P.W. 17). It was the one which wastiedin loops round eachmember of the Congress groupas they were led from the villageto the red\u00ad gram field; it was the rope that was usedto lead Venkatakrishna Shastry to the brooklet; and it was the rope that wasfound round the neck of the dead bodywhen it was unearthed. The bordered dhoti whichwas on the corpsebelonged to Venkatakrishna Shastry. From these external marks, and the general features,friends of the deceased like P.Ws. 3 to 6 and 9 and P.W. 17 in whosehouse Shastry was living couldsay, we think, that the body buriedin the waist-deep pit in the bed of the river was that of Venkatakrishna Shastry. Whether he is regardedas an accomplice or as the sole witness of the offence P.W. 14 has been corrobo\u00ad rated in sucha manner that hisevidence about the steps taken by the accusedimmediately prior to the perpetration of the murder carries conviction to our minds.The connection of the accused with the crime must be held to havebeen madeout.We havealso to accept that the dead bodyrecoveredwas that of Venkatakrishna Shastry and no question of the ab\u00ad sence of the bodyarises. For this gruesome and revolting murder the appel\u00ad lants have got only imprisonmentfor life for which they mustbe thankful to the difference of opinion that aroseamong the learned Judges of the High Court. The appealfails and is dismissed. 81 1956 Vemireddy Satyanarayan Reddy and three other& v. The State of Hyderabad Chandrasekhara Aiyar J."

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-This appeal comes beforeus ona certi\u00ad ficate granted by the Madras High Court that the case wasa fitonefor appeal to this Court as it involved two important questions, n;i,mely, the powers of the Government under section64-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939,as amended by the MotorVehicles (MadrasAmendment)Act, 1948for the State of Madras(hereinafterreferred to as the Act), to inter\u00ad fere with the orders of subordinate Transport Auth\u00ad orities on the ground of propriety and the limits of judicial reviewwhich the courts have underarticle 226 of the Constitution of India. The appellant and respondentNo. 2 had applied forstage-carriagepermits in the Mayuram Town Ser\u00ad vice for routesNos. I and 2. Theseapplications, along with others,were considered by the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore. By its order dated the 31st of M;ay, 1954, it granted a permit for route No. I to the appellant and for route No. 2 to respon\u00ad dent No. 2. Both the appellant and respondentNo. 2 beingdissatisfiedappealed under section 64 of- the Act to the appropriate authority, the Central Road Traffic Board (hereinafterreferred to as the Board), but the appeals were dismissed by its order dated the 18th of August,1954. As section64-A conferred upon the State Government certain powers,which have 7956 Ramanand RamanUd. v. TheState of Madras and - another 1956 Raman and RamanUd. v. The State oj 1.fadras and another lmt11n J. 258 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] beendescribedin this case as revisionalpowers, the appellant and respondent No. 2 filed representations thereunder before the State Government against the orders of the Regional Transport Authority and the Board. The State Government set aside the orders passed by the aforesaid authorities and directed that permits for both the routesNos. l and 2 beissued to respondent No. 2. Against this order, the appellant filed an application under article226 of the Constitu\u00ad tion in the High Court for the issue of a writ of cer\u00ad tiorari. The application was heard by a single Judge whoissued the requisitewrit. Againsthis decision there wasa Letters Patent appeal by respondent No. 2,whichwas allowed and the decision of the single Judge was set aside. The groundupon which the Regional Transport Authority granted the appellant and respondent No. 2 permits for routes Nos.1 and 2 respectivelywas that they were experienced and were operating town buses at Kumbakonam. Thisopinionwas approved by the Board which also thought that a ~certain amount of healthy competitionwas required in the Mayurarn Town routes. It also considered that the Regional Transport Authority was within its rights in not considering the aspect of sectorcoverage by mu\u00ad ffassil buses of the appellant and respondent No. 2. It appears that respondent No. 2 wascovering the entire route No. 1 and the appellant wascoveringa portion of route No.'2. The State Governmentin setting aside the orders of the' Regional Transport Authority and the Board passed the' followingorder:. \"As between the claims of Sri Raman & Raman Ltd. and Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service, the Government consider that it will be in the interest of the public to grant both the permits to Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Ser\u00ad vic!ol, Poryar, sincehe has better facilities fcii- opera\u00ad tion and will be able to serve the public better. The Government of Madras thereforesets asideas impro\u00ad per the order of the Central Road Traffic Board No. R27792/A2/54 dated the 18th of August,1954 in so far as it confirms the order of the Regional Trans\u00ad port Authority, Tanjore granting one permit of route S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 259 No. 1 to Sri Raman & Raman Ltd. and directs that the two permits in questionbe granted to Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service, Poryar\". Before dealingwith the submissions made on be\u00ad half of the appellant, it:would be desirable to make reference to certainprovisions of the Act concerning . the grant of permits.Section 42 of the Act prohibits an owner of a transport vehicle fromusingor per\u00ad mitting it to beusedin any publicplace save in accordancewith the conditions of a permit granted by a Regional Transport Authority. Section 43 gives certain powers to the State Government to control road transport. Section 44authorises the State Gov\u00ad ernment to constitute a State Transport Authority as wellas a Regional Transport Authority to perform certain functionsmentionedtherein. Section 47 sets forth certain matters which a Regional Transport Authority shallbear in mind in deciding to grant or to refusea stagecarriagepermit.Section 64 enables a personaggrieved by the order of the Regional Transport Authority, with respect to matters men\u00ad tioned therein, to appeal to the prescribed authority. Section 64-A states: \"The State Governmentmay, of its own motion or on application made to it, call for the records of any orderpassed or proceeding taken under this Chapter by any authority or officersubor\u00ad dinate to it, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality, regularity or propriety of such order or proceeding and after examining such records, may pay pass suchorderin reference thereto as it thinks fit\". Mr. Pathak, for the appellant,contended that hav\u00ad ing regard to the terms of section64-A, there were two stagesfor the exercise of power thereunder by the State Government.The first stage was the condition precedentfor assumption of jurisdictionfor the exer\u00ad cise of that power.A collateral fact had to be decided, namely whether the orderpassed by any authority or officersubordinateto. the State Governmentwas in fact illegal, irregular or improper. If the decision was in the affirmative, then and then onlywould the State Government have jurisdiction to revise the 1956 Raman and RamanUd, v. The State of Madras and another ImamJ. 1966 Raman and RamanUd. v. The State of Madras and another Imam}. 260 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] order complained against. The decision of the State Government both with respect to questions of fact and law couldbe examined by a court in a proceed\u00ad ing for the issue of a writ of certiorari and such court in doingso coulddecide whether the order which was revised by the State Government was or was not illegal, irregular or improper. In the present case, there was no question of illegality or irregularity in the orders of the Regional Transport Authority and the Board.The onlyquestion was as to whether these orderswere improper.The propriety of an order does not necessarily mean that it must be correctorder. There must be something extraneous to the order it\u00ad self whichmade it improper.Merely because the State Government took a differentview of the facts to that of the authority or officer subordinate to it would not make the order of such authority or officer improper. The secondstage, namely, the passing of an order as the State Government thought fit, could onlybe reached after a decision had been arrived at on the condition precedentconferring jurisdiction on the State Govern\u00b5ient to revise an order. The sub\u00ad stantial ground upon which the State Government revised the order of the authority subordinate to it was that respondent No. 2 had better facilitiesfor operation and would, therefore,be able to serve the public better. The authorities subordinate to the State Government,however, had the representations of the appellant and respondent No. 2, as well as other applicants,which fully stated all material parti\u00ad culars in this respect and it could not be said that these matters were not considered by them. The orders of the subordinate authorities accordingly must be read to mean that as between the appellant and respondentNo. 2 both had equal facilitiesfor operation and that things being equal between them in every way, one permit shouldbe _granted for one route to the appellant and another for another route to respondent No. 2. There couldbe nothing impro\u00ad per in this. The condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to revise the order was therefore ab\u00ad sent \u00b7and the State Government actedin excess of its S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 261 jurisdiction in revising the orders of its subordinate authorities. Mr. Pathak further contended that there was an error on the face of the .record in the order passed by the State Government as it had refused to consider seniority or experiencein motor transport as a factor for the granting of a permit and it thought that it couldcome to any conclusion it liked and reference was made to paragraph 8 of the affidavitfiled on be\u00ad half of the State Government in the High Court.On the!basis of that affidavit and that paragraph, it was alsourged that the error on the face of the recordwas that the Government acted on an erroneousidea of its own jurisdiction. He further contended that section 64-A was an in\u00b7 validprovision. In the alternative, he urged that a court or autho\u00ad rity, in the exercise of its revisionalpowers, cannot take a contrary view of the facts to that taken by the subordinate court or authority. Exercise of such revisionalpower could only be made in caseswhere the subordinate court or authority had taken a per\u00ad verse view of the facts and had arrived at a conclu\u00ad sion whichno reasonableperson could have arrived at. In support of his firstcontention,Mr. Pathak relied upon paragraph 116 at page59 ofHalsbury's Laws of England, third edition, Vol. ll. It appears from an' examination of that paragraph and paragraph 117 at page 60 of the sameVolume that there may be cases where the jurisdiction of an inferior tribunal may dependupon the fulfilment of some condition prece\u00ad dent or upon the existence of some particular fact. Such a fact is collateral to the actual matter which the inferior tribunal has to try, and the determina\u00ad tion of whether it exists or not islogically and in sequenceprior to the determination of the actual question which the inferior tribunal has to try. In such a case, in certiorari proceedings,a court can enquire into the correctness of the decision of the inferior tribunal as to the collateral fact and may reverse that decision if it appears to it, on the 1956 Raman and Raman Ltd. v. The State o/ Madras anc. attother 1956 Ra,nanand Ra1nanLtd. v. The State of Madras and another Inia1nJ. 262 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] materials before it, to be erroneous. There may be tribunals, however,which, by virtue of legislation constituting them, have the powers to determine finally the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends. With respect to them, in such cases, their decisioneven if wrong on facts or law cannot be corrected by a writ of cer\u00ad tiorari. In caseswhere the fact in question is a part of the very issuewhich the inferior tribunal has to enquire into, a court will not issue a writ of certiorari, although the inferior tribunal may have arrived at an erroneous conclusion with regard to it. In the present case, if there was at all any collateral fact to be decided, it was whether the appropriate auth\u00ad ority had in fact passed any order in respect of which powers under section 64-Acouldbe exercised. It is not disputed that in fact orderswere passed by the Regional Transport Authority and the Board, auth\u00ad orities subordinate to the State Government, and that these orders existed when the appellant and respon\u00ad dent No. 2 moved that Government to exercise its powers under section64-A. The condition prece\u00ad dent and the existence of a collateral fact in that way for the exercise of powers under that section were therefore present when the State Government exercised its powers. In order to satisfy itself whe\u00ad ther the order of an authority subordinate to it was legal, regular or proper, the State Government was not deciding the existence of a collateral fact but the issue itself as to the legality, regularity or the pro\u00ad priety of the order. The satisfaction of the State Government in this respect wouldbe an expression of its opinion and not the determination of a fact upon which depended its jurisdiction to exercise its powers under section64-A. What is the nature of the functions performed under the Act by the Regional Transport Authority, the Board and the State Government in the matter of granting or refusing to grant a permit may now beconsidered. That they are not judicial is accepted, but, it is said, they are not administrative but quasi\u00ad judicial and therefore amenable to the jurisdiction of S.C.R. SUPREMECOURT REPORTS 263 a court possessing the power to issue a writ of certio\u00ad rari. In proceedings under sections4 7, 64 and 64-A of the Act there is no determination of any indivi\u00ad dual's rights and from that point of view the func\u00ad tions of these authorities may beregardedas execu\u00ad tive or administrative. On the other hand, it may be said that aperson has the fundamental right to carry onhisbusiness of plyingbuses and therefore has the right to have the statutory functions of these autho\u00ad rities properly exercised in whichcase they would bequasi-judicialfunctions. Assuming this to be so, it has yet to be seen whether the State Government acted in excess of its legal authority. Chapter IV of the Act contains provisionsconcerning the control of transport vehicles:\u00b7 The Act authorises the State Government to constitute a State Transport Autho\u00ad rity and Regional Transport Authorities, and under section 43, subject to its provisions, it can control road transport. In the firstinstance, the authority to grant or refuse to grant a permit is vested in the Regional'I'ransport Authority, but its order is not final as a dissatisfied party can appeal against the order under section 64 to the appropriate authority. Beforesection64-A was inserted into the Aqt by an Act of the legislature of the State of Madras, it might have beenpossible to contend that the order of a Regional Transport Authority which had not been appealed against and the order of the appropriate authority under section64, where an appeal had been made,were incapable of interference by the State Governmentfor lack of statutory authority. By enacting section 64-A, the legislatureclearly intended that that should not be so and that the State Gov\u00ad ernment should have the powers to intervene, if it wassatisfied that the orderin questionwas either illegal, irregular or improper. In clothing the State Government with suchpower th~ legislatureclearly intended the State Government to decide the issue as to whether any order in questionwas illegal, irregular or improper. It would not be open to a court exer\u00ad cising the power of certiorari to intervene merelybe\u00ad cause it might be of the opinion that the view taken 85 1956 Raman and Raman Ud. .... TheState of Madras and another lmamJ. 1956 Ranian and Raman Ud. v. The State of Madras and another Imam]~ 264 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) by the State Government was erroneous. The word \"propriety\" has nowherebeen defined in the Act and is capableof.a variety of meanings. In the Oxford English Dictionary (Vol. VIII), it has been stated to mean \"fitness; appmpriateness; aptitude \u00b7suitability; appropriateness to the circumstances or conditions; conformity with requil'.ement,rule or principle; rightness,correctness,justness, accuracy\". If the State Government was of the opinion that respondent No. 2 had better facilities for operation than the appellant and their service to the public would bemorebeneficial, it could not be said that the State Government was in error in think\u00ad ing that the order of the Board confirming the order of the Regional Transport Authority was improper. It is to be remembered that under section47 of the Act a Regional Transport Authority in de\u00ad ciding whether to grant or to refuse .a permit shall have regard, amongst other things, to the interest of the publicgenerally and the advantages to the public of the service to be provided.Assuming that in the matter of experience there was nothing much to choose between the appellant and respondent No. 2, better facilities for operation of the bus servicepos\u00ad sessed by respondent No.2, would be to the interest of.the public generally and an advantage to the public of the service to be provided and therefore was an overriding factor when other things wereequal.As between the appellant and respondent No.2 neither the Regional Transport Authority nor the Board re\u00ad corded a finding as to which of thetn had the better facilities for transport operation or that such faci\u00ad lities as existed between them were of equal merit. The State Government did not have,therefore, the advantage of knowing, on the face of the orders of these authorities, what view they took of this matter. Even if it is assumed that their orders meant that the facilitiesfor operation as between the appellant and respondent No. 2 were of equal merit, still the State Govenment was not in a position to know on what material this opinionwas based or that it was a reasonable view. In order to satisfy itself the State - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 265 Governmentexamined the materials available to it and came to the conclusion that respondentNo. 2 had the better facilities,in other words, it would be un\u00ad reasonable to hold that respondentNo. 2 had not the better facilities.The learnedsingle Judge of the High Courtmore than once held that he could- not find that therewas no material before the State Gov\u00ad ernment to justify its finding that respondentNo. 2 had the better facilities, and he further held that that was a factorwhichrestricted the jurisdiction of the High Court underarticle226 of the Constitution. That should have concluded the matter so faras the High Courtwas concerned.He, however, thought that it could not be said that the conclusionreached by the State Government was the only \u2022Conclusion possible and a meredisagreementon the conclusions to be drawnfrom the availablematerials, wher~ either view was a reasonableone, was not enough to establish that the orderspassed by the Boardand the Regional Transport Authoritywere improperwithin the meaning of section 64-A. The State Government had thereforeacted in excess of its jurisdiction. It seems to us, that the order of the State Government as it stands cannotbe said to be in excess of its juris\u00ad diction nor can .it besaid that in recordinga finding that respondentNo. 2 had the bet.terfacilitiesfor operation and wouldserve the publicbetter, it went beyond its powers, in the absence of afinding to the contrary by the authoritiessubordinate to it. The interests of the public and the advantages to it of the service to beprovidedwere very, if not the most, important factors to be taken into considerationin the matter of granting or refusing to grant a permit. In the conflictingclaims of the appellant and respon\u00ad dent No. 2 concerning the facilitiesavailable to them for operation of the busservice, the State Govern\u00ad ment was bound to decide,in the interests -of the public generally,which of these had the better faci\u00ad lities. It was within the scope of its authority to decide this and a court in certiorari proceedingsought not to interfere with that decision.To hold that the opinion of the Regional Transport Authority and the 1956 Raman and Raman Ud. v. TheState of Madras and another Imam}. 1956 Raman and RamanUd. v. The State of Madras and another Imam}. 266 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] Board that the facilities for operation were equal as between these persons was a reasonable viewwould be to constitute the court as the final authority in a matter, inwhich, by the provisions of the Act, that function wasaccorded to the State Government.We are aot prepared therefore to say that the State Gov\u00ad ernment acted in excess of its statutory authority. There is no error on the face of the record so far as the order of the State Government is concerned and reference to paragraph 8 of the State Government's affidavit in the High Court does not establish any such thing. That paragraph wasin answer to paragraphs 13 and 14; of the appellant's affidavit and it set out the contentions of the State Government as to fts powers.There is nothing in that paragraph to estab\u00ad lish that in fact the State Government had declined to considerseniority or experience in the matter of selection. No substantial ground was put forward for sup\u00ad posing that section64-A was an illegalprovision. It was within the competence of the State Legislature to insert section64-A into the Act. It was a reason\u00ad ableprovision in keeping with the entire scheme of the Act concerning transport vehicles and control of road transport. As to the extent of powers of revision in a court or authority we do not intend to expre.ss any opinion in this case having regard to the view we take that the order of the State Government cannot be interfered with by the issue of a writ of certiorari.. As regards the limits of judicialreview which the courts have under article 226 whichis one of the grounds on which the certificatewas issued by the High Court, that question has sincebeen considered in the various decisions of this Court, which do not .require recapitulation. In our opinion, tQ.is is not a case in which it would be reasonable to hold that the State Government acted in excess of its jurisdiction. The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs to be paid to res- pondent No. 2. \u00b7"

The Union SG 272 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 of India(') and ending with BudhanChowdhry and 8. \u00b7s others v. The State of Bihar( 0). In the last mentioned \u2022d\u2022 uJ>Ply Co. casea Full Bench of this court summarised the result The uni:;, of India of the earlierdecisionson this point in the words and others following:- \"It is nowwell-established that while article 14 Das O.J. forbidsclass legislation, it does not forbidreasonable classificationfor the purposes of legislation. In order, however, to pass the test of permissibleclassification two conditions must be fulfilled,namely, (1) that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentiawhich distinguishespersons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and (2) that that differentia must have a rational re\u00ad lation to the objectsought to be achieved by the statute in question. The classification may be founded ondifferentbases; namely,geographical, or according to objects or occupations or the like. What is neces\u00ad sary is that there must be a nexusbetween the basis of classification and the object of the Act under con\u00ad sideration. It is alsowell-established by the decisions of this court that article 14 condemnsdiscrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a law of procedure\". Wehave,therefore, to approach the problemposed beforeus bearing in mind the aboveprinciples laid down by this court in so far as they may be applicable to the facts of the present case. Turning now to the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922 we find that section64 makesprovisionfor deter\u00ad mining the place of assessment. By sub-section(1), where an assesseecarries on a business,profession or vocation at any place, he shall be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of that area in which that place is situate or where the business,profession, or vocation is carried on at more than one place by the Income\u00ad tax Officer of the area in which the principalplace of business, profession or vocation is situate. In all other cases, according to sub-section(2), an assessee shall be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of the area in in whichhe resides. If any questionarises as to the (1) [1950] 8.0.R. 869. (t) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1045, S.C.R.

It is quite and others clearfrom the aforesaidprovisions of section 64 that the Legislatureconsidered the question of the place of assessment to be of some importanceto the assessee. The provisions. of section 64 of the Indian Income- . tax .. Act,1922 c~tme up for discussionbefore the Bom\u00ad bay High Court in DayaldasKushiramv. Commis\u00ad sioner of Income-tax, Oentral(1). At pages 657 to 658 Beaumont, C.J. observedas follows: \"In myopinionsection 64 was intended to ensure that as far as practicable an assesseeshould be assessedlocally, and the area to which an Income\u00ad tax Officer is appointed must, so far as the exigencies of tax collectionallow, bear somereasonablerelation to the place where the assesseecarried on business or resides.There is noevidence that therewas any difficultyin restricting the area to which the Income\u00ad tax Officer, Section II (Central),was appointed to something much narrower than the Bombay Presi\u00ad dency, Sind and Baluchistan.Therefore, in my opinion, Income-taxOfficer, Section II (Central), is not the Income-tax Officer of the area in which the applicant's place of businessis situate, and as there issuch an officer in existence,namely, the Officer of Ward C, Section II, in my\u2022 opinion, it is only the latter officerwho can assess the assessee\". Kania, J. (as he then was)said at pages 660-661: \"A plainreading of the sectionshows that the same is imperativein terms. It alsogives to the assesseea valuable right. He is entitled to tell the taxing authorities that heshall not be calledupon to attend at differentplaces and thus upset his busi- ness\".\u00b7 It will be noticedfrom the above passages that the learned judges treated the provisions of section64 moreas a question of right than asa matter of con\u00ad venienceonly. It was for the abovedecision that the (1) I.L.R. [1940) Bom. 650; [1940] 8 I.T.R. 130.

It is thus clear from this amendment that the benefit conferredby the provisions ohub-section (1) and sub-. section (2) are taken away and is to bedeemed and not to haveexisted at any timeas regards the asses\u00ad seewithregard to whoma transfer order is made under sub-section ('7-A) of section5. In order, how\u00ad ever, to deprive a particular assessee of the benefits of sub-sections (I} and (2) of section 64, there must be a validorderundersection5(7-A) and he willlose the benefitonly to the extent to which that right is taken away by a validordermadeunder sub-section (7-A} of section 5. Thistakesus to the new sub- section(7-A) of section 5.. Sub-section(7-A) of section 5 runsas follows:\u00ad \"(7-A) The Commissioner of Income-taxmay , transfer any case from one Income-taxOfficer sub\u00ad ordinate to him to another, and the Central Board of Revenue may transfer any case from any one Income\u00ad tax Officer to another. Such transfer maybe made at any stage of the proceedings, and shall not render S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 275 necessary the reissue of any notice already issued by 1956 the Income-tax Officerfrom whom the case is trans- n\u00b7a\u00b7s .,,,,,1 c fe d\u00bb i I \"r,- ;JI O, rre . v. The sub-section in terms makesprovisionsfor the The Union of India transfer of a \"case\". Under the Indian Income-tax and others Act, 1922 a caseis started when the Income-tax Officer issuesa n,otiee undersection22(2) of the Act calling upon the assessee to file h~s return of his total income and total worldincome during the previous year and then the assesseesubmits his return in the prescribed form. It isquiteclearfrom the section that the notice and the return are to be confined to a parti- cular assessment year and the sub-sectioncontem- plates the transfer of such a \"case\", i.e., the assess- ment case for a particular year.The provision that sucha transfer may be made \"at any stage of the proceedings\"obviously postulatesproceedings actually pending and \"stage\" refers to a point in between the commencement and ending of thosepro- ceedings. Further the provision that such transfer shall not rendernecessary the reissue of notice al- ready issued by the Income-taxOfficer from whom the case is transferred quite clearlyindicates that the transfer contemplated by the sub-sectionis the trans- fer of a particular case actually pending before an Income-TaxOfficer of one placeto the Income-Tax Officer of another place. The fact that in this case the Income-tax Officer, SpecialCircle, Ranchi issued freshnoticeunder section22(2) quiteclearlyshows that he did not understand that any particular pend- ing case of this assessee had beentransferred to him. Evidently he thought that the assessment of the peti- tioner'sincome,generally and as a whole, had been transferred to him and that it was,therefore,for him to initiate a case,i.e.,assessmentproceedingsfor a particular year. In our judgment such an omnibus wholesaleorder of transfer is not contemplated by the sub-section. It is implicitin the sub-section that the Commissioner of Income-Tax or the Central Board of Revenue,as the case may be, shouldbefore making an order of transfer of any case apply hisor its mind to the necessity or desirability of the transfer Das C.J. 276 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 7956 of that particular case. The fact that it is necessary or desirable to transfer a case of assessment of a Bi.-li supply Co. 11 v. particu ar assessee for any particu ar year does not The Union of India necessarily indicate that it is equally\" necessary or \"''d others desirable to transfer another assessment case of that assesseefor any other assessment year. We are accord- Das C.J. ingly of the opinion that the impugned order of transfer, which was expressed in general terms with\u00ad out any reference to a.ny particular case and with\u00ad out any limitation as to time, was beyond the com\u00ad petence of the Central Board of Revenue. We did not understand the learned Attorney\u00b7Gerieral to con\u00ad tend that such was not the correct interpretation of the sub-section. We do not consider it necessary,for the purpose of this ca.se, to pause to consider whether the constitu\u00ad tionality of sub-section (7-A) of section 5 can be sup\u00ad ported on the principle of any reasonable classifica\u00ad tion laid down by this court or whether the Act lays down any principle for guiding or regulating the exercise of discretion by the Commissioner or Board of Revenue or whether the sub-section confers an unguided and arbitrary power on those authorities to pick and choose individual assessee and place that assessee at a disadvantage in comparison with other assessees. It is enough for the purpose of this case to say that the omnibus order made in this case is not contemplated or sanctioned by sub-section (7-A) and that, therefore, the petitioner is still en\u00ad titled to the benefit of the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 64.All assessees are entitled to the benefit of those provisions except where a particular case or cases of a particular assessee for a particular year or years is or are transferred under sub-section (7-A) of section 5, assuming that section to be valid and if a particular case or casesis or are transferred his right under section 64 still remains as regards his other case or cases.As said by Lord Atkin in EshugbaiEleko's case(') the executive can only act in pursuance of the powers given to it by law and it cannot interfere with the liberty, property ll) IJ.R. [1931) A.O. 6G2 1 670. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 277 and rights of the subject except on the condition that 1956 it can support the legality of its action before the Bidi suppzy co. court. Here there was no such order of transfer as v. is contemplated or sanctioned by sub-section (7-A) The Union of Tndia of section 5 and, therefore, the present assesseestill and others has the right, along with all other Bidi merchants carrying on business in Calcutta, to have his assess\u00ad ment proceedingsbefore the Income-tax Officer of the area in which his place of businessis situate. The income-tax authorities have by an executiveorder, unsupported by law, picked out this petitioner and transferred all hiscases by an omnibus order unlimited in point of time. This order is calculated to inflict considerableinconvenience and harassment on the petitioner. Its books of account will have to be pro\u00b7 ducedbefore the Income-tax Officer, SpecialCircle, Ranchi-a place hundreds of miles from Calcutta, whichis its place of business. Its partners or prin- cipal officerswill have to be away from the head office fora considerableperiod neglecting the main business of the firm.There may be no suitable placewhere they can put up during that period.There will certainly be extra expenditure to be incurred by it by way of railwayfare, freight and hotelexpenses. Therefore the reality of the discrimination cannot be gainsaid. In the circumstances this substantial dis- crimination has beeninflictedon the petitioner by an executivefiat whichis not founded on any law and no question of reasonableclassification for purposes of legislation can arise. Here \"the State\" which includes its Income-tax department has by an illegal orderdenied to the petitioner, as compared with other Bidi merchants who are similarly situate, equa- lity before the law or the equal protection of the laws and the petitioner can legitimatelycomplain of an infraction of his fun dam en tal right under article14 of the Constitution. It has further been urged that this orderindirectly affects the petitioner's fundamental right under article l9(I)(f) and article 31. There can beno gainsaying the fact that the order purports to deprive the petitioner of its right under section64 to which DasC.J. 278 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 1956 it would otherwisebe entitled. The order of transfer ..is certainly calculated to inflict considerableincon- 8'J' Supply Co. . dhtt th t\"t\" h. v vemence an arassmen oe pe 1 1oneras erem- r~. union.of India beforementioned. But in the view we have taken and others on the construction of sub-section(7-A) of section 5 Das C.J. and the petitioner's rights under article 14, it is not necessaryfor us, on this occasion, to express any opinion on the contention that the inconvenience and harassment referred to above constitute an imposi\u00ad tion of such an interferenceas amounts to an un\u00ad warranted restriction on the petitioner's rights under article 19(l)(g} or a violation of his rights under article31. For the reasons stated above this petition must be allowed.Accordingly the impugned order is set aside and an injunction is issuedin terms of prayer ( c) of the petition. The petitioner is entitled to the costs of this applicatio\";. BOSE J.-I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice that this petition should beallowed but fordifferent reasons. In my opinion,sections 5(7-A) and 64(5)(b) of the Indian Income-tax Act are themselves ultra vires article14 of the Constitution and not merely the order of the Central Board of Revenue. Theonlyquestionis whether these sections con\u00ad travene article 14. Despite the constant endeavour of Judges to define the limits of this law, I am unable to deduce any clear cut principlefrom the oft\u00ad repeated formula of classification.As I have said in another case, even the learned Judges who propound that theory and endeavour to work it out are driven to concede that classification in itself is not enough for the simple reason that anything can beclassified and every discriminatory action must of necessity fall into some category of classification,for classifica\u00ad tion is nothing more than dividing off one group of things from another; and unlesssome difference or distinction is made in a givencase no question under article14 canarise. It is just a question of framing a set of rules. It is elementary that no twothings are exactly SUPREME COURT REPORTS 279 alike and it is equallyobvious many things have features that are common. Once the lines of demar- 1956 Bidi Supply Co. cation are fixed, the resultant groupingis capable of v. objective determination but the fixing of thelinesis The Union of India necessarily arbitrary and to say that governments and others and legislatures may classifyis to invest them with anaked and arbitrary power to discriminateas they please. Faced with the inexorable logic of this position, the learned Judges who apply this test are forced to hedge it round with conditionswhich, to my mind, add nothing to the clarity of the law. I willpassover the limitationswith which the classification test is nowjudiciallysurrounded,namely that it must be \"reasonable'', it must not be \"discriminatory\" or \"arbitrary'', it must not b~ \"hostile\"; there must be no \"substantial discrimination\" and soforth, and will proceed at once to a rule that issupposed to set the matter at rest. The ruleis taken from the American decisions and was stated thus in TheState of West Bengal v. AnwarAli Sarl:ar(i); \"In order to pass the test, two conditions must be fulfilled,namely (1) that the classification must be foundedon an intelligibledifferentia which disting\u00ad uishesthose that are grouped together fromothers and (2) that that differentiamust have a rational relation to the objectsought to be achieved by the Act\". Mukherjea, J. (ashe then was)said at page 321 ibid that \"the classificationshould never be arbitrary, artificial or evasive. It must rest alwaysupon real and substantial distinctionbearing a reasonable and just relation. to the thing in respect to which the clas\u00ad sification is made; and classificationmade without any reasonable basis shouldbe regardedas invalid\". In another case, Ram Prasad Narayan Saki and Ano\u00ad ther v. The State of Bihar and Others( 9), the same learned Judge said at page 1139- \"but suchselection or differentiation must not be arbitrary and should rest upon a rational basis,having regard to the objectwhich the legislature has in view\".

(2) [1958) S.O.R. 1129. 37 Bose]. 280 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] t 1956 Ivor Jennings puts it another way: \"Among equals the law shall be equal and shall Bidi s\"!'ply co. be equally administered and that like shall be treated . l'k ,, The Union of India a. 1 e . a\"d others With the utmost respect all this seems to me to break dow\u00b7n ona precise analysis, for even among BoseJ. equals a large discretionis left to judges in the matter of punishment, and to the police and to the State whether to prosecute or not and to a host of officials whether to grant or withhold a permit or a licence. In the end, having talked learnedly round and around the article we are no wiser than when we started and in the end come back to its simple phrasing- \"The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India''. The truth is that it isimpossible to beprecise, for we are dealing with intangibles and though the re\u00ad sults are clear it isimpossible to pin the thought down to any precise analysis. Article14 sets out, to my mind, an attitude of mind, a way of life; rather than a preciserule of law. It embodiesa general awareness in the consciousness of the people at large of something that ,exists and which is very real but which cannot be pinned down to any precise analysis of fact save to say in a given case that it falls this side of the line or that, and because of that decisions on the same point will vary as conditions vary, one conclusion in one part of the country and another somewhereelse; one decision today and another to\u00ad morrow when the basis\u00b7 of society has altered and the structure of current social thinking is different. It is not the law that alters but the changing conditions of the times and article 14 narrows down to a ques\u00ad tion of fact which must be determined by the highest Judges in the land as each casearises. (See on this point Lord Sumner's line of reasoning in Bowman's case(')). Always there is in thesecases a clash of con\u00ad flictingclaims and it is the core of the judicialprocess to arrive at an accommodation between them. Any\u00ad body can decide a question if only a single principle (1)[1917] A.C. 406,466, 467. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 281 is in issue. The heart of the difficultyis that there 1956 is hardly any question that comes before the Courts Bidi suppty co. that does not entail more than one so-calledprinciple. v. As Judge Leonard Hand of the United States Court The Union of India of Appeals said of the American Constitution- and others \"The words a judge must construeare empty vessels into which he canpour anything he will\". Theserules are usefulguides in some cases but they do not, in my opinion,go to the root of the matter; nor am I alone in sothinkingthough my approachis moredirect and fundamental than is usual. Patanjali Sastri,C.J. said in The State of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali Sarlcar(1) that the reporteddecisions \"underline the futility of wordyformulation of so-called 'tests' in solvingproblemspresented by con\u00ad crete cases\". I endeavoured to point out in my judgmentin Anwar Ali Sarlcar's case(1) at page 361 that one can conceive of classifications that conform to allthese rules and yet whichare bad:classificationsmade in the utmost good faith;classifications that are scienti\u00ad fic and rational, that will havedirect and reasonable relation to the objectsought to be achieved and yet whichare badbecausedespite all that the object itself cannot beallowedon the ground that it offends article14. In such a case, the object itself must be struck down and not the mereclassificationwhich, after all, is onlya means of attaining the enddesired; and that, in my judgment,is precisely the point here. It is the very point that Fazl Ali J. made in Anwar Ali Sarkar's case(1) at pages 309-310: . \"It wassuggested that the reply to this query is that the Actitselfbeinggeneral and applicableto allpersons and to all offences, cannot be said to dis\u00ad criminate in favour of or against any particular case orclasses of persons or cases, and if any charge of discriminationcan be levelled at all, it canbe levelled onlyagainst the act of the executive authority if the Act is misused.This kind of argumenthowever does not appear to me to solve the difficulty.The result of accepting it wouldbe that even wherediscrimina- (1) [1952) S.C.R.284, 297. Bose J. 282 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1955 tion is quite evident one cannot challenge the Act Bidi supply co. simplybecause it is couched in generalterms; and one v. canndt also challenge the act of the executive auth- Th\u2022 Union of In4ia ority whose duty it is t\u00b7o administer th~ Act, becallSe andothm that authority will say:-! am not to blame as I am Bos\u2022J. acting under the Act. It is clear that if the argument were to be accepted,article I 4 could be easily de\u00ad feated.I think the fallacy of the' argument lies in overlooking the fact that the 'insidious piscrimina\u00ad tion complained of is incorporated in the Act itself', it beingso drafted that whenever any discrimination is made suchdiscriminationwould be ultimately traceable to it\". Nor, in the past, has this Court hesitated to strike down the Act or Order itself when it confers un\u00ad restrictedpower as here .. That was what. happened in the Coal Control Case('); the Order itself was struck down and not the executiveaction taken by virtue of the unrestricted powers conferred l:iy that law. See page813 where it was said- \"The Order commits to the unrestrained will of a singleindividual the power to grant, withhold or cancellicences in any way he chooses. and there is nothing in the Order whichwouldensurea proper execution of the power or operate as a check upon iiijustice that mightresult from improper execution of the same\". So also in the State of Madras v. V. G. Row(\"). It is true that thesewerecases under article 19 and not 14 of the Constitution but the principleis the same. Ineed not multiply instances. What is the positionhere? Here.is an Act that fixes a certain venuefor assessment in section64. That is the normal law of the land for these purposes. The language in sub-sections (I) and (2) is manda\u00ad tory: \"he shaU be assessed\". If there is doubt or dispute about the correctvenue, it can only be de\u00ad cided after hearingthe party concerned. Then come the provisions for transfer. Now it is,I think, necessary that there shouldbe powers of transfer and the mereconferral of such (1) [195'] s.c.B. 803.. (2) [1962] S.C.B. 697. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 283 powers would not offend article14. But, put at its 1 956 lowest, it isanomalous that whensimilarpowers are Bidi SttJ>Ply co. conferredon the High Courts and even on this Court v. under,for example, the Code of CriminalProcedure, The Union of India they should be hedgedround with limitations,where- and others as, when it comes to a Commissioner of Income-tax - or the Central Board of Revenue,no limitations BoseJ. whatever are placedupon them.Section526 of the Cri- minal Procedure Code confersonly limitedpowers of transfer on the High Court and article 136 empowers this Court to interveneshould those powersbe ex- ceeded by the High Court and should this Cou~t in its discretionfeel thatthat has led, or is likely to lead,to hardship and injustice or to a miscarriage of justice; and in the case of this Court a right to trans- feris conferredunder section527 onlywhen that is \"expedient in the interests of justice\". Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code is wider but that wasa law madebefore the Constitutionand, in any case, suc.h an orderwouldbe open to review by this Court and in a suitablecase, should the High Court act arbi- trarily or alongnon-judiciallines, such as directinga transfer without recordingreasons and without hear- ing the partiesconcernedwhen it is possibleto afford thema hearing, the matter wouldbe set right here. Thereis a big differencebetween investinga judicial authority withsuchpowers and other non-judicial bodiesbecausejudges must act in accordancewith a recognisedprocedure and obey the laws of natural justice unless there is express indication to the con- trary in the .statute. What is the positionhere? Thereis nohearing,no reasonsare recorded: just peremptoryorders trans\u00ad ferring the case fromone placeto another without any warning; and the powergiven by the Act is to transfer from one end of India to the other;nor is that powerunused.We havebeforeus in this Court a casepending in whicha transfer has beenordered from Calcutta in WestBengalto Ambala in the Pun\u00ad jab. Afterall, for whosebenefitwas the Constitution enacted? What was the point of makingall this 284 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 7956 pother about fundamental rights? I am clear that the 8.d. 5 /Pl Co Constitution is not fc~ the exclusivebenefit of gov- '' :. Y \u2022 ernments and States; it is not only for lawyers and The Union of India politicians and officials and those highlyplaced. It and others also exists for the common man, for the poor and\u00b7 the humble, for those who have businesses at stake, for Bose]. the \"butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker\". It lays down for this land \"a rule of law\" as under\u00ad stood in the free democracies of the world. It con\u00ad stitutes India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and guarantees in every page rights and freedom to the individual side by side and consistent with the overridingpower of the State to act for the common good of all. I make noapologyfor turning to older democracies and drawing inspiration from them, for though our law is an amalgam drawn from many sources, its firmest foundations are rooted in the freedoms of other lands where men are free in the democratic sense of the term. England has no fundamental rights as such and its Parliament is supreme but the liberty \u2022 of the subject is guarded there asjealously as the supremacy of Parliament. The heart and core of a democracylies in the judi\u00ad cialprocess, and that means independent and fear\u00ad less judges fre~ fromexecutive control brought up in judicial traditions and trained to judicial ways of working and thinking. The main bulwarks of liberty and freedomlie there and it is clear to me that un\u00ad controlledpowers of discrimination in matters that seriously affect the lives and properties of people cannot be left to executive or quasi executivebodies even if they exercisequasi judicial functions because they are then invested with.an authority that even Parliament does not possess. Under the Constitution, Acts of Parliament are subject to judicialreview particularly when they are said to infringe funda\u00ad men ta! rights, therefore, if under the Constitution Parliament itself has not uncontrolled freedom of action, it is evident that it cannot invest lesser authorities with that power. If the legislature itself had done here what the Cent~al Board of Revenue I - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 285 has done and had passed an Act in the bald terms of 1956 the o.rder m~de here transferring. the . case. of ~his Bidi supply co. petitioner, pwked out from others m a hke s1tuat10n, v. fromone State to another, or from one end of India The Union of India to the other, without specifying any object and with- and others out giving any reason, it would, in my judgment, have been bad.I am unable to see how the position is bettered because the Central Board of Revenue has done this a~d not Parliament. I quote Mukherjea J. (ashe then was) in a case whichis not in point here but in a passagewhose languageseems apt to the present position. The quot:ttion is from Ram PrasadNarayan Sahi v. The State of Bihar(1): \"It is impossible to conceive of a worseform of discrimination than the one whichdifferentiatesa particular individual from all hisfellowsubjects and visits him with a disabilitywhich is not imposed upon anybody else and against which even the right of complaintis taken away\" and again, \"It is true that the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment and it has to bepresumed that a Legislature understands and correctlyappreciates the needs of its own people. But when on the face of a statute there is noclassi\u00ad fication at all, and no attempt has beenmade to select any individual or group with reference to any differentiating attribute peculiar to that individual or group and not possessed by others, this presump\u00ad tion is of little or no assistance\". In the case of Liversidgev. Sir John Anderson( 2 ) the learned Law Lordswere at great pains to see whether the British Parliament had in fact left the matter under consideration there to the subjectivesatisfac\u00ad tion of a Secretary of State. 'fhere was no doubt that the British Parliament coulddo sobecause it is supreme and its action is not fettered by a written constitution; but the encroachment on the liberty of the subjectwas so great that the House of Lords was reluctant to reach the conclusionwhich it ulti- (1) [1953] S.C.R. 1129, 1143. (2) [1942] A.C. 20G. Bose J. 286 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 mately did by a majority, that that had in fact been done; and one of the learned Law Lords, Lord Atkin, Bidi S\"pply Co. Q v. read a powerfuldissentingopinion.ne of his criti- Th\u2022 Union of India cisms at page 226 was that the order of detention and others wasmade \"by an executive minister and not by any kind BoseJ. of judicialofficer; it is not made after any inquiry as to facts to which the subject is part~ it cannot be reversed on any appeal............ It is an absolute power which,so far as I know, has never beengivenbefore to the executive\". In my opinion, that is the very point here. In England the power can be conferred but, because it so vitally affects the liberty of the subject, the judges there fight against any interpretation that would lead to that conclusion and in the end reach it only when compelled to do soforoverwhelmingreasons. In India the fundamental freedoms conferred by the Constitution are guarded with equally \u00b7 jealous care and it seems to me that the whole point of having this Chapter on Fundamental Rights is to ensure that the .very things that the English judges fight against in their courts will not happen here. Io England the task of the judges is to see whether their Parliament has conferred those wide powers; in India our task is to see whether the Constitution has done so. In England the conferral of thosepowers isneverconcededunless Parliament uses clear, ex\u00ad press and unambiguouswords. In our EJonstitution I find an absence of any such clarity; on the contrary, the whole trend of the Constitution points the other way.. If an executive authority or a quasi judicial body, or even Parliament itself,were to be given the right to determine these matters to their subjective satis\u00ad faction, there wouldbe no point in these fundamental rights, for the courts would then bepowerless to in\u00ad terfere and determine whether those rights have been infringed. The whole point of the chapter is to place a limitation on the powers of all these bodies, includ\u00ad ing Parliament, save in its constituent capacity. Therefore, no power resting on the subjective satis- I S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 287 faction of any of these bodiescan everbe conferred; the satisfaction must alwaysbe objective in the sense 1956 Bidi Supply Co. in whichLord Atkinexplainedso that its exercise is v. open to judicial review. The Union of India In my opinion, the power of transfer can .only be and others conferred if it is hedgedround with reasonable restric\u00ad tions, the absence or existence of which can in the last instancebe determined by the courts; and the exercise of the power must be in conformitywith the rules of natural justice, that is to say, the parties affected must beheardwhen that is reasonablypos- sible, and the reasonsfor the order must be reduced, howeverbriefly, to writing so that men mayknow that the powersconferredon thesequasijudicial bodiesare beingjustly and properlyexercised. In a democracyfunctioningunder the Rule of Law it is not enough to dojustice or to do the right thing; justice must beseento bedone and a satisfaction and sense of securityengendered in the minds of the people at large in place of a vagueuneasiness that Star Chambers are arising in this land. We have received a richheritagefrom a veryvariegated past. But it is a treasurewhich can onlybe kept at the cost of ceaseless and watchfulguarding.There is no roomfor complacency,for in the absence of con\u00ad stant vigilance we run the risk of, losing it. \"It can happen here.\" I wouldhold for thesereasons, and in particular for the reasongiven: by Fazl Ali J. in the passage fromone of his judgmentsquoted above, that section 5(7-A) is ultra vires article 14 of the Con\u00ad stitution and so is ,section 64(5)(b) in so far as it makes an order undersection5(7-A) as it now exists, inviolate. I wouldallow the petition. Bose J."

The Judgment of the Court was deliveredby BosE J.-Four personswere killed about ll p.m. on the night of the 21st July 1951 and a number of others injured.This was said to be the result of a riot that occurred in the villageDhankoli. Thirty six personswere committedfor trial. Of these,two diedduring the course of the proceedings.The re\u00ad mainderwere all chargedunder section325/149 of the Indian Penal Code and eleven were also charged undersection302/149. Thelearned Sessions Judge acquitted twenty five of the chargeunder section325/149 and convicted nine.He acquittedall the eleven who werecharged undersection302/149 but convictednine of them under section325/149. The State did not appeal against the acquittals of the twenty five undersection325/149nor did it appeal against the acquittals of two of the eleven whowerechargedunder section 302/149 but it appealed against the acquittals of the remainingnine who had beenconvictedunder section325/149.These nineconvictsalso appealed.The High Court there\u00ad fore had two appealsbefore it, one against the acquittals of nine personsunder section302/149 and the other by the same persons against their convic\u00ad tionsundersection325/149. TheHigh Court dismissed the appeal of the convicts and allowed that of the State. The convictions of thesenine personswere accordinglyaltered to ones undersection302/149 of the Indian Penal Code and the lesser sentence of transportation was given to each. It is admitted on both sides that there wasbad 1956 Sukha and others v. The State of Rajasthan 1956 Sukha and others v. The State of Rajasthan Bose}. 290 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) blood in the village Dhankoli betweena caste known asBaorieson oneside and three other castes of the villagenamely, Jats, Dhobis and Khaties on the other. Thecasefor the prosecutionis that this was due to a dispute over a field that belonged to some of the Jats. Therewere some court proceedings about the field in which ParS!ia (one of the Baorieswho was killed) had appeared against the Jats. The accused Sukha, Gumana, Begla and Govindawere in parti\u00ad cular interested in this field and so borea grudge against Parsia. Thedefencealso allege enmity. Their caseis that the enmity is due to the fact that the villagersdecided not to employ the Baories for watch and ward work in the village as they suspected that the Baorieswere responsiblefor certain thefts that had occurred there. The other castes in the village thereforedid this work themselves by turns. Thiswas resented by the Baories and the allegationis that the Baories were responsible for the fight and attacked some of the others in the village and that that led to afight; but none of the appellants wasconcerned with it. From this point it willbe convenient to divide the narrative into a series of numbered steps. I. On the day in question, two of the Baories, Chhotiya and Parsia, had been to. aneighbouring village to bid at an auction where the field,which according to the prosecutionengendered the dispute, was beingsold. They returned to their village about 11 p.m. and ran into the accused Sukha and Gumana (both Jats). They were challenged\u00b7 and when they disclosedwho they were, Sukha and Gumana cried out \"kill them. They had gone for the auction of the field.\"On that Sukha fired a gun whichhe had with him and hit Parsia on the legs. Parsia fell down and Gumana hit him over the head with a sword. He also hit Chhotiya over the head with a sword and Chhotiya alsofell down. 2. Parsia and Chhotiya at oncecried out for help and their cries,coupled with the sound of the gun fire, brought a number of persons to the scene. The -' S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 291 number varies widely. Chhotia (P.W. 8) says 30 to 35, Ruga (P.W. 1) says 50 or 60, Bedu (P.W. 2) puts it at 30 or 40 and so does Lachhuri (P.W. 10), while Ladia (P.W. 11) thinks therewere as many as 100 to 150. There are other estimates too, mostlyin the neighbourhood of 30 to 40, but the exact number does not matter because it is evident that a crowd assembled.Those who did the attacking are said to have been about 30 or 40 but it is clearlyproved that severalBaorieswere there and that some of them were assaulted. The point of stressing these factsis to bring out the fact that most of the persons there did not as\u00ad semblefor an unlawfulpurpose and so did not form an unlawfulassembly.The problemis to\" sort out those who formed an unlawfulassemblyfrom those who did not. Mr. Sethi argued that there isno evi\u00ad dence to support a finding that there was an unlaw\u00ad fulassemblybecause it is impossible to determine whocame to attack and whodid not. But we will deal with this later. For the present, we will conti~ nue our narrative outlining the prosecutioncase. 3.After the gun wasfired and Parsia and Chhotiya struck down,a largenumber of persons rushed to the scene and, amongthem, some 30 or 40 were armed with variouskinds of weapons. Of these, Kamla, Balia, Todia and Bhawana (all Jats) had pharsies, Gumana, GovindaandJodhiya (alsoJats) had swords and the rest (Jats, Dhobis and Khaties) had lathis. Thesepersonsalso attacked Chhotiya and Parsia. 4. The cries of Chhotiya and Parsia attracted Mana,Govinda,Pemla, Ram buxa and Gangli and some others.These personsare Baories.This crowd of 30 or 40 turned on Mana and Govinda and attacked them. Sukha then firedhis gun a secondtime and hit Mana on his left hand. 5. In the meanwhile,Ganesh and his wifeSeruri (Baories)arrived and said \"don't beat, don't beat\". Sukha and Gumana said that they should also be beaten and thereupon these 30 or 40 persons.started to beat them too and they fell down. 6. Afterthis, Parsia's wife Lachhuri came there 1956 Sukh a and others v. The State of Rajasthan Bose]. 1946 Sukha and othef's v. The State of Rajaslhan Bose J. 292 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) and some 10 or 11 persons out of the original 30 or40 started to chase her. But she ran away and managed to escape with only a slight beating. 7. While this was happening, the five Baorieswho had been felled to the ground (Parsia, Ganesh, Mana, Govinda and Seruri) started to cry out. The ten or elevenwho had chased Lachhuri came back and on hearing the cries of these five on the ground, Sukha and Gumana said that they were crying and should be killed outright. On that these eleven persons divided into three groups and attacked the five on the ground as follows: \u00b7 Parsia was beaten by Sukha (with a pharsi), Jeewana (dangri) and Chokla (dangri). Manaand Govinda were beaten by Gumana (sword), Balia (pharsi) and Jankiya and Naraina (lathis). Ganesh was beaten by Bhawana (dangri), Govinda. (sword), Kumla (pha.rsi) and Begla.(dangri). Allfourdiedon the spot. The accusedwere charged as follows. One group consisting of 25 persons were charged under section 325/149 of the Indian Penal Code for intentionally beating, along with the other accused, 1. Chhotiya. 2. Seruri 3. Parsia 4. Mana 5. Govinda and 6. Ganesh. At a later stage, the following sentence was added to the charge: \"which you inflicted as a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of its common intention\". These twenty fivewere acquitted and we a.re not con\u00ad cerned with them except to note that they were not concerned with that part of the occurrence which we have set out as steps 6 and 7 above. The charge against the remaining eleven can be divided into two parts. Under the first, each, except Sukha, is charged with beating the Baories Parsia, Mana, Govinda, Ganesh, Chhotiya, Seruri, etc. \"a.long with other accused\". Five of the eleven are said to S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 293 have beaten them with \"swords and lathis\"; another five \"with lathis, etc.\" while the eleventh, Sukha, is said to have fired at Parsia and Mana \"as a result of which they fell down\". Then each charge continues- \" and when all had fallendown as a result of these injuries\". After that the chargesdivide off into three groups: One group charges (1) Gumana, (2) Naraina, (3) Balia and (4) Jankiya with beating Govinda and Mana, \"who were groaning, with lathis with intent to kill them till they were actually killed\". The next group charges (1) Jeewana, (2) Sukha and (3) Chokhla with hitting Parsia with lathi blows \"with intent to murder him till he died\". The third groupcharges (1) Begla, (2) Govinda,(3) Kumla and (4) Bhawana with as\u00ad saulting Ganesh with lathis with intent to murder till he died. The followingsentence was also added in the end of each of these charges: \"And you did this as a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of its common intention\". There has beensomeconfusion in both the Sessions Court and the High Court between \"common inten\u00ad tion\" and \"commonobject\". It is true the two some\u00ad timesoverlap but they are used in differentsenses in law and shouldbe kept distinct. In a case of unlaw\u00ad fulassemblyor riot we are concerned with a common object.However,we are satisfied that that has not caused any prejudice. But the reason why we have set out thesecharges at some length is becausecoun\u00ad selfor the appellants argued that the prosecution caseis that there weretwo separate assemblies,one of twenty five persons to beat six specificpersons and another of eleven to kill them in three groups. He argued that the twenty five who constituted the first assembly have allbeen acquitted; that the only material fromwhich an unlawfulassemblycan be inferred in the other caseis the instigation of Sukha and Gumana for a secondtime after they had returned from chasingLachhuri. That story, he said, has been disbelieved,so all must be acquitted. It willbe necessary at this stage to set out the 1956 Sukha and othef's v. The State of Rajasthan Bose/. 294 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 findings of the two lower courts. The learned Ses- -sions Judge starts by rejecting the evidence of Ruga Sukhaandothers (P.W. 1), Bodu (P.W. 2) and Bhagwatia (P.W. 3) on The s~:te of the question of identification of any of the accused Rajasthan and the evidence of Arjun (P.W. 4) about the con\u00ad spiracy to beat up the Baories. But he finds that the Bose J. evidence of the Baori witnesses, Chhotiya (P.W. 8), Lachhuri (P.W.10), Ladia (P.W. 11), Seruri (P.W. 12), Gangli (P.W. 13) and Pemla (P.W.14) is consis\u00ad tent \"so far as these 11 accused are concerned regard\u00ad ing their beating 4 persons to death and causing in\u00ad juries to Lachhuri, Ganesh's wife, Seruri and Cbbotiya\". Later, be states-\"From the evidence of these Baori witnesses,............... .it is found that these eleven accusedwere involved in the beating of the injured persons. Whether they formed part of a bigger assemblyis not now material because I have already discussed the cases of other accused and given them benefit of doubt. These elevenaccusedeven amongst themselvesbeing more than five in number could be regarded as members of an unlawful assembly\". But the learned Judge only accepted this story in part. HebelievedCbbotiya (P.W.8), Seruri (P.W. 12), Gangli (P.W. 13) and Pemla (P.W. 14) in so far as they stated that Sukba bad a gun and that Sukba used it against Parsia and Mana, but be did not ac\u00ad cept the evidence of Chbotiya (P.W. 8) in so far as he said that Gumana hit Chbotiya with a sword. He also rejected the prosecution version that the inci\u00ad dents occurred in two parts, first with abigger assembly that beat all the accused and next with a smaller one that ran after Lachhuri and beat her and then returned to beat the others to death at the insti\u00ad gat.ion of Sukha and Gumana. On this part of the case, the learned Sessions Judge found that \"whatever beating wasdonewas done immedi\u00ad ately after the scuffle between Cbhotiya and Parsia and Sukha and Gumana and Gumana and Naraina, and those accused who had arrived on the spot. Nobodyinstigated anybody\". (Para 103). It was argued on behalf of the defence that the learned Sessions Judge discarded the evidence about - - S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 295 instigation in toto. Counsel for the State, however, contended that this passagerefers to the second instigation which is said to havebeen given after the eleven had chased and beaten Lachhuri and returned to finishoff the others who werelying on the ground. We think that is right. In paragraph 101 of his judgment the learned Ses\u00ad sions Judge set out the fact that the prosecution witnessesdivide the incidents into two parts: one in which a larger assembly beat all the injured persons and the other in which elevenkilled the four deceased persons at the instigation of Sukha and Gumana. In paragraph 102 he set out reasonswhy he was not able to believe this story. The firstwasbecause \"Ladia (P.W.11) did not state in his statement before the police that after beating Lachhuri, when ten or elevenpersons had returned then at the insti\u00ad gation of Sukha and Gumana the injured were again beaten to death\". Then, after setting out four more rea::;ons, the learned Judge reached the conclusion just enumerated in paragraph 103. In paragraph 117 he said- \"Leaving Begla and Govinda,I am fully con\u00ad vinced that Sukha, Gumana, Naraina, Kumla, Balia, Jeewana, Chokhla, Bhawana Khati and Jankiya did commit rioting with the commonobject of beating the Baories\". In paragraph 118 he said- \"I am not convinced that the intention of all these accusedwas to murder the whole lot of Baories ............ \" In para 119-\"The accuseddid givesound beating to the injured\". He concluded that no commonobject to kill could be deduced but held that a commonobject to beat was olear. As he was unable to determine which accusedgave the fatal blows he convicted all under section302 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code. We think it is clear fromthis judgment, read as a whole, that the learnedSessions Judge disbelieved 30 1956 Sukha and others v. The State of Rajasthat1 Bose j. 1956 Sukha and others v. The State of l?.ajastliau Bose J, 296 SUPREMECOURT REPORTS [1956) the story of instigation at any stage because if he had believed even the first instigation, a common object to killwould have emerged. We are unfortunately not able to obtain much assi.stancefrom the judgment of the learned High Court Judges. They have not analysed the evidence and have not reached clear findings about a common object due in somemeasure to the fact that they d~ not appear to have appreciated the difference bet\u00ad weena commonobject and a common intention. They hold that six witnesses can berelied on to the extent that \"the villagerswere armed with guns, swords, farsies and lathis\". They do not believe all that these witnesses say because they hold \"Though, therefore,we do not believe that these eleven persons deliberately murdered the four injured Baories who werelying there saying that they should bekilled, there is no doubt in our minds that these elevenpersons.who have all been mentioned by these six witnesseswere certainly seen taking more active part in this incident\". Then they hold- . \"We are, therefore,satisfied on the statements of these witnesses that the incident took place in the main as stated by them and that the prosecution has given the right version of the affair\". Next, they hold that the fact that a large number of villagers,including the nine appellants, turned up armed with various weapons immediately they heard the quarrel between Chhotiya and Parsia on the one aide and Gumana on the other \"shows that there must have beensome consulta\u00ad tion frombefore and that these persons arrived in prosecution of the common ubject ............ \". And they add this reason: \"There is also the evidence o.f the prosecution witnesses that as the Baoriescame, some one or the other of these accusedincited the rest of the villagers to beat up the Baories\". From this they conclude that there was an unlawful assembly with the commonobject of beating up the Baories. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 297 This is veryunsatisfactory.The learnedJudges weredealing with an appealagainst an acquittal and though they haveallowed the appeal they liave not been specific about which part of the evidence they rely on in support of theirfindings,nor do theircon\u00ad clusionsfollow logicallyfrom the premiseson which they arebased. Take,for example, the finding about prior con\u00ad sultation. In the firstplace,no priorconsultationis requiredwhen a commonobject is in question.The essence of the distinctionbetween commonobject and common intentionlies there. In the next place, the six witnesses,who are relied on,say that a crowd of 30 or 40 personsassembled.Among that crowd were Baoriesbecausethree Baories(other than Parsia and Chhotiya)were killed and othersinjured. It is also evident that some of theseBaories must have had some sort of weaponsbecause three of the accused had slight injurieson their p~rson and onea fracture. \u00b7 The evidencediscloses that there had been thefts in the village.The uproaroccurred at 11 in the night. In those circumstances, it wouldbe natural for the villagers to rush to the scene and arm themselves with whatevercame to hand. Some may havebeen motivated by an unlawfulmotive but many would not, and to deducea common intention with prior concert in suchcircumstancesis impossible.A com\u00ad monobjectis different and courts of fa.ctare entitled to concludeon the evidence that has beenaccepted that some of those who rushed to the scenewent there with the object of beatingup personswhom they thought to be thieves and not merely to apprehend them or defend their properties;in other words, that some of those personsindividuallyhad an unlawful object in view. If each had the sameobject, then their 9bject wouldbe common and if therewere five or more with this object, then theywouldform an un\u00ad lawfulassemblywithout any prior concert among themselves. Next, take the HighCourt'sfinding about incite\u00ad ment. They haverejected the versiongiven by the prosecutionwjtnesses because they hold that the 1956 Sukha and oti1ers v. The State of\u2022 Rajasthan Bose}. 1956 Sukha and others \u2022\u2022 The State of Rajasthan Bo1eJ. 298 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] story about the second beating is an improvement and also because they disbelieve the evidence that in\u00ad dicates that theseelevenpersons deliberately murdered the four injured Baories. But the only evidence about incitement is that Sukha and Gumana called on the-others to kill Barsia, and later to kill the others.The incitement was quite clearly to kill and not merely to beat. If this is re\u00ad jected, then there is noevidence about incitement, so we are leftin the dark to know what the learned Judges based their conclusionon. That has left us with the task of finding whether there is, or could be, any proper basis for theseconvictions. Now, as we understand the learned Sessions Judge, he has believed the first part of the story whichwe have set out as step No. 1 except the portion that speaks about an incitement to kill. He finds that there was the meetingbetween Sukha\u00b7 and Gumana \u00b7 on the one side and Parsi a and Chhotiya on the other. He says- \"lt can safelybe deducedfrom the incidents as related by th!l witnesses in this case that in the beginning the fighting was betweena couple of persons only and on hearing their cries their relatives, friends and relations and othervillagers reached the spot and some of the villagers did beat the Baories\". Pausing there, it is evident that there was no un\u00ad lawful assemblywhen the beating started; nor can it be deduced that all the personswho rushed to the scene, whether the number was 30 or 150, formed an unlaw\u00ad ful assembly.We therefore have to scan the evidence carefully to see what happened after that. The find\u00ad ing is that the elevenaccusedwho were charged for the murder were all involved in the beating of the injured persons. That satisfiesone of the ingredients of riot\u00ad ing, namely the presence of five or more person.a. But that of courseis not enough. There must, in addition, be an \"assembly\" and that assembly must have a \"common object\" and the object must be \"unlaw\u00ad ful\". But a commonobject is differentfrom a common intention in that it does not require prior concert and S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 299 a commonmeeting of minds before the attack, and an unlawfulobject can develop after the peopleget there. It is not forus to re-assess the evidence in specialleave.All we can say is tha.t thereare cir\u00ad cumstances fromwhich courts of fact could deduce that an unlawfulobject developedwith more than five to share it once the marpit had started; and as two courts of fact a.re satisfied that it did,thereis no rea\u00ad sonfor us to interfere. Persons who had comethere quitelawfully, in the first instance,thinking there werethievescould well have developed an intention to beat up the \"thieves\" instead of helping to appre\u00ad hend them or defend their properties; and if five or more shared the object and joined in the beating, then the object of eachwouldbecome the common object.Thisis not to say that all thosepresentwere mem\u00ad bers of that assembly.The presumption of innocence wouldprecludesuch a conclusion.Those who rushed to the scene in the circumstancesdisclosed must be presumed to havegone therefor a lawfulpurpose even if they werearmed. The apprehension of ma\u00ad rauderswho prowl the town at night and the defence of person and propertyare lawfulobjects. But when that object is exceeded and personsbegin to beat up the suspects the a.ct of beating becomesunlawful,for priva.t.epersonsare no moreentitled to beat and ill\u00ad trea.t thieves than a.re the police,especially at a time when there isnothingbeyond suspicionagainst them. But if five or more exceed the originallawful object and ea.ch has the same unlawful intention in mind and they act together and join in the beating, then they in themselvesform an unlawful assembly.There is nodifference in principlebetween this and a case in which the original object was unlawful.The only differenceis that a case like this is moredifficult to establish and must be scrutinisedwith greater care. But that scrutiny is here and we aresatisfied that there is evidence in this case on whichcourts of fact could base the conclusion that they have reached. Now, did theseelevenpersons constitute an as\u00ad sembly or were they there individually without any 1956 Sukha and others v. The State of Raja\u2022than Bose]. 795G Sukha and others v. The State of Rajastlian Bose J, 300 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] common factor to link them together? That, we think, iseasilyanswered. It is clear that each (barring Sukha and Gumana whowere already there) as\u00ad sembled at the spot because of the cries of Parsia and Chhotiya and because of the noise of the fight. That imports acommon factor into their meeting and links them together as an assembly. Their object in as\u00ad sembling may have been innocent but the fact that acommon factor like this induced them to come to\u00ad gether constitutes them into an \"assembly\" though not, on that evidencealone, into an unlawful as\u00ad sembly.We next have to see whether any of them had an unlawfulobject in view. The object of Sukha and Gumana wasclearlyunlawful.Now the evidence which has been believedshows that the other nine actually joined in the beating and that they did this\u00b7 after Sukha had fired his gun at Parsia and Parsia had fallen to the ground. It also shows that these others turned on Parsia's relations and friends when they came to their support. Therefore, whatever the originalobject of each may have been, it achieved a unity of purpose the moment the others joined in and continued to assist Sukha and Gumana and helped them to beat up the other Baories who came to Parsia's help. It is not a case of stray sporadic acts but indicates a certain continuity of purpose, each striving to achieve the same end, namely either to help Sukha and Gumana in beating up Parsia and Chhotiya and those who came to help them or to join in the beating for ends of their own. But the com\u00ad monness of purpose is an inference of fact which courts of fact wouldbe entitled to make. It does not matter whether the others joined in because of an initial instigation or whether, seeing the assault in progress, they joined in on their own account, because solong as each had the object of beating up Parsia and Chhotiya and thosewho came to their assistance, that would make their object common. The distinction between the common intention re\u00ad quired by section34 of the Indian Penal Code and the common object set out in section 149 lies just S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 301 there. In a caseundersection 149 there need not be apriormeeting of minds. It is enough that each has the sameobject in view and that their number is fiveor more and that they act as an assembly to achieve that object.All thesefeaturesare to be found in that part of theevidencewhich has been believed.Therefore,on thesefindingswhich the courts of fact are entitledto reach, the object of the assemblywas unlawful, but up to this point the highestcommondenominatorwas merely to beat and not to kill. Up to that point, the convictions of the learnedSessions Judge under section325/149, Indian Penal Code, are unassailable.The next question is whether, that being the case, the convictions by the High Court undersection302/149can be upheld. Neither the Sessions Judge nor the High Court be\u00ad lieve that therewas any common intention to kill, therefore the convictionsfor the more seriousoffence canonlybe sustainedunder section 149 if it can be shown (1) that an actual killing of some of the persons attacked waslikely to resultfrom the beatingwhich formed the commonobject and (2) that each person soconvictedknew that that might be a likelyresult. Nowso far as Sukha and Gumanaare concerned, therecan be nodoubt.They started the fight with deadlyweapons. Sukha fired at least twice and hit two persons. He himself may not have had an in\u00ad tention to kill and indeed the fact that the wounds are on non-vital parts must be used as a factor in his favour, but any personwho carries a fire arm at that hour of the night and uses it and then continuesa fight after an excitedcrowd has assembled and when at leastnine of them rush in to join in the beating after his first shot must know either that somebodyis likely to deala fatal blowor at least that the cumu\u00ad lative effect of blowsinflicted by a number of persons armedwith la thisis likely to cause death fromshock. Riots of this kind are common and death frequently results,therefore, not only was a killing a likelycon\u00ad sequence of such an assault conducted in this fashion but Sukha and Gumana asmen of ordinary intelli\u00ad gence must haveknown that. 1956 Sukha and others v. The State of Rajasthau BoseJ, 1956 Stikha and others v. The State of Rajasthan Bose J. 302 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] Much the same considerations apply in the case of the other appellants. They rushed in to hit persons who had already beenfired on and who had been felled to the ground. They werein the midst of a crowdwhich could hardly have been calm and im\u00ad passive and they joined in with several others to beat themup. Any man of reasonableintelligencewould have known that somebody would be likely to be killed in a meleelike that. Therefore, the requisite knowledge can be imputed to them also. Twoquestionsremain. One was directed against the reliability of that part of the evidence that has been believed. The argument, for all its repetition, length and eloquence,was the hackneyed one that when one part of a witness' evidence is disbelieved, it is unsafe to act on the rest of his testimony. The answeris equally hackneyed, namely that judges of fact have the right to do this and that this is not a court of appeal when it acts under article 136. The findings about this are concurrent, so,following our usual practice, we decline to review the evidence. The other is that the absence of this in the charge occasionedprejudice. We have recently decided that we willbe slow to entertain question of prejudice when details are not furnished; also the fact that the objectionis not taken at an early stage will be taken into account. There is not a hint of prejudice in the petition filed by the appellants here in the High Court for leave to appeal to this Court; nor was this con\u00ad sidered a ground for complaint in the very lengthy and argumentative petition forspecialleave filed in this Court. The only complaint about prejudicewas on the score that there was no proper examination under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code. We decline to allow this matter to be raised. The appeal fails and is dismissed. \u2022 I"

The ap- The State of Assam peals have come up before us in circumstanceswhich may shortly be recounted. On 6th December1954 the appellant Raja Bhai\u00ad rabendra Narain Bhup of Bijni filed T. S. No. 27 of 1954 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Lower Assam District at Dhubri praying, interalia, for a declaration that the Assam State Acquisition of Zamindaris Act,1951(Assam Act XVIII of 1951) as amended by Assam Act VI of 1954 was not validly p1tssed, was not law at all and was unconstitutional, ultra vires and void and for a declaration that the impugned Act was, at any rate, inapplicable to the plaintiff's properties and the Notification purporting to be issued under section3(1) of the impugned Act in respect of the plaintiff's properties was illegal, ultravires and void. On the 23rdDecember,1954 the appellant Sm. Bedabala Debi wife of Sri Nripendra Narain Choudhu~y as the Trustee of Chapor Tmst estate filed T. S. No. 34 of 1954 in the Court of the Subordi\u00ad nate Judge of LowerAssam District at Dhubri challenging the constitutionality of the same Act. In this suit there was no contention, as there was in the Raja's suit, that the Act, if valid, did not apply to the estate of whichshe was the Trustee. By twoseveral orders made under article228 by the Assam High Court on the 21st January 1955 and the 16th February 1955respectively the said two suits were transferred to the High Court and renumbered as T.

(3) Whether the saidAct and its amendments infringe the fundamental rights of the plaintiff under article 31 (2) and article14 of the Constitution; or whether the legislationis protected under article 31-A and article 31(4) of the Constitution? (4) Whether the provisions of the Act and its amendments can be enforced against the properties in suit, even if the legislation is\u2022held to be valid? (5)To what relief, if any,is the plaintiffentitled? The parties through their respectivecounsel agreed that the issues of law which did not depend upon adjudication of disputed facts shouldbe heard and decidedfirst, leaving the other issues, if necessary, to be dealt with later. The two caseswere heard by a Full Bench of the Assam High Court. The learned Judges answered issues1 and 3 against the plaintiffs, although not for identical reasons.They also answeredissue 2 against the plaintiffs,subject, as to the Raja, the plaintiffin T.S. No. 1 of 1955, to the answer to issue4. On the last mentionedissue the Bench held that the Act and the Notificationbeing valid they couldbe enforced against Sm. Bedabala, the plaintiffin T. S. No.3 of 1955. As regards the Raja, the plaintiffin T.S. No. 1 of 1955, the Bench held that as the question whether the properties of the Raja sought to have been noti\u00ad fiedwere \"estate\" within the meaning of the im\u00ad pugnedAct wasone of fact,issue4 could only be decided, as between the Raja and the defendant State, upon evidenceled in the case. In the result the Bench dismissed Sm. Bedabala's T.S. No.3 of 1955 with costs and directed the records of the Raja's T.S. No. 1 of 1955 to be sent down to the court below for trial and disposal on the determination of issue4 and other issues.

The State of Assam At the hearing beforeus arguments have proceeded on issues 1, 2 and 3. It willbe convenient, therefore, Das C.J. to deal with the issuesseriatim. Re issue-1: Issue 1, it will be observed, has two parts. The first relates to the competence of the State Legislature in enacting the impugned law and the second part relates to the question whether the impugnedAct was enacted according to law.As a greater emphasis has beenlaid by learned counsel ap\u00ad pearing in support of the appealson the second part of this issue, we take up and deal with that part first. The facts bearing on this part of the issue may now besummarised. On the 11th August1948 a Bill calledAssam State Acquisition of Zamindaris Bill was published in the AssamGazette. On the 23rd September 1948 the Bill wasintroduced in the Legis\u00ad lative Assembly of Assam,which was its only Legis\u00ad lative Chamber. The Bill was passed by the Legis\u00ad lative Assembly on the 28thMarch1949. The Gov\u00ad ernor of Assam, acting under section75 of the Gov\u00ad ernment of India Act, 1935,reserved the Bill for the consideration of the Governor-General. In view of the then impendingcommencement of the Constitu\u00ad tion, the Governor-Generalon the 25th January 1950 returned the Bill to the Governor of Assam with the remark that the Bill be reservedfor the consideration of the President. On the 26th of January 1950 the Constitution of India came into force.Two days later, that is to say, on the 28th January 1950, the Governor of Assam actually received back the Bill. The Governor of Assam then reserved the Bill for the consideration of the President and sent the Bill to the President. In October1950 the President returned the Bill to the Governor of Assam suggest\u00ad ing certain alterations. The Bill, together with the suggested amendments, was placedbefore the Legis\u00ad lative Assembly of Assam. The LegislativeAssembly S.C.R. SUPREMECOURT REPORTS 309 considered the suggested alterations and passed the 1956 Bill suitably amended. The amendedBill thereupon - was again forwarded to the President and on the 27th R~a Bhair~~n;ra July 1951 it received the assent of the President and ara:v;~ \" becameAssam Act XVIII of 1951. The Act was The State of Assam published in the Assam Gazette of the 8th August 1951. On the 11th September 1951 the Legislative Das C.J. Assemblypassed a BillamendingAssam Act XVIII of 1951 in certain particulars and this Bill, having beenreserved by the Governorfor the consideration of the President, received the assent of the President on the 25th March1954 and becameAssam Act VI of 1954. The Acts were brought into forceon the 15th April1954 by a Notificationissued by the .Assam Government on the 9th June 1954. On the 19th July 1954 a. Notificationwas publishedin the Assam Gazette under section 3(1) of the impugned Act declaring that the properties therein mentioned, in- cluding the propertieswhich formed the subject- matter of the two suits would vest in the State free fromall encumbrances with effectfrom the 15th April1955.Two suits out of which the present appealsarise were then filed in December1954. The second part of issue 1 raises the contention that the impugnedAct was not enacted according to law. The followingreasons have been urged in sup\u00ad port of this contention. (a) The Bill was introduced in the Assembly without the sanction of the Governorwhich was re\u00ad quired by section299(3) of the Government of India Act. (b) When the Billwas placedbefore the Governor-Generalfor his assent and he did not assent to it, the assent must bedeemed to have been with\u00ad held.His suggestion that it be reservedfor the con\u00ad sideration of the President was void and of no effect. (c) The Billwas not pending in the Legislature at the date of the commencement of the Constitution and it could not be reservedfor the assent of the President. (d) The Legislaturefunctioning under the Con\u00ad stitution has no power to consider the amendment~ 310 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956) 1956 suggested by the President or to pass the same. . -. (e) The Bill having been passed by the Legisla- Ra1a Bhairebendra \u00b7 A bld th ft h \u00b7 bd Narayan Bhup t1ve ssem . y an.erea er avmg een reserve v. for the consideration of the Governor-General under Tlw State of Assam the Government of India Act,1935 and the Governor\u00ad General not having taken any constitutional action Das C.J. in respect of it, as prescribed by that Act up to the time that Act was operating, the Bill lapsed on the repeal of the Government of India Act,1935 and the promulgation of the Constitution. (f) The subsequent acts of the Governor, the Legislative Assembly and the purported assent of the President are all unconstitutional and void. The reason under heading (a) above may be dis\u00ad posed of in a fewwords. The impugned .Act un\u00ad doubtedly provides for the compulsory acquisition of land and had, therefore, to comply with the require\u00ad ments of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935,whichwas in force at the date of the introduc\u00ad tion of the Bill in the LegislativeAssembly of the province of Assam. Sub-section (3) of that section provided that no Bill making provisionfor the trans\u00ad ference to public ownership of any land should be introduced in either Chamber of Federal Legislature without the previous sanction of the Governor-Gene\u00ad ral in his discretion or in a Chamber of Provincial Legislature without the previous sanction of the Gov\u00ad ernor in his discretion. It was alleged that the pre\u00ad vious sanction of the Governor of Assam had not been obtained before the Bill,which eventually be\u00ad came the impugned Act, was introduced in the Legis\u00ad lative Assembly. This allegation was controverted and the learned Advocate-General of Assam produced before the High Court the minutes of the official pro\u00ad ceedings in relation to the Bill. The Revenue De\u00ad partment's file No. RT 17/48dated the 21st July 1948 shows that a note was put up before \"H.E.\", mean\u00ad ing obviously His Excellency the Governor,seeking, amongst other things, his sanction for the introduc\u00ad tion of the Assam State Acquisition of Zamindaris Bill, 1948 under section 299(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. At the foot of that note appear the S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 311 initials \"A.H.\" over the date 21st July, 1948. It is 1956 not disputed that the initials \"A.H.\" stand for Akbar R .- H.hhG \u00b7 f A I \u00b7 a1a Bhairebendra ydari, who was t en te overnor o ssam.t IS Narayan BhuJ> true that the words \"sanction granted\" were not v. endorsedon the note but there can be no doubt that The State of Assam the initials were appended to the note by the Governor for no other purpose than for signifyinghis sanction to the introduction of the Bill in the Legislative Assembly.Moreover under section 109 of that Act, if there were no other defect vitiating it, the impugned Act could not be challengedas invalid by reasononly that previous sanction was not given by the Governor to the introduction of the Bill. In our judgment the first reasonurged in support of the contention that the impugnedAct was not enacted according to law has no force and must be rejected. The reasons(b) to (f) may convenientlybe dealt with together. It will be recalled that after the Bill had beenpassed by the AssamLegislativeAssembly on the 28th March,1949, it was presented to the Governor under section 75 of the Government of India Act, 1935. Under that Act the Governorcould do one of fourthings. He could in his discretiondeclare that he assentedin HisMajesty's name to the Bill or that he withheld assent therefrom or that he reserved the Billfor the consideration of the Governor-General or he could in hisdiscretion return the Bill together with a messagerequesting the Chamber or Chamhers to reconsider the Bill or any specifiedprovisions thereof. In this case the Governorin hisdiscretion reserved the Bill for the consideration of the Governor\u00ad General and forwarded the Bill to him. Under sec\u00ad tion 76 of that Act the Governor-Generalcould do one of four things, namely, that hecouldin his discre\u00ad tion declare that he assentedin HisMajesty'sname to the Bill or that he withheld assent therefromor that he reserved the Bill for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure thereon or hecould, if in his dis\u00ad cretionhe thought fit, direct the Governor to return the Bill to the Cham her or Chambers of the Provincial Legislature together with sucha messageas was men\u00ad tioned in the precedingsection. What happened in Das C.J. 312 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956) 19s6 this case is that, in view of the impending constitu- R . 8 -. b. tional changes, the Governor-General,on the 25th a7a haire endra J 1950 d h B' hGf Narayan Bhup anuary , returne te ill to te overnor o v. Assam advisinghim to reserve the Billfor the con\u00ad Tiie State of Assam sideration of the President. While the Billwasin transit and before it was actually received by the Das C.J. Governor,which he did on the 28th January 1950, our Constitution came into force on the 26th Janu\u00ad ary 1950. Our attention is drawn to article395 of the Con\u00ad stitution, whereby the Indian IndependenceAct, 1947 and the Government of India Act,1935 together with all enactments, amending or supplementing the latter Act but not including the Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act, 1949,were repealed. It is pointed out that there was no savingprovision in that article and consequently it was a total repeal of the enact\u00ad ments referred to therein.Referenceis made to the well-known observations of Tindal, C. J. in Kay v. Godwin(') and the dictum of Lord Tenterden, C. J. in Surtees v. Ellison( 9 ) and to Craies' Statute Law, 4th Edition, pp.347 to 348 and Crawfordon Statutory Construction,pp. 599 to 600, all referred to by Faz! Ali, J. in KeshavanMadhava Menon v. The State of Bombay(') and it is contended that the effect of the repeal of the Government of India Act,1935 was to obliterate that Act as completelyas if it had never been passed and as if it had never existed except for the purpose of those actions commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilstit was an existinglaw. The Bill in question not having become an Act before the 26th January 1950 the same, it is urged, must be regarded as having beenwiped out of existence by reason of the repeal.There might have beena gooddeal of force in this con ten ti on had there been no other pro\u00ad visionin the Constitution keeping this Bill alive. Article389 of the Constitution provides that a Bill which immediately before the commencement of the Constitution was pending in the Legislature of the (ll (1830) 180 E.R. 1403; 6 Bing. 576. (2) (1829)9 B. & 0. 750, 762; 109 E.R. 278, 279. (8) [196) S.O.R. 228,237 et seq, S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 313 Dominion of India or in the Legislature of any Pro- 1956 vince or Indian State may, subject to any provisions R 1 Bh-. bd h h \u2022 hb.ldd.ld aa a\u2022re en ra to te contrary w ic may e meuemru es ma e Narayan BhuJ> by Parliament or the Legislature of the correspond- v. ing State under this Constitution, be continued in The State of Assam Parliament or the Legislature of the corresponding- State, as the case may be, as if the proceedings taken Das C.J. with reference to the Bill in the Legislature of the Dominion of India or in the Legislature of the Pro- vince or Indian State had been taken in Parliament or in the Legislature of the corresponding State. If, therefore, the Bill with whichwe are concernedwas pending in the Legislature of Assam immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, then clearly it was quite properly continued in the Legis- lature of the corresponding State. Twoquestions, therefore, arise, namely ( 1) whether at the commence- ment of the Constitution the Billwas pending at all and (2)\u00b7 if it was, whether it waspending in the Legislature of Assam. As to (1):-Section 30 of the Government of India Act, 1935 made provisionfor the introduction of Bills in the Chambers of the Federal Legislature and section 73 provided for the introduction of Bills in the Chamber or Chambers of the Provincial Legis\u00ad lature. Section 32 of the Act laid down provisions for presentation of the Billpassed by the Federal Legislative Chambers to the Governor-General and section75 for the presentation of the Billpassed by the ProvincialLegislative Chamber or Chambers to the Governor. Broadly speaking it may be said that a Billbegins to pend with its introduction in the Legislative Chamber and it ceases to pend-(a) when it lapses under section73(4) or (b) when the Gover\u00ad nor declares that he assents in hisMajesty's name to the Bill in whichcase the Bill ripens into an Act or ( c) when the Governordeclares that he withholds his assent therefrom, in which case the Bill falls through or (d) whenbeingreserved by the Governorfor the consideration of the Governor-General, the Governor\u00ad General acting under section76 declares that he assents in HisMajesty's name to the Bill, in which case also 314 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 the Bill becomes an Act or (e) when, having been so R . 8~ b reserved by the Governor, the Governor-Generalde- i:'aray::\u00b7s~:~\u00b7 clares that he withholds his assent therefrom, in which v. caseagain the Bill falls through or (f) when the Bill :rh\u2022 State of Assam having beenreserved by the Governor-Generalfor Das C.J. the signification of His Majesty's pleasure thereon under section 76(1), tbe Governorunder section76(2) makesknown by public notification that His Majesty had assented thereto, in which case again the Bill becomes an Act and lastly (g) whenno such notifica\u00ad tion is issued by the Governor within twelve months from the date on which it was presented to the Gov\u00ad ernor, in which event also the Billcomes to an end. In short a Bill may be said to bepending as longas it does not lapse or it does not become an Act by re\u00ad ceiving the assent by the appropriate authority or is not terminated by the withholding of assent by such appropriate authority. The contention of the appel\u00ad lant is that when the Bill under consideration had been, under section76, reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the Governor-General and sent to the Governor-General and the latter did not declarehis \u00b7assent in the name of His Majesty to the Bill but sent it back to the Governor, the Governor-General must be deemed to have withheld his assent from the Bill.As already stated, under section76, the Governor-Generalcould have declared that he assented in the name of His Majesty to the Bill or that he withheldhis assent therefrom, or that he reserved the Bill for the signification of His Majesty's pleasure or he could have returned it to the Governor for being presented to the Chamber for reconsi\u00ad deration but he could not do anything else. There\u00ad fore,his act of returning the Bill to the Governor with the suggestion to place it before the Presi\u00ad dent was, it is urged,wholly unauthorised and amounted to his withholding his assent from the Bill. We are unable to accept this argument a.ssound. The Governor-Generalknew that if he declared that he withheld his assent then the Billwouldcome to a termination and no further step could be taken in relation to that Bill.Therefore,when the Governor- S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 315 General returned the Bill to the Governor with the 1956 suggestion that the sameBill be reservedfor the con- R . Bh-:- bd 'd t' f th p 'd t th GGl a1a aire en ra s1 era 10n oe res1 en ,eovernor- enera Narayan BhuJ> quite clearly evinced an intention that the Bill should v. remain alive, for otherwise there couldbe noquestion The State of Assam of further reservation of the sameBill for the consi\u00ad deration of the President. The verysuggestion of the further reservation of the Bill for the consi- deration of the President makes it impossiblefor us to hold, inferentially or fictionally, as we are asked to do, that the Governor-General had withheld his assent. It isclearon the facts that the Governor- General neither assented to, nor withheld his assent from, the Bill.His action may have been unconsti- tutional, but it cannot be regardedas amounting to a declaration that hewaswithholdinghis assent from the Bill, for the assentingto, or the withholding of assent froma Bill postulates a conscious and positive declaration that the assent issogiven or withheld. The suggestion that the Billbe reservedfor the consi- deration of the President clearly militates against the view that the Governor-Generalhad, positively or even tacitly, w\u00b7ithheld his assent from the Bill. The very suggestionindicates that the Governor-General intended that the Bill should remain pendingso that it could be reservedfor the consideration of the Pre- sident and receive his assent or dissent. In the pre- mises it cannot beheld that the Billceased to be pending by reason of the assent of the Governor- Generalhaving been withheldfrom it. In our view, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the Bill was pending at the date when our Constitution came into force. As to (2):-Learned counselfor the appellant then contends that even if the Bill was pending, it was certainly not pendingbefore the Legislature of Assam. What, then, was the Legislature of the Pro\u00ad vince of Assam immediatelybefore the commence\u00ad ment of our Constitution? This involves a considera\u00ad tion of the relevant provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Government of India Act, 1935 wasa statute passedby the British Parliament. The Das C.J. 316 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1956] 1956 Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain R . 8-:- b and Northern Ireland consists of the Sovereign and a1a ha.re endra hhEfhR 1 1 hL Narayan Bhup te t ree states oteea m, name y,teords v. Spiritual and the LordsTemporal,who sit together The State of Assam iI1 the House of Lords and the elected representatives of the people, who sit in the House of Commons. Das C.J. When a Billis passed by both Houses of Parliament or ispassed by the House of Commons in the manner provided by Parliament Act,1911, it becomes ready to receive the Royal assent.No Billpassed by both Houses of Parliam&nt or in the last mentionedcase by the House of Commons can become law and be en\u00ad tered in the Statute Book without the Royal assent. It is thus clear that, according to British Constitu\u00ad tional theory, the Sovereignis an integral part of Parliament. This notion is reflectedin sections17, 55 and 56 of the British North AmericaAct, with regard to the Canadian Parliament and sections 69, 71 and 90 of the same Act with regard to the Pro\u00ad vincial Legislatures of that Dominion. The same idea was adopted in the Government of India Act, 1935. Section 18 of this Act, as it originallystood, provided fora Federal Legislatureconsisting of His Majesty represented by the Governor-General and two Cham\u00ad bers to be knownrespectively as the Council of States and the House of Assembly. Section60 provided for a Legislaturefor every Province consisting of His Majesty represented by the Governor and in certain Provinces two Chambers and in other Pro\u00ad vinces one Chamber.As already stated the Province of Assam had only one Chamber, the Legislative Assembly. The legislativeprocedure of the Chambers of the Federal Legislaturewas regulated by section 30 and of the Chamber or Chambers of the Provincial Legislatures by section 73 of the Government of India Act,1935.Procedure subsequent to the passing of the Bill by the LegislativeChamber or Chambers was governed by section32 with regard to Billspassed by the Chambers of the Federal Legislature and by sections 75 and 76 with regard to those passed by the Chamber or Chambers of the Provincial Legislatures. It is true that section18 of the Government of S.C.R. SUPREMECOURT REPORTS 317 India Act, 1935 was adapted. as contemplated by 1956 section 9 of the Indian IndependenceAct, 1947, but . 8-. hd . f. 60 f hG Ra1a ha\u2022rebendra t erewas no a aptat10n o sect10n oteovern- Narayan Bhup ment of India Act, 1935 which dealt with the v. Provincial Legislature. From the languageused in The State of Assam section 18, as it stood before its adaptation and in section 60, it is quite clear that it wasHis Majesty himself,who was really a constituent part of the Legislatures, Federal and Provincial, and that he was represented by the Governor-General in relation to the Federal Legislature and by the Governorin the case of the Provincial Legislatures.His Majestybe- ing, thus, an integral part of the Legislature, Federal and Provincial,when a Bill passed by the Chambers of the Federal Legislatureor by the Chamber or Chambers of Provincial Legislatures,was presented to the Governor-General or the Governor under sec- tion 32 or sections 75 and 76 of that Act, the Legis- lative process went on and unless and until assent was given or withheld by the Governor-Generalor the Governor in the name of His Majestythere could be no escapefrom the position that in law and in reality the Bill was pendingbefore His Majesty,for the Governor-Generalor the Governor was, under that Act, merely the agent representing His Majesty, whowas an integral part of the Legislature. This was made clear by the provision that when the Gevernor-General or the Governordeclared that he assented or that he withheldhis assent,such decla- ration had to be made in the name of His Majesty. Therefore, whether the Bill wasin the hands of the Governor or in the hands of the Governor-Generalor was in transit between the one and the other on either way, it must be taken to havebeen pendingbefore His Majesty and, therefore,before the Legislature. The declaration giving or withholding assent was un- doubtedly a continuation of the legislativeprocess and until such declarationwas made by the appro- priate agency in the name of His Majestyobviously the Bill was pending and where,in law and in reality, could it at that stage bependingexcept before His Majestyas an integral part of the Legislature? Such Das C.J. 318 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 1956 being the position under article 389 read with the re- R . -. b levant provisions of the Government of India Act, a1aBhaore endra \u00b7 hd \u2022t th\" B\"Jj Jd Jb Narayan Bhup as we appre en I, IS 1 cou proper yecon- v. tinuedin the Legislature of Assam after the commence- Th\u2022 State of Assam ment of our Constitution. Under article 168 of Das C.J. our Constitution every State has a Legislature con\u00ad sisting of the Governor and in certain States two Houses and in other States, whichincludeAssam, one House. The Bill having beenpassed by the Legisla\u00ad tiveAssembly of Assambefore the commencement of the Constitution, all that was required to be done under the Constitution was to continue the legislative process-under article 200. It was,therefore,compe\u00ad tent for the Governor of Assam to reserve the Bill for the consideration of the President and it was in order for the President, under article 201, to direct the Governor to return the Bill to the Legislative Assembly of the State together with the requisite message and it was quite proper for the Legislative Assembly,when the Bill was so returned, to consider it accordingly. It follows,therefore, that when the Bill was againpassed by the LegislativeAssembly of Assam, it was proper to represent the Bill to the President for his consideration and it was open to the President to give his assent to the amended Bill, as he, in fact, did. Relianceis placed by learnedcounsel for the appel\u00ad lant on article 31(4) and to a passage in the Judg\u00ad ment of this court in Visweshwar Rao v. TheState of Madhya Pradesh(') and it is contended that the word \"Legislature'', whichoccurs both in article 31(4) and article 389 means only the Chamber or Chambers of the Legislature and not the Governor or the Gov\u00ad ernor-General.We need not discuss the larger ques\u00ad tion as to the correct interpretation of the word \"Legislature\" as occurring in article 31(4) and suffice it to say that the very passagerelied on by learned counselmakes it quite clear that the word \"Legisla\u00ad ture\" is used in differentsenses in different articles and may be in differentsenses in different places in the same article and its meaning has to be ascertained (1) [1952] S.C.R.1020, 103,. S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 319 1956 keeping in view the subject or the context. In Tiew of the provisions of sections 18, 30 and 32 and sec- . ; 7d 76 f hG fJ d\" Raja Bhairebe11dra t10ns 60, 73, 5 an ote overnment on Ia Narayan Bhu:P Act,1935 to whichreference has been made,we are v. clearly of opinion that the word \"Legislature\" has The state of Assam been used in article 389 in the larger sense, namely, comprisingall the units that were concernedin the entire legislativeprocess and included His Majesty representedby the Governor-Generalor the Governor, as the case might be.We findno reason to think that our Constitution intended only to keepalive theBillswhichwere actually pendingbefore the Legislative Chamber or Chambers but not those which having been passed by the Legislative Chamber or Chambers had beenpresented to the Governor-Gene- ral or the Governor and wereundergoing the final legislativeprocess and awaiting the assent of His Majesty represented by the Governor-Generalor Gov- ernor, as the case might be.We are,therefore, of opinion, although for differentreasons, that the High Court properlyanswered the first part of issue (1). Re. issue (2):-The Act having beenproperly passed by the Legislature of Assam, the Government of Assamwas well within their rights under section 3 of the Act to declare that the estates of the tenure holdersspecifiedin the Notificationvested in the State free fromall encumbrances.There is no sug\u00ad gestion that the properties of Sm. Beda Bala Devi, the plaintiff in 'I'. S.No.3 of 1955,were not \"estates\" within the meaning of the Act and accordingly the High Court has correctly decided this issuein favour of the State, so far as that plaintiff is concerned. The Raja, the plaintiff in T.S. No.' 1 of 1955,however, raised the contention that hispropertieswere not \"estates\" as defined in the Act and that being the subject matter of issue( 4), this aspect of issue (2) wasalso left open until the decision of issue(4). As the High Court has sent down the suit to the court of Subordi~ate Judge for disposal and determination of other issues, the finalanswer to issue(2), as regards the Raja, will dependon the determination of issue (4) and must until then be kept open. ~2 Das C.J. 320 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 Re. issue (3):-The Act and its amendments are - challenged on the ground that they infringe the funda- R\u00abf;:,~';.:'!~:J,ra mental rights of the plaintiff under article 31 (2) and v. article 14 of the Constitution. If, however, the legis- The State of Assam lation is protected under article 31-A of the Constitu\u00ad tion then the question of infringement of funda- Das C.J. mental rights of the plaintiff under articles 31 (2) and 14willnot arise. Article31(4) protects an Act falling within it only against the contravention of the provi\u00ad sions of clause (2) of that article but not of those of article 14.Article 31-A, however, protects an Act falling within it even if it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of Part III. It is obvious, there\u00ad fore, that article 31-Agives greater and wider protec\u00ad tion than does article 31(4). If, therefore, article 31-A appliesno question can arise under article 31 (2) or article 14 and in that case article 31(4)need not be invoked at all. What is protected by article 31-Ais a law provid\u00ad ingfor the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights. There is noquestion that the impugned Act, having beenreservedfor the consideration of the President, has in fact received his assent and, therefore, the proviso to article 31-A does not come into play. The only question then is-is the impugned Act a law providingfor the acquisition of an estate or any rights there\u00ad in? The expression \"estate\" in relation to any local area, has been made by clause (2) (a) of this article, to have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent hasin the existing law relat\u00ad ing to land tenures in force in that area. The pre\u00ad amble to the impugned Act recites the expediency of providing for the acquisition by the State of the in\u00ad terests of proprietors and tenure-holders and cer\u00ad tain other interests in the permanently settled areas and certain other estates in the districts of Goalpara, GaroHills and Cachar in the State of Assam including their interests in forests,fisheries, hats, bazars and ferries,mines and minerals. Section S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 321 3 of that Act authorizes the State Government to t9S6 dsclare, fromtime to time, by Notifications that the R . Bh-. b a . a7a atre en ra estate or tenure of a proprietor or tenure-holderspe- Narayan Bhup cified in the Notificationshall stand transferred to v. and vest in the State freefromall encumbrances. The State of Assam Section 4 laysdown the consequences that are to follow. It is thus clear that the Act purports to be alawfor the acquisitionby the 1 State of estates or tenures. The word \"estate\" as defined in section 2(k)meanslands includedunder one entry in any of the generalregisters of revenuepaying and revenue- free lands prepared and maintained under the lawfor the timebeingin forceby the Deputy Com- missioner and includesrevenue-freelands not entered in any register. Under the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation(Reg. I of 1886) the Deputy Commissioner of every districtis, by section 48, en- joined to prepare and keep in the prescribedform and manner a generalregister of revenue-paying estates, a generalregister of revenue-freeestates and such other registers as the Governmentmay direct. Section 49 provides that untilsuch registersare pre- pared the Government may direct that the existing registers kept by or under the control of the Deputy Commissionershall be deemed to be registersprepared under section 48. It will be noticed that what are to be entered in the generalregistersare revenue-paying or revenue-freeestates. The word \"estate\" is defined by section3(b) to includesix kinds of landsdescribed in the six' clausestherein set out. This definition does not purport to be an exhaustive definition of \"estate\" but onlyincludescertain enumerateditems within the meaning of that expression.The word \"estate\" is defined in the GoalparaTenancy Act (Assam Act I of 1929) exactly in the same way as it is defined in the impugnedAct, namely,as meaninglands includedunder one entry in any of the GeneralRegis- ters of revenue-paying or revenue-freelands prepared and maintained by the Deputy Commissioner. The properties of both the plaintiffsappellantsare and have been in point of fact entered in the General Register.An \"estate\" within the meaning of the Das C.J. 322 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956) 1956 Assam Land and Revenue RegulationI of 1886 is also R. Bh-:- b 4 ail \"estate\" within the meaning of the Goalpara a1a aJre en ra TA (A I f l. Narayan Bhuf> enancy ct ct o 929) and of the impugnedAct. ... The impugnedAct, therefore,is a lawprovidingfor The State of Assam the acquisition by the State of an \"estate\" within the Das C./. meaning of article31-A and, that beingso, its consti\u00ad tutionality or validity cannot be questionedon the ground of any cont;avention of any of the provisions of Part III of theConstitutiondealing with funda\u00ad mental rights.There is nodispute that the lands comprised in the trust estate of Sm. Beda Bala Devi, the plaintiff in T. S. No.3 of 1955is an \"estate\" as defined in each of the aforesaid statutes including the impugnedAct. The questionwhether the amount paid by the Raja, the plaintiff in T. S. No. 1 of 1955, isrevenue or tribute, whetherhis properties have beenfrombefore1886 enteredproperly in the General Register of revenue-paying estate and whet.hersuch propertiescome within the operation of the impugned Act,are the subject matter of issue(4), but those questions have nobearingon the question whether the impugnedAct is entitled to the protection of article31-A. If the plaintiff Raja's properties are not \"estate\" as defined in the Assam Land and Revenue Regulation or the GoalparaTenancy Act or the impugnedAct, then the Notification under sec\u00ad tion 3 of the impugned Act will not affect him but that willbe, not because the impugned Act is not a lawprovidingfor the State acquisition of an. \"estate\" but, bees.use the Raja's .properties are not \"estates\" within the purview of the impugnedAct. The fact that the definition of \"estate\" in the Assam Land and Revenue Regulationis only an inclusive and not an exhaustivedefinition, that the Raja's properties have been in fact entered in the GeneralRegister of revenue-payinglands and that the lands falling with\u00ad in any of the six categories enumerated in section3(b) of the Assam Land and RevenueRegulationwill certainlyfall within the wider ambit of the definition of \"estate\" given in the impugned Act cannot be overlooked. The impugnedAct is nonetheless a law providingfor State acquisition of \"estate\" even if its ) S.C.R. SUPREME COURT REPORTS 323 definition of \"estate\" comprises something more than 1956 what iscomprisedin the six categoriesincluded with- - in that term in section 3(b) of the Assam Land and RaNJa,.BhaireBbehn~ra RR l , f I.dh a a;yan u,,, evenue egu at10n o 1886.n our JU gment te v. impugned Act is fully protected by article 31-A. The State of Assam In the view we have taken on article31-A, it is un- necessary to discuss the question of the applicability Das C.J. of article 31(4).We have,however, to touch very brieflya fewsubsidiary points urgedbeforeus. It has been said that the impugned Act constitutes a colourableexercise of legislativepower, for while it purports to specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensationis to be deter\u00ad mined and given, it actually makes provisionswhich result in illusory compensationor no compensation at all. The doctrine of colourable legislationis rele\u00ad vant only in connection with the question of legisla\u00ad tive competencyas explained by this Court in K. 0. GajapatiNarain Deb v. State of Orissa(1). Here there is noquestion of any legislativeincompetency. The gravamen of the present complaint is as tot.he quan\u00ad tum of compensation,which, in view of the article 31-A, cannot be raised. Referencehas been made to section 11 of the im\u00ad pugned Act according to whichin the computation of the gross incomeis to be included the gross rent pay\u00ad able by the tenant immediately subordinate,for the agricultural years preceding the date of vesting. It is argued that the Act is vague and indefinite, be\u00ad cause of the use of the word \"years\" inplural. The High Court hasgivencogentreasons, with which we agree, for holding that the word \"years\" in the plural hasbeen retained in the Act by mistake or oversight and it should be read in the singular.Moreover, the Act has sincebeen amendedretrospectively by sec\u00ad tion 4 of AssamAct V of 1956 and the questiondoes not arise. The Act is alsoimpugnedon the ground of dis\u00ad crimination,which offendsarticle 14 of the Constitu\u00ad tion. This question again is not open to the appel\u00ad lant in view of our decisionon article31-A. Further (1) (1954] S.O.R. 1: A.LR. 1953 S 0. 375. 324 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1956] 1956 article 14 does not really help the appellant. It 'is R .. bd said that the State can pick and choose the estate of a1a Bha.re en ra\u2022 dd1h f h' f' Narayan BhuJ> one zam1.n ar an eave out t oseot e1r avounte v. ones, as mdeed they have sincedone by withdrawing Tlic State of Assam the Notification with respect to Gouripore and Prabatjoar estates. There is noforce in this conten- Das C.J. tion in view of the decisions of this court in Biswam\u00ad bhar Singh v. The State of Orissa andothers(') and Thakur Amar Singh v. State of Rajasthan(\u2022). It is said that the Act onlyapplies to some Lakhe\u00ad raj estates, that is to say, Lakheraj estates within the boundaries of a permanently settled estate but not to other Lakheraj estates. The acquisition of Lakhe\u00ad raj estates within the boundaries of permanently settled estates clearly facilitates the object of acquir\u00ad ing permanently settled areas and such Lakheraj estates within the boundaries of permanently settled estates constitute a class distinct from other Lakheraj estates not so situate and, therefore, the charge of discrimination cannot, in view of the principles laid down by this court, apply to the impugnedAct. Lastly it is said that there is discrimination because of different scales of compensationwhich have been prescribed for different estates. It is not difficult to finda rational basisfor such classification of proprie\u00ad tors of differentincome groups.We need not, how\u00ad ever, dilate on this point, for we have already held that the Actis not open to challenge on the ground of contravention of any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution. There was in the Raja's T. S. No. I of 1955,a prayer for injunction restraining the State from taking pos\u00ad session of his estate. The High Court has rejected that prayer on groundswhich appear to us to be quite cogent and convincing and as wesee no substantial risk of irreparable loss to the Raja wedo not consider it right to reverse even that order of the High Court. For reasons stated above both these appeals are dismissed with costs.As the two appeals were heard together there will be one set of costs of hearing to be apportioned equallybetween the two appellants.
