There is a tell-tale note at the topof the rulesframed by the Supreme Court forenrolmentof advocates and agents to the effect that the ruleswere subject to re\u00b7 vision and the judges had under considerationa pro- posal for abolishing the dualsystem.Abolish it by all means if the system has outgrownits usefulness and is foundincongruousin the new setting of a democraticConstitution. But to achievea dubiousor evena laudablepurpose by straining the law is hardly edifying. Politics and policies have noplacein the pure region of the law; and courts.oflaw wouldserve the country and the Constitution better by discarding all extraneous considerations and uncompromisingly observingdivine detachment which is the glory of law and the guarantee of justice.\" . Noobjectioncould have been taken to the article had it merely preached to the courts of law the sermon of divinedetachment. But when it proceeded to attribute impropermotives to the judges, it not only transgressed the limits of fair and bona fide criticism but had a cleartendencyto affect the dignity and prestigeof this Court. The article in qusst~on was thus a gross contempt of court. It is obvious that if an impressionis created in the minds of the public that the judges in the highest court in the laud act on extraneous considerationsin deciding cases, -the confidenceof the whole communityin the administrationof justiceis bound to beundermined and nogreatermischief than that can possiblybe imagined. It was for this reason that the rule was issued against the respondents. - 218 SUPREME COURT REPORTS [1953j J95a We are happy to find that the Editor, Printer and I n;-7 Ed\"t the Publisher of the paper in their respectiveaffi- n re,\" '\u00b0''d \"t. fil d. hd' h Printer and av1 semtese proceemgs ave frankly stated p,.blisher of thau theynow realize that iu the offendingarticle \"The Times of they had exceededthe limitsof legitimatecriticism in India''. that words or expressionswhich can be construed as castingreflectionupon the court and constituting Mahajan J. contempt had crept into it.

The Deputy Commissioner accordingly auctioned the fishery and submitted the bid list with a recommendation in the first respondent's favour. Government sanctioned the settlement of the fishery wi_th the first respondent and the latter was informed of the acceptance of the bid and directed to make the deposits. Government received two more petitions on the same day for re~consideration of the orders passed and three weeks later Government reviewed its order and settled the fishery with another person. The first respondent preferred an appeal to the High Court under r. 190 which provided that all orders of a Deputy Commissioner passed under these rules were appealable to tee High Court : Held, the words \" except with the previous sanction of the Provincial Government\" in r. 190-A do not permit the Provincial Government when it so wishes to lift the sa)es completely out of the statutory protection afforded by the Regulation and proceed to dispose of them by executive action. Such a construction would maker. 190-A run counter to s. 16 of the Regulation which requires these sales to be made under and in accordance with the Rules. The departure contemplated by r. 190-A was a departure within the Rules. As the Deputy Commissioner was the only authority competent to settle these fisheries, subject to sanction, the act of cancellation and the act of resettlement were his acts, however much he may have acted under the direction and orders of the Government, and the High Court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under r. 190.

The phrase \"in a reference\" in s. 31, sub-s. (4), of the Indian Arbitration Act 1940, is comprehensive enough to cover an application first made after the arbitration is completed and a final award made, and the sub-section vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Court in which an application for filing an \u2022ward has been first made nuder s. 14 of the Act. The respondent who was a party to an award filed its application before the Subordinate Judge of Gauhati under s. 14 (2) of the Indian Arbitration Act, on the 10th August, 1949, praying that the umpire may be directed to file the award in Court and upon this notice was issued to the umpire to file the award in Court before 24th August, 1949. As the original award had been handed over to the parties, the umpire sent by post on the 18th August, 1949, a copy of the award signed by him. The Court directed the respondent to file the original award in Court and he did so on the 3rd September, 1949. meanwhile the appellant's solicitors sent to the Registrar of the Calcutta High Court Original Side, on the 17th August, 1949, the original award for being filed in Court and the award was filed on the 29th August: Held, that, as the umpire had, on the direction of the Subordinate Judge of Gauhati sent a copy of the award signed by him to the Court on the 18th August, 1949, the earlier filing for the purposes of s. 31(3) of the Arbitration Act was in the Gauhati Court and not in the Calcutta High Court, though the original award was filed by the respondent in the Gauhati Court only after the appellant's solicitor had sent the award for filing to the Calcutta High Court. In the circumstances the Gauhati Court alone had jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing of the dispute - under s. 31 of the Act. "

Consequently, where a Hindu father who has mortgaged the joint family property for an antecedent debt which is not illegal or immoral becomes insolvent and the receiver sells the property, the interest of his sons in the property also vests in the purchaser, even in the case of a sale held before the Amendment Act of 1948 came into force, and the sons cannot redeem the property. Though the liability of a person who has purchase  equity of redemption after 22nd March, 1938, to pay the mortgage debt arises only on the date of his purchase, if the debt itself existed on the 22nd March, 1938, and if it was payable by an agriculturist on that date, the purchaser can claim the benefits conferred by s. 7 of the Madras Agricultural Relief Act, 1938, if he himself was an agriculturist on the date of his application.

On the 18th January, S submitted a draft will for sanction and the will as amended and sanctioned was executed on the 28th .July, 1904. 'this will provided as follows: \"after my death my wife for her lifetime shall remain in possession of my entire estate ...... without the power of any sort to transfer the said properties and rights, that on the death of the said wife all the aforesaid property and rights shall devolve on my cousin G with and proprietary powers and that on the death of G, the said entire property and rights shall devolve on X, Y, Z, sons of G, in the following shares .... \" The will also provided for maintenance for the daughter, sister, aunt and mother of S. On tho application of G's sons (G having died) letters of administration with the will annexed were granted to them by the Chief Court of Oudh and this decision was affirmed by the Privy Council on appeal in 1937. 'rhe heirs of S thereupon instituted a suit against the sons of G for a declaration that the will was inoperative and ineffectual and that G's sons had in any case no right to the properties of S, as S had no animus testandi and G had also failed to pay Rs. 50 to S as agreed: Held, (i) that the deed of agreement and the will formed parts of one transaction and formed one contract, consideration for the will being the agreement, and consideration for the agreement being the will; (ii) as the Privy Council had decided that the will was the last will and testament of S and granted letters of administration, the question of animus testandi was res judicata; (iii) with regard to the plea that the monthly payment of rs. 50 was a condition precedent to the validity of the will and that by reason of the non-fulfilment of this condition the will had become inoperative, such a plea was also barred by res judicata as the Privy Council had granted letters of administration; and even on the merits the plea was untenable as the wife and other relations of the testator had also certain rights under the will which did not depend on the monthly payment by G; (iv) the question whether the payment of rs. 50 was a condition precedent to the vesting of the legacy in G or G's sons was not, however, res judicata and it was open to the plaintiff to raise such a plea; (v} on a proper interpretation of the terms of the agreement, the payment of Rs 50 per month was not a condition precedent to vesting of the legacy in G, It merely a consideration, and the plaintiffs' remedy was to enforce the agreement if it was not v. duly performed;  vi) that as G obtained a vested remainder under the will, and Others. his interest did not [all into the residue on his death before the widow, but vested in his sons; and as the bequest to G did not lapse there was no question of and resulting trust or of any intestacy with respect to the remainder, and G's sons were entitled to the estate under the will.

Permanency of tenure does not necessarily imply both fixity of rent and fixity of occupation and the fact of enhancement of rent does not necessarily militate against the tenancy being a permanent one. When, therefore, in a previous suit the only question was whether the jama could be increased and the jama was increased : Held, that this decision did not operate as res judicata on the question of permanency of the tenure in a subsequent suit for ejectment. 'There possession for generations at a uniform rent, or construction of permanent structures by itself may not be conclusive proof  of a permanent right but the cumulative effect of such factor coupled with other facts may lead to the inference of  permanent tenancy. Where twas not known how the earliest known tenant acquired the tenancy or what the nature of the tenancy was, the tenancy had passed from one person to another by inheritance or by will or by transfer inter vivas, in the deeds of transfer the transferee was given the right to enjoy from generation to generation for ever, pucka structures and tanks had been constructed, and though there was an enhancement of rent in 1860, the rent had not been increased since then : Held, that all these circumstances put together irresistible led to the conclusion of a permanency of the tenure.

        "HeadNote": " A non-resident company manufactured textile goods at outside British India and sold the goods ex-mills. A firm, R & Co., guaranteed the sale-price of goods sold ex-mills by the company to purchasers at Ahmedabad within British India. As the company maintained its accounts according to the mercantile system, the company debited R & Co., with the price of goods sold and credited the sales account with the amount of the bills. R & Co., collected the amounts of the bills from the purchasers on behalf of the company and credited the sums realised in the company's account with banks at Ahmedabad and also disbursed them to creditors of the company in British India. These payments were credited by the company to R & Co. During the relevant accounting year the company thus received Rs. 12,68,480. The company also received Rs. 4,40,878 from sales to purchasers\u00b7 in British India. The amount of the sales bills for which hundis were drawn on the purchasers in favour of banks were debited by the company to the accounts of the respective merchants and credited to the sales account and the sums recieved by the banks from the purchasers against delivery of tho railway receipts were credited by the company to the accounts of the respective purchasers. In either case there was no change in the relationship of vendor and purchaser between the company and the purchasers by reason of the entries made in the company's hooks. The question as reframed by the High Court was whether these two sums were sale proceeds of the goods sold by the assesses to merchants in British India and whether they were received in British India and could be included in the assessable income of tho company in British India: Held, per Mehr Chand Mahajan, S. R. Das and Bhagwati J J., (Vivian Bose J. dissenting) that the two amounts in question were sale proceeds of the goods sold and delivered by the company to merchants in British India; that they were neither received by the company nor could be deemed to have been received by it when the entries were made in the books of account at P but had merely accrued or arisen to it there; that they were first received by R & Co. and by the banks through whom the railway receipts were negotiated on behalf of the company in British India; and Keshav Mills that they were therefore liable to tax under s. 4(1) Indian Income tax Act as having been received in British India on  its behalf.  Though it is true that in the case of residents, if the assessee employs the mercantile system regularly it is obligatory on the income-tax authorities to compute the income according to that system, it is doubtful whether that position would be available to a non-resident who maintains his books of account outside British India according to the mercantile system. Section 13 would only he relevant where the total profits of the assessee have to be computed and in that event the assessee would he entitled to claim that they should be computed according to the system of accounts maintained by him ; it would not be relevant when stray items of income are sought to he assessed in the taxable territories as received in the taxable territories by a non-resident. Bose J.-In the case of accounts kept in the mercantile system, the profit or loss at the end of the accounting year is based not on a difference between what was actually received and what was actually paid out, but on the difference between the right to receive and the liability to pay. the taxation in such cases is not on income, profits or gains which were received but on profits which \"accrued or arose\" to the assessee in the accounting yea.r. This view excludes s. 4(1) (a) and this means that a resident is taxed in such cases under s. 4(l)(b) and a non-resident under s. 4(1) (c). Applying s. 4(1) (c) to the present case, in the case of the Rs. 4 lakhs odd the profits accrued or arose in British India where the right to take delivery of the goods accrued and where the price was actually paid, but what is really taxable under s. 4 (1) (c) is not the Rs. 4 lakhs odd, but the figures entered in the accounting year as the p\"ice of the various transactions which the Rs. 4 lakhs represented. Similarly, in the case of Rs. 12 lakhs odd, it is the figure entered in the books in the accounting year relating to the transactions which is taxable.  "

A absented himself during the course of the trial and the judge asked E to sit in place of A and proceeded with the trial for some days with B, D and E. Later on A appeared and the trial continued till the end with the four assessors A, B, D and E: Held, (i) that the mere fact that D who had not been summoned was allowed to sit as an assessor when the trial commenced did not vitiate the trial as it was a mere irregularity and did not cause any failure of justice; King Emperor v. Ramsidh Rai (39 Cr. L.J. 725) approved. Balak Singh v. Emperor (A.LR. 1918 Pat. 420) explained. (ii) though sub-section (1) of s. 285 imposes a duty on the judge to find out whether there was sufficient cause for the absence of an assessor and to consider whether it is not possible to enforce his attendance, it should be presumed that he has done so when be proceeds with the trial in his absence and a mere omission to record reasons for proceeding with the trial without the absent assessor would not by itself vitiate the trial ; {iii) a sessions judge, however, has no jurisdiction to substitute another person for any assessor who absents himself during the trial or to reinstate the absent assessor when be re-appears and continue the trial with four assessors when the trial commenced with three assessors, and the trial in question was therefore illegal.

Section 22(1) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, provided that no appeal against an order of assessment should be entertained by the prescribed authority unless it was satisfied that such amount of tax as the appellant might admit to be due from him, had been paid. This Act was amended on the 25th November, 1949, and s. 22(1) as amended provided that no appeal should be admitted by the said authority unless such appeal was accompanied by satisfactory proof of the payment of the tax in respect of which the appeal had been preferred. On the 28th of November, 1947, the appellant submitted a return to the Sales Tax Officer, who, financing that the turnover exceeded 2 lacs, submitted the case to the Assistant Commissioner for disposal and the latter made an assessment on the 8th April, 1950. The appellant preferred an appeal on the 10th May, 1950, without depositing the amount of tax in respect of which he had appeared. The Board of revenue was of opinion that s. 22(1) as amended applied to the case as the assessment was made, and the appeal was preferred, after the amendment came into force, and rejected the appeal. Held, (i) that the appellant had a vested right to appeal when the proceedings were initiated, i.e., in 1947, and his right to appeal was governed by the law as it existed on that date; (ii) that the amendment of 1950 cannot be regarded as a mere alteration in procedure or an alteration regulating the exercise of the right of appeal, but whittled down the right itself, and it and no retrospective effect as the Amendment Act of 1950 did not expressly or by necessary intendment give it retrospective effect, and the appeal could not therefore he rejected for non-payment of the tax - in respect of which the appeal was preferred.

ZOS-Constit11tion of India, 1950, s. 226-Power of Registrar w reject application if within is likely to deceive to cause confusion Decision in passing of action, whether conclusive. Section 76(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, provides that an appeal shall lie from any decision of the Registrar under the Act or the rules made thereunder, to the High Court having jurisdiction, but the Act did not make any provision with regard to the procedure to be followed by the High Court in the appeal or as to whether the order of the High Court was appealable: Held, that the High Court had to exercise its appellate jurisdiction under s. 76 of the Act in the same manner as it exercised its other appellate jurisdiction, and when such jurisdiction was exercised by a Single Judge, his judgment was appealable under cl. 15 of the letters Patent. National Telephone Co. v. Postmaster General ([l 913] A.C. 546), R. M.A. R. A. Adikavi Chettiar v. Ra. Chandrasekhar Thevar (74 I.A. 264), Secretary of State v.

The power conferred by s. 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, on the High Courts, of making rules for the exercise of their jurisdiction by Single Judges or by Division~ Courts could be exercised not only in respect to such jurisdiction as the High Court~ possessed when the Act of 1016 came into 1933 force but also in respect of jurisdictions conferred on the High -- Court by subsequent legislation, e.g., s. 76 of the Trade :larks Act . .National Sewing Coder the rules of construction enunciated in s. 8 of the Thread Go. Ltd. General Clauses Act and s. 38 of the Interpretation Act, which v. . are of general application, the reference to s. 108 of the Govern\u00b7 Jrunes Chadwick ment of India Act, 1915, in cl. 15 of the Letters Patent should, awl Bros. Ltd. after the enactment of the Constitution of 1950, be read as reference to the corresponding provisions of art. 225 of the Constitution. The ambit of the power conferred on the High Courts by s. 108 of the Government of India Act, 1915, is not limited by s. 106(1) of the said Act or by cl. 16 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court. Indian Electric Works v. Registrar of Trade Marks (A.LR. 194 7 Cal. 49) overruled. Secretary of State v. Flask & Co. (67 I.A. 222) and the Gurdwara Case (63 I.A. 180) distinguished. The respondents, a company registered in England, manufactured sewing thread with the device of an Eagle with outspread wings known as the \"Eagle lfark\" as their trade mark, and since 1896 this thread was being sold in the Indian markets on an scale. The appellants, a company registered in India, began in 1940 to sell sewing thread with the device of a bird resembling an eagle with wings fully spread out with the words \"Eagle Brand\" as their mark. On the objection of the respondents the appellants subsequently changed the name to \"Vulture Brand\" without changing the mark in other respects. The respondents instituted an action against the appellants for passing off, but that was dismissed. The appellants subsequently applied for registration of their trade mark but their application was dismissed by the Registrar on the ground that the appellants' mark so nearly resembled the respondents' mark as to be likely to deceive the public and cause confusion. This order was reversed by a Single Judge of the High Court of Bombay but restored on appeal by a Division Bench: Held (i) that the judgment of the Division Bench upholding the order of the Registrar rejecting the application, on the ground that the mark was likely to deceive and cause confusion, was right; (ii) that the considerations relevant in a passing off action are somewhat different from those which are relevant in an application for registration of a trade mark under the Trade Marks Act, and the earlier judgment of the High Court in the action for passing off Vas not conclusive on the matter.

The petitioner, whose estate was taken over by the Court of Wards under the above-mentioned provisions of law, applied for relief under art. 32 of the Constitution for restoration of his estate and other appropriate reliefs: Held, (i) that the result of the combined operation of s. 112 of Act XLII of 1950 and the provisions of ss. 6 and 7 of Regulation I of 1888 was that the Court of Wards could in its own discretion and on its subjective determination assume the superintendence of the property of a landlord who habitually infringed the rights of his tenants, and the exercise of .the discretion of the Court of Wards cannot be questioned in a civil court: s. 112 of Act XLII of 1950 read with the provisions of Regulation I of 1888 therefore infringed the fundamental rights of the petitioner guaranteed by art. 19 (1) of the Constitution and was to that extent void; (ii) the provisions of s. 112 cannot be regarded as a \"reasonable\" restriction imposed in the interests of the general public on the exercise of the right conferred by art. 19 (1) (f), because they completely negatived the right by making its enjoyment depend on the mere discretion of the executive; (iii) that s. 112 was not validated by art. 31-A of the Constitution as it was not \"a law providing for the acquisition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinction or modification of any such rights\" within the meaning of art.

On the 5th May, 1944,  they decided to keep the advance amounts under a new heading \"Contracts Advance Fixed Deposit Account\" and to return the advance  amounts in full after the completion of each contract and payment  of the full value of the bales supplied. On the 5th December,  1944, they changed the name of this account into \"Security Deposit\" account, and on the 14th February, 1945, the assesses decided to modify the arrangement further and demand a certain sum  from each customer towards Security Deposit and keep the same  with the assesses so long as the business connection with the  customer under the forward contracts continued. Interest was also  allowed on the amount of the deposit. The question being whether  the advance amounts received by the assesses as deposit were  \"borrowed money,'' within the meaning of Rule 2-A of the Rules  in the Second Schedule to the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and  should not be deducted in computing the average capital used for  the purposes of the business:  Held, (i) that the advance amounts received before the 5th  May, 1944, were only advance payments of the price, to be adjusted on delivery, and could in no sense he regarded as borrowed  money;  (ii) the amounts received after the 5th May, 1944, up to  14th February, 1945, were also, having regard to the terms of the arrangement then in force, more in the nature of trading - receipts than of security deposits as they were reaJly advance K.

        "HeadNote": " The Legislature of Bombay passed an Act entitled the Bombay Sales Tax ,Act, 1952, which imposed (by s. 5) a general tax on every dealer whose turnover in Respect of sales within the State of Bombay during the prescribed period exceeded Rs. 30,000 and (by s. 10) a special tax on every dealer whose turnover in respect of sales of special goods made within the State of Bombay exceeded Rs. 5,000 during the prescribed period. 'the term 'sale' was defined [in s. 2 (l4)] as meaning any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration, and an Explanation to this definition provided the; the sale of any goods which have actually been delivered in the State of Bombay as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consun1ption in the said State shall be deemed, for the purposes of the Act, to have taken place in the said State irrespective of the fact that the property in the goods has any reason of such sale, passed in another state. Rules 5 and 6 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1952, which were brought into force on the same day on which ss. 5 and 10 of the Bombay Sales Tax Act came into force provided for the deduction of the following sales in calculating the taxable turnover, \u00b7viz., sales which take place (a) in the course of the The  import of the goods into, or the export of the goods out of, the motor\u00ab (India) territory of India, and (b) in the course of inter-State trade or Ltd. and Other-\u00bb commerce (being the two kinds of sales referred to cl. (l)(b) and cl. (2) respectively of art. 286 of the Constitution). Rule 5 (2) (i), however, required, as a condition of the aforesaid deductions, though , the goods should be consigned by a railway, shipping or aircraft company or country boat registered for carrying cargo or public motor transport service or by registered post. In \u2022n application under art. 2% of the Constitution challenging the validity of the Act and praying inter alia for a writ against the State of Bombay and the Collector of Sales Tax, Bombay, restraining them from enforcing the provisions of the Act, the High Court of Bombay held that the definition of 'sale' in the Act was so wide as to include the three categories of sale exempted by art. 286 of the Constitution from the imposition of tax by the States, and as the Act imposed a tax on all such sales, it was wholly void. On appeal per (Pata;ija.li Sastri 0. J., Nukherjea, Ghulam Rasan and Bhagwati JJ,-Bose J. dissenting)-that the Bombay Sales Tax Act (XXIV of 1952) was not ultra vires the State Legis\u0002lature on the ground that it contravened art. 14 or art. 286 of the Constitution. Bui clause (i) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 5 of the Bombay Sales Tax Rules, 1952, was ultra vires in so far as it provided that in order that sales mentioned in clause (1) (b) and clause (2) of art. 286 of the Constitution may be exempt from tax, the goods shall be consigned only through a railway, shipping or aircraft company or country boat registered for carrying cargo or public motor transport service or by registered post. These provisions of Rule 5 (2) (i) were, however, severable from the other provisions of the Act and could be ignored. "

        "HeadNote": " The Court of Waras granted to the appellants a large area of land belonging to the Bettiah Raj which was then under the management of the Court of Wards, on the recommendation of the Board of Revenue, at half the usual rates. A few years later, lie Working Committee of the Indian National Congress expressed the opinion that the settlement of the lands was against public interest, and in 1950, the Bihar Legislature passed an Act called the Sathi Lands (Restoration) Act, 1950, which declared that, notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force the settlement granted to the appellants shall be null and void and that no party to the settlement or his successors in interest shall be deemed to have acquired any right or incurred any liability thereunder, and empowered the Collector to eject the appellants if they refused to restore the lands. The appellants, alleging that the Act was unconstitutional, applied under article 226 of the Constitution for a writ of mandamus against the State of Bihar restraining it from taking any action under the Act. It was found that there were several other settlements of lands belonging to the Bettiah Raj on similar terms against which the Government had taken no action: Held, that the dispute between the appellants and the Stale was really a private dispute and a matter to be determined by a judicial tribunal in accordance with the law applicable to the case, and, as the Legislature had, in passing the impugned enactment singled out the appellants and deprived them of their right to have this dispute adjudicated upon by a duly constituted Court, the enactment contravened the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution which guarantees to every citizen the equal protection of the laws, and was void and Another Legislation which singles out a particular individual from his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which is not imposed upon the others and against which even the right of complaint is taken away is highly discriminatory. Though the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment and it has to be presumed that a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people, yet when on the face of a statute there is no classification at all, and no attempt has been made to select any individual or group with reference to any differentiating attribute peculiar to that individual or group and not possessed by others, this presumption is of little or no assistance to the State.

When the court itself is attacked, the summary jurisdiction by way of contempt \u00b7proceedings must be exercised with scrupulous care and only when the case is clear and beyond reasonable doubt. There are two primary considerations which should weigh with the court in such cases, viz., first, weather the reflection on the conduct or character of the judge is within the limits of fair and reasonable criticism, and secondly, whether it is a mere libel or defamation of the judge or amounts to a contempt of the court. If it is a mere defamatory attack on the judge and is not calculated to interfere with the due course of justice or the proper administration of the law by such court, it is not proper to proceed by way of contempt. Where the question arises whether a defamatory statement directed against a judge is calculated to undermine the confidence of the public in the competency or integrity of the judge or is likely to deflect the court itself from a strict and unhesitant performance of its duties, all the surrounding facts and circumstances under which the statement was made and the degree of publicity that was given to it would be relevant circumstances. The c1uestion is not to be determined solely with reference to the' language or contents of the statement made. The Executive Committee of a District Bar Association received several complaints against the way in which the Judicial Magistrate and the Revenue Officer of the District disposed of cases and behaved towards litigants and lawyers, and passed a resolution which stated that ''it was their considered opinion that the two officers are thoroughly incompetent in law, do not inspire confidence in their judicial work, and given to stating wrong facts when passing orders and are overbearing and discourteous to the litigant public and lawyers alike\" and gave a list of various complaints against the officers. This resolution was passed in camera, typed out by the President himself and forwarded confidentially to the District Magistrate. Commissioner of the Division, and the Chief Secretary and Premier of the State. The District Magistrate moved the High Court of Allahabad to take action against the appellants, who had passed the resolution, for contempt of court. The High Court held that the appellants were guilty of contempt, but accepted their apology. On appeal: Held, that in the light of all the circumstances of the case, the contempt, if any, was only of a technical character and that after the affidavits\" bad been filed on behalf of the appellants before the High Court, the proceedings against them should have been dropped.

        "HeadNote": " The petitioners, who were residents of a municipality, alleging that they had been deprived of their rights to exercise their votes and to seek their election as candidates in certain by. elections to the Municipal Board, as those by-elections were held on communal lines on the basis of separate electorates contrary to the provisions of the Constitution, applied for writs under art. 32 of the Constitution for preventing the elected candidates from acting as members of the Board, and the District Magistrate and Civil Judge from holding any meetings of the Board: Held, that, though a law which provides for elections on the basis of separate electorates for members of different religions communities offends against art. 15(1) of the Constitution and an election held after the Constitution in pursuance of such a law subject to cl. 4 would be void, the right which the petitioners claimed as rate-payers in the municipality to insist that the Board should be legally constituted and that persons who have not been properly elected should not be allowed to take part in the proceedings of the Board was outside the purview of art. 32 of the Constitution inasmuch as such a right, even if it existed, was not a fundamental right conferred by Part III of the Constitution. Held further, that the alleged infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioners under art. 15(1) and art. 14, that is, the discrimination practised against them related to rights which they in fact never sought to exercise and took no ste1~s to assert while there was occasion for doing so and the petitioners were therefore entitled to no relief under art\u00b7 32 of the Constitution.
